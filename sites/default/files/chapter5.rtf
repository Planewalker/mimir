s folk, whether man, woman, or spirit, would gather at
 night to dance and sing together around blazing fires. The Athar had formed the hamlet  as an oasis for those seeking a peaceful home away from the manipulations of the gods and their followers. Their lives weren\rquote 
t easy, but no day was wasted, each was worth living.
\par 
\par That blithe energy had fallen away, however, and the air became choked by bitterness and hatred. The passion which filled their hearts turned to jealousy and rage. What had started as a small feud between lovers had grown to consume the whole 
village, turning family against family and dividing the town. Now a wall split the valley and its residents, sitting like an open wound across the realm\rquote 
s face. A necessary evil, as if looking at the ugly gray stone was better than seeing those on the othe
r side. The poison infecting the town had become so intense that now the whole valley was on the verge on shifting to another plane. Arborea was rejecting them, and no one could say where they\rquote 
d end up. The whole matter only divided them further. In his desperation to find some resolution, Dillan had even sought help from the pantheon\rquote 
s that dwelled nearby, but their clerics had been turned away. The gods had no interest in easing the pain of those who had rejected them.
\par 
\par A hand on his shoulder made Dillan jump. \'93Hey.\'94 He turned around to look at Alan, who smiled at him reassuringly. \'93That gloomy look doesn\rquote t suit you. Trust me, its going to be alright.\'94
 Alan pulled him close and their lips met, softly at first but then passionately as their arms locked around one another. When they parted, tears were sliding down Dillan\rquote s cheeks. Alan leaned forward to kiss them away, then said \'93
You must have hope, they need us to be strong.\'94
\par 
\par Dillan shook his head, \'93But does it have to be this way?! Do you really need to-\'94
\par 
\par \'93It\rquote s my right to choose, my freedom to give. You must believe in what we do, Dillan. The gods would rather see our people suffer, and our friends have forgotten what it is we fight for. If we don\rquote 
t trust in each other, in the principles we have tried to live our lives by, then the magic will fail and everything will be for naught.\'94

Dillan nodded slowly, his fingers tracing the silver blade in his hand. Alan lifted his chin up into another kiss and the two fell onto the bed of wild grass and scattered lea

In the end, virtually all of the planes are connected: the Inner Planes connect to the Prime Material through the Ethereal, the Prime Material connects to the Outer Planes through the Astral, and the Outer Planes connect to the Inner 
Planes through the Ordial. That isn\rquote t to say all the planes are accessible from one another, however. Primes don\rquote 
t recognize this because the Prime Material connects to both the Ethereal and the Astral Planes (and they know nothing of the Ordial); but the 
Inner Planes have no direct access to the Astral, and the Outer Planes have no connection to the Ethereal. When someone casts a spell that creates a connection to a plane that isn\rquote 
t bordered by the current plane, the spell simply fails. For example, casting }{\i\f30\fs20 etherealness}{\f30\fs20  on the Outer Planes isn\rquote t going to work; there\rquote s no Ethereal Plane to connect to. The same applies to casting }{\i\f30\fs20 
astral projection}{\f30\fs20  on one of the Inner Planes. That\rquote s why every spellcaster should have an understanding of the cosmology and dimensional relations before venturing out on to the planes.
\par 
\par Dimensional relations are not quite as restrictive as you might imagine. It only applies to spells that affect planar boundaries; thus summoning, banishing, and divination spells work normally in most
 parts of the multiverse. In addition, because the Pseudo Planes are coexistent with the entire multiverse, spells that draw on the Planes of Dream, Shadow, or Time operate as well. Extradimensional spaces are a special case. These tiny pockets of space a
re hidden from normal senses and can be found on just about any plane, with the exception of the Astral Plane due to its unique nature. Table 5-1 has a list of spells from the }{\i\f30\fs20 Player\rquote s Handbook}{\f30\fs20 
 that are affected by dimensional relations. Apply the same principles to new spells and powers from the }{\i\f30\fs20 Expanded Psionics Handbook}{\f30\fs20  and }{\i\f30\fs20 Planescape Campaign Setting}{\f30\fs20 .

Spellcasters have to be mindful of the schools and types of spells they use on different planes. Every plane treats the schools and subtypes differently; spells and spell-like abilities may be enhanced, impeded, limited, or altered in some other way depen
d
ing on where they are cast. These effects are not even constant for a single plane; various layers or realms of a plane may alter how magic operates in completely different ways. Most spell alterations are based on the nature of the plane or that of the p
residing deities, and can be overridden by gods or particularly clever mortals. Of course, some spell alterations can be quite beneficial, but overall it\rquote s better to have an idea what the outcome will be before casting the spell.
\par 
\par Like most things, belief i
s often the biggest factor in how magic is affected on the planes. There are a countless number of ways different spellcasters can achieve similar results, but in regions where one paradigm of magic is dominant other methods of magic will often become lim
ited. For example, the planars of Ysgard mostly worship the Asgardian Pantheon, which has since time began used the lore of runes as a source of power and wisdom. Furthermore, Ysgard is a plane of hard work and perseverance; life there isn\rquote 
t easy unless you\rquote 
ve put in the effort to make it so. Thus, you can expect spells that create something for nothing to have trouble functioning, but incorporating the rune lore (and thus adapting to the predominant belief) might improve a spellcaster\rquote 
s chances of performin
g spells successfully. Another more poignant example is the Abyss; rumors hold that either the Abyssal Lords or the plane itself twists all magic so that it can bring about only evil results, making it extremely dangerous for spellcasters who do not make 
some sort of deal with the local demons.
\par 
\par There are four categories of magic traits. The first three are the most spread throughout a single plane and unlikely to change, while the last can change from realm to realm or over time.
\par }{\b\f30\fs20 
\par Enhanced Magic:}{\f30\fs20  Particula
r spells and spell-like abilities are easier to use or are more powerful in effect on these planes. If a spell is enhanced, certain metamagic feats can be applied to it without changing the spell slot required or casting time. Spellcasters on that plane a
re considered to have this feat for the purpose of applying it to that spell.
\par }{\b\f30\fs20 
\par Impeded Magic}{\f30\fs20 : Particular spells and spell-like abilities are more difficult to cast on these planes, often because the nature of the plane interferes with the spell. Impeded mag
ic planes may stop spells based on their school, subschool, descriptors, or level. Individual spells are rarely impeded on a plane-wide basis, but they may be impeded in the realm of a god or other powerful being. To cast an impeded spell, the caster must
 make a Spellcraft check (DC 15 + the level of the spell). If the check fails, the spell does not function and is lost.
\par }{\b\f30\fs20 
\par Limited Magic}{\f30\fs20 : These planes only permit spells and spell-like abilities from certain schools, subschools, descriptors, or levels to be cast. Other spells and spell-like abilities simply do not work.
\par }{\b\f30\fs20 
\par Altered Magic}{\f30\fs20 : These planes have specific and unique changes to certain spells based on their school, subschool, descriptors, level, or by the spell itself. The changes can be as minor as an a
dditional visual or auditory effect, the requirement for a certain type of material component, or the spell could produce a completely opposite effect than what was intended. Planes with altered magic represent the greatest hazard to spellcasters, and are
 good reason to give pause before casting spells on a plane you\rquote re not familiar with.

Whether arcane, divine, or psionic, magical items carry their magic within. Yet magical equipment is still affected by dimensional relations and spell alterations, particularly any which simulate spells. Take a }{\i\f30\fs20 ring of invisibility }{
\f30\fs20 to a plane where illusion spells do not function and the ring won\rquote t work either. More importantly, some magical items may attract attention from the natives of 
a plane. An unholy weapon brought onto the Upper Planes is a beacon of evil to the celestials and deities there. Spells or equipment that can be used to hide magical auras are especially useful when carrying such items.

\par }\pard \qj \li0\ri0\widctlpar\intbl\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0 {\f30\fs20 
For simplicity, most planes are only listed with the enhanced, impeded, or limited magic traits. The planes are far more complicated, however, and the gods often interfere directly in how spells operate. Rather than come up with a daunting list of rule
s for each plane, we leave it to individual DMs to invent unique alterations as befitting the region and the story. Specific spell alterations have the potential to add an extra degree of excitement and surprise to an encounter on the planes, and most of 
a
ll they can develop the character of a plane. Used to an extreme, however, they can become a nuisance to players and a distraction from the other aspects of an adventure. DMs are encouraged to use altered magic as a tool to add depth to each locale and as
 a way of getting spellcasters to really think about their magic paradigms. When using altered magic keep in mind that the planes are highly morphic, and it\rquote 
s possible that a spell alteration that existed the day before no longer applies, particular when it\rquote s only a hindrance to the players enjoying themselves.
\par 
\par When using the altered magic trait, the DM may decide to introduce spell keys. Spell keys attune the caster\rquote s spell to the magical forces of a plane, allowing spells to operate normally when they wou
ld otherwise be altered. Like portal keys, they can come in nearly any form, such as drawing a rune in the air, whistling a tune, or offering a sacrifice, and are normally based on the specific plane and spell.
\par 
\par Spell keys come in two types: general and sp
ecific. General spell keys allow spellcasters to use a school, subschool, or descriptor of spells correctly, such as allowing abjurations to operate correctly in the Abyss or making summoning work in Baator. Specific spell keys are tied to a single spell 
and region, for instance allowing }{\i\f30\fs20 power word: kill}{\f30\fs20 
 to work on Mount Celestia. Using spell keys may require extending the casting time of a spell and cannot be negated by metamagic feats. Thus, a spell key that requires playing a flute cannot be used with Si
lent Spell, and one that requires tracing a rune cannot be used with Still Spell. They also cannot be used in conjunction with magic items to attune their magical effects to the plane. Nonetheless, spell keys are highly prized by spellcasters on the plane
s, creating a market for those willing to sell their secrets (or make them up). There aren\rquote t spell keys for every situation, however, as it seems some planar absolutes just cannot be bypassed.\cell }\pard

rst formed the deities agreed that everything in existence would be given a True Name \endash  not just what it would be called, but what it }{\i\f30\fs20 was}{\f30\fs20 
. The True Name would define its innermost characteristics and its place in the multiverse. Thus True Names held tremen
dous power not only over its owner, but also over every part of the multiverse it touched. Some theorize that the gods meant to keep the Names among themselves, using them as a means to categorize and comprehend their many creations. Somehow knowledge of 
T
rue Names landed in the hands of mortals, however (some attribute this to a spiteful chaotic deity), and mortals soon began mastering as much of their use as they were able. Whether the legend is true or not, knowledge of True Names has long been a valuab
le commodity on the planes. While those capable of understanding them are quite rare, the power they possess is enough to keep most planar creatures at least nominally interested in rumors concerning them.
\par 
\par In truth, True Names are actually only the most ba
sic representation of a much grander pattern, a language intimately tied to the fabric of existence. So complex and powerful to surpass even the complete understanding of the gods, most mortals are only able to grasp the smallest details of the language a
n
d must take the True Names Lore feat to comprehend its usage. Even the Fraternity of Order has only a very small collection of Names despite centuries of research and cataloging, and that is only available to those of the highest rank. Some theorize that 
a
ll magic is based off this system, and that the greatest archmages are those who have begun to perceive the entire multiverse as an expression of this language. Outsiders often have a better grasp of True Names compared to mortals, and most know their own
 and maybe even the Names of their servants. The gods, on the other hand, are believed not to possess such Names, though if they did they surely would have gone to such extreme lengths to remove any record of them for the point to be a moot point.
\par 
\par Despite being an intrinsically lawful facet of existence, there is little in the way of codified knowledge regarding True Names. There seems to be enough flexibility in their use that scholars cannot agree on what they are capable of given the knowledge o
f those who use them. Some individuals believe that living creatures aren\rquote 
t the only things to possess True Names, but inanimate objects, ideas, and even events in time do as well. One of their only universal traits seems to be the fact that possessing a Tr
ue Name gives you profound knowledge and power over what it represents. Thus, mortal spellcasters often seek them out in hopes of binding more powerful creatures to their whim, though it\rquote s never that easy.
\par 
\par It bears repeating that few individuals ever disc
over True Names, let alone devote themselves to understanding them. At the same time, their use is often at the center of legends where individuals seek out a True Name for truly epic tasks, or in even more remarkable tales the heroes achieve wisdom and p
o
wer by coming to understand their own Names. Most adventures pursue rumors of True Names without ever coming close to the power they seek, however, while merchants selling rare tomes of lost Names by the dozens abound on the streets of major planar cities
.
 Point being, players should not expect to see them used in every campaign, and they are best used as plot elements by the DM. If a player is considering taking the True Names Lore feat they should discuss the matter with the DM to determine if True Names
 will be used in the game and if the character will have the time necessary to study them.
\par 
\par }{\b\f30\fs20 Learning True Names:}{\f30\fs20  Understanding True Names is only the beginning, actually acquiring one is where the real difficulty comes in. Discovering True Names is best han
dled as its own adventure or fit into a long-term story by the DM. Learning any Name is an extraordinary event after all, and should come as a result of great effort and sacrifice. Characters will likely have to gather individual fragments over time by co
mbining several different methods and leads. Syllables of a Name may be slowly put together by examining every aspect of someone\rquote 
s life, from their origin and past actions, to their personality and motivations, and even their connection to people and places
 in the multiverse. Few people understand themselves well enough to know their own Name, however, and such understanding can take a lifetime to achieve. Therefore most adventurers also explore places such as the Astral, Dream, or Shadow Plane where lost l
o
re or ephemeral knowledge can sometimes be found, or brave alien regions such as the Hinterlands or the Far Realm in hopes that wisdom can found in the madness there. It may also require bargaining with exemplar or even deities, though such deals always c
o
me with a high price. In the end, such endeavors almost always bring the characters closer to understanding the person representing by the Name, and that fact alone often dissuades researchers, for being able to know the minds of creatures such as archfie
n
ds can be enough to draw someone into their dark ways. Even after completing learning a True Name characters are likely to attract attention from those who would steal such knowledge or who seek to ensure no one else possesses such power. Simply put, the 
more powerful the individual represented by the Name the more likely other planewalkers, exemplar, and other forces will be interested in how that power is used, to say nothing of whoever the Name belongs to.
\par 
\par If the DM feels that a particular True Name can
 be found through occult research and there is sufficient time to allow for such an endeavor, they may instead allow characters to simply put forth the money and the time necessary. In this case research typically requires access to libraries and other co
nsultants costing at least 1,000 gold and the use of the }{\i\f30\fs20 legend lore}{\f30\fs20  spell every week, for one week per 2 HD of the creature (modified as the DM feels appropriate). At the end of this period the character must cast }{\i\f30\fs20 
commune}{\f30\fs20  or }{\i\f30\fs20 contact other plane}{\f30\fs20  and then make an appropriate Knowledge check against a DC equal to 10 + the creature\rquote 
s Hit Dice (again, modified by the DM). If successful they have discovered the True Name, while failure means the research must begin again from scratch. The only Names that have sur
vived with any regularity are those of various fiends, which often end up landing in the hands of arrogant prime wizards. Naturally, most fiends spend a great deal of resources tracking down and removing any evidence of their Names, though a few are bold 
enough to use such knowledge as a lure for unprepared wizards.
\par 
\par }{\b\f30\fs20 Using True Names:}{\f30\fs20  Knowing another creature\rquote s True Name grants a great deal of power over them, and it is for that reason exemplar go to such lengths to protect their Names. Typical powers granted by knowing a creature

The ultimate manipulation of True Names lies in a powerful ritual involving multiple rhyming verses. The speaker must be within 30 feet of the target and begins by calling out the target\rquote 
s True Name and arcane words that describe its nature, a process whic
h takes 3 full rounds. The speaker must then say a number of rhyming verses dependent on the desired effect and make a successful Knowledge (arcana) check for each effect (see Table 5-3). Unless otherwise stated each verse requires one full round to speak

 level caster. The speaker knows whether an effect succeeds, and may combine and retry effects, continuing as long as they can feasibly do so at the DM\rquote 
s discretion. Any interruption ruins the ritual, and frees the target from any of its effects. Because of the rhyming verses, it is advisable to prepare the ritual ahead of time and to have protections against interruptions. Having th
e creature restrained, such as through a }{\i\f30\fs20 magic circle}{\f30\fs20 , is also very helpful.

Few schools of the arcane are held in such awe and fear as that of wild magic. Drawing on chaos itself, practitioners of wild magic tap into a prima
l force of creativity and destruction greater than the most powerful archmages. Yet the power it grants is also what frightens away most would be wild mages and draws the ire of others, for even the most skilled wild mages are playing a game of chance, an
d the consequences are rarely limited to the caster alone.
\par 
\par No one is quite sure where or when wild magic was first discovered. It has been practiced on dozens of prime worlds as well as isolated parts of the planes for millennia. Confounding any attempt to
 understand its origins is the fact that the techniques used and results achieved with wild magic vary widely from place to place. Indeed, one of the main characteristics of wild magic seems to be that it can be approached from any angle, and numerous met
hods have been noted on the planes by those who research such things. It cannot be said that there is any \'93correct\'94
 form of wild magic, though some are certainly more powerful (and dangerous) than others. It should come as no surprise that the Xaositects ha
ve long demonstrated an affinity for wild magic, and the majority of wild mages on the planes are found among that faction, though the idea of it being widely taught among its members seems highly unlikely. The tanar\rquote 
ri also seem to enjoy finding creative 
uses for wild magic in the Blood War, and several other organizations have attempted to gather information on the various types of wild magic practiced on the planes, including the Bleak Cabal, the Fated, and the Fraternity of Order. Though wild magic is 
inherently chaotic, spellcasters of any alignment may use it, and indeed many lawful spellcasters study it in the hope of pinning it down in concrete principles.
\par 
\par The rules for wild magic described here are a basic and free form approach that can be used on
 its own or in conjunction with another variant system. While wild magic is theoretically capable of just about anything the caster or the DM imagines, it is most often used to modify a normal spell in hopes of enhancing its effectiveness. Learning to use
 wild magic in this manner requires taking the Wild Spell metamagic feat and may involve studying under a wild mage. Unlike most metamagic feats, it does not need to be applied to a spell when it\rquote 
s being memorized and does not increase the casting time or l
evel of the spell. The player simply chooses to channel chaos into their spell at the time of casting and rolls a d20. Compare the results of the roll to the Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells table in Chapter 1 of the }{\i\f30\fs20 Player\rquote 
s Handbook}{\f30\fs20  and add the modifie
r to the caster level of the spell (minimum caster level 1). Thus a wild spell is equally likely of being stronger or weaker than it would normally be. If the range of the spell becomes too short to reach its target it simply fails in the case of a target
ed spell or activates prematurely in the case of an area-effect spell.
\par 
\par }{\b\f30\fs20 Wild Surges:}{\f30\fs20  If the player rolled a 1, 5, 10, 15, or 20 then chaos has infected the spell and a wild surge has occurred. Wild surges cause uncontrollable alterations to how the spell fu
nctions by changing its effectiveness, giving it strange side effects, or transforming it into a different effect entirely. Wild surges can be beneficial, harmful, or just plain random and are the primary reason why wild mages are regarded with fear. To d
e
termine the nature of a wild surge the DM secretly makes a wild surge check by rolling a d20; the higher the result the more beneficial it is to the spellcaster or their allies, the lower the result the more detrimental it is. The exact effect can be just
 about anything, though wild surges are often more dramatic the higher the level of the spell being cast.
\par 
\par No extended list of effects can truly capture the variety of wild surges, Instead, the DM is encouraged to come up with wild surges on a case by case 
basis as appropriate for the characters and the theme of the story. Having a character suddenly sprout flowers from their hair or start speaking gibberish adds some humor to the game, but it probably isn\rquote t appropriate if the game\rquote 
s theme is horror or the c
haracters are at the climax of the story. Purely mechanic effects, on the other hand, rob wild magic of its flavor and encourage players to view it as just another type of magic. While requiring the DM to come up with wild surges requires more work, with 
some practice a DM can learn to use wild surges as minor plot devices while being able to

 magic, and there are bound to be some strange and unusual outcomes to wild surges. There\rquote s also nothing wrong with holding off on deciding how a wild surge manifests; mayb
e the effect was too subtle for the characters to notice immediately or maybe the forces of chaos are hanging over the caster\rquote 
s head waiting for an appropriate outlet. A little suspense can go along way to add to the thrill of wild magic. See Table 5-4 for a few examples of wild surges for a generic spell.
\par 
\par }{\b\f30\fs20 Chaos Taints and Epiphanies:}{\f30\fs20  Whenever the DM rolls a 1 or 20 on a wild surge check an extreme wild surge occurs in the form of a chaos taint or an epiphany respectively. Chaos taints are acquired when a 
spellcaster loses control over the chaotic energies and becomes a victim of the very forces they are attempting to channel. The spell itself may or may not work, but either way the wild mage has paid the price for experimenting with such power. Unlike mos
t wild surges, chaos taints are detrimental effects that stay with the caster permanently, marking them with strange physical transformations or cursing them with supernatural ailments. The caster\rquote 
s skin might change to the color and texture of stone, they may be accompanied by a soft wailing and cold wind wherever they walk, or they may feel the uncontrollable urge to yell hysterically whenever they sense magic being used on them. There\rquote 
s no telling how a chaos taint will manifest, but they always serve as a hindrance to the mage or set them apart from their peers. Like most wild surges, the severity of a chaos taint is often based on the level of the spell being cast. In the end it
\rquote s up to the DM to determine if there are any mechanical benefits or penalties for a given chaos taint. The character must find a way to live with their new condition as nothing short of }{\i\f30\fs20 wish}{\f30\fs20 
 spell can remove a chaos taint.
\par 
\par Epiphanies, on the other hand, are about the best thing a wild mage can hope for. Instead of losing control of their spell the forces of chaos opens the character\rquote 
s eyes and allows them to view the multiverse in a completely new light. For an instant the character realizes how limited their perceptions have been and just how much reality bends to their will. Though not a }{\i\f30\fs20 miracle}{\f30\fs20  or }{
\i\f30\fs20 wish}{\f30\fs20  spell per se, seemingly impossible events of good luck occur and the DM may even decide to ask the player for input as to what they would most desire as an outcome
 of the wild surge. A Harmonium patrol may suddenly round the corner and decide to help the characters subdue an opponent, a balor pursuing the party may find its wings breaking apart as if made of dust, or a portal may spontaneously open where there was 
n
one before. Others may mistake the events as mere coincidence, but the wild mage knows the truth. Epiphanies may even remove the effects of a chaos taint, though this happens rarely and can never remove more a single one chaos taint. Just as chaos taints 
can be harsh awakenings to the perils of wild magic, epiphanies are an addictive taste of what it can accomplish.

Though the Dustmen are hardly a martial order, they must often go to great lengths to defend their strongholds from thieves and darker creatures seeking the bodies and souls that come into their care. This spell was developed in order to help them crea
te more powerful undead guards. }{\i\f30\fs20 Bone craft}{\f30\fs20  grafts two corpses together into one, referred to as the composite body. When }{\i\f30\fs20 animate dead }{\f30\fs20 
is cast upon the composite body a skeleton or zombie more powerful than normal is created. This procedure can be performed
 multiple times, adding more corpses to the composite body to create a progressively more powerful undead minion. This spell is one of the faction\rquote 
s most guarded secrets and is only taught to its dedicated members; anyone that leaves the Dustmen is expected to destroy any copies of it they may possess
\par 
\par This spell improves the }{\i\f30\fs20 animated }{\f30\fs20 creature in several ways. Its total number of Hit Dice is equal to the highest of the two base creature\rquote s Hit Dice plus half of the second\rquote s (rounded up) plus 1. Furthermore, 
after combining three corpses of the same size a composite body one size larger is produced with the increased natural armor and natural attack damage appropriate to its size. Thus, grafting three medium corpses with 1 HD each and using }{\i\f30\fs20 
animate dead}{\f30\fs20  upon i
t would create a large skeleton or zombie with 5 HD, and grafting three large corpses with 5 HD each would create one huge skeleton or zombie with 13 HD. The two corpses that are to be fused together do not have to be the same size; a medium corpse could 
be added to a large composite body and its size would only increase once enough medium corpses had been added to it.
\par 
\par The composite body automatically possesses all weapon proficiencies, feats, and subtypes that the base bodies would have once }{\i\f30\fs20 animate dead}{\f30\fs20  
was cast upon it. You may also choose to give it any natural attacks of the base creatures, such as claw or bite attacks. More importantly, every use of }{\i\f30\fs20 bone craft}{\f30\fs20 
 allows you to grant the composite body two abilities from the list below. This is the true u
tility behind this spell, for with the proper grafting and stitching the undead creature created can threaten even skilled warriors. These abilities are cumulative over multiple castings; using }{\i\f30\fs20 bone craft}{\f30\fs20 
 to add a third corpse to composite body would allow you to add two more abilities in addition to whatever it possessed.
\par 
\par }{\i\f30\fs20 Additional Feat}{\f30\fs20 : The body gains a feat of your choosing that it meets the prerequisites for. It cannot take any feats which require class abilities, Intelligence, or anything else inappropriate at the DM\rquote s discretion.

\par 
\par }{\i\f30\fs20 Extra Attack}{\f30\fs20 : By adding an extra arm, maw, or tail the creature may make an extra secondary attack each round. It suffers penalties to its secondary attacks as normal, which can be reduced by the Multiattack feat.
\par 
\par }{\i\f30\fs20 Improved Movement}{\f30\fs20 : By adding an extra leg you increase the creature\rquote s base speed by 5 and grant it a +2 bonus to Jump checks and to resist tripping.
\par 
\par }{\i\f30\fs20 Special Abilities}{\f30\fs20 : With the DM\rquote s permission you may invent unusual abilities of your own. For instance, a zombie m
ay be able to fire its hand at a target as a projectile, or a huge skeleton may be able to grapple medium or smaller creatures and trap them within its hallow chest. The DM may decide that such special abilities constitute two or more choices in terms of 
this spell.
\par }{\i\f30\fs20 
\par Bone craft}{\f30\fs20  can only be used to combine a number of corpses equal to the caster\rquote s Intelligence modifier into one composite body. Each use}{\i\f30\fs20  }{\f30\fs20 
requires four hours of surgery plus an additional two for each time the spell has been used on the bodies before. For instance, grafting four skeletons together would require four hours for the first two, six to add the third, and eight to add the last.

Correspondence can be incredibly difficult on the planes, and though many courier services exist they are often stationed in the largest cities, leaving smaller towns and villages with little reliable contact with the rest of the mult
iverse. This simple spell creates a small personalized flying creature capable of delivering a prepared message nearly anywhere on the planes to someone you have met. This creature is a tiny chimerical beast unique to the caster based on their personality
 and other characteristics, enabling the distinguished eye to recognize the author of any }{\i\f30\fs20 curious courier }{\f30\fs20 
delivered a second time. The chimera is always capable of flying and possesses a limited plane-shifting ability that allows it to cross into coterminou
s planes, assuming nothing prevents planar travel. Thus it could move from one of the Outer Planes to the Astral and from there to the Prime Material Plane or any of the other Outer Planes, or continue through the Prime Material Plane to the Ethereal and 
I
nner Planes. The creature has an innate sense for the location of the recipient provided they are not disguised by magic and will eventually reach them assuming they are not in an area warded against interplanar travel and the creature is not intercepted 
by someone who knows to be looking for such a messenger.

Despite any illusions to the contrary, the Deaders know that this multiverse is but a shadow of true life, and that everyone here is already dead. Only individuals that believe this philosophy may use }{\i\f30\fs20 dead life}{\f30\fs20

 life from the targeted creature, bringing body and soul one step closer to True Death. The Dustmen rarely use this spell, for their respect of Death cautions against such tampering, but many among the faction also hope to have it used upon them in the be

\par The effects are determined by which saving throws the target fails. If they fail the Fortitude save, their body is transformed into something similar to undead creatures such as vampires. They
 grow cold and pallid, their sense of touch and taste are dulled, and their emotions wan to the point of being passionless and stoic. Their body no longer requires rest or sustenance, neither of which provides any of the pleasure they once did, and they n
e
ither grow nor heal naturally, meaning their body can become riddled with bare patches of skin and open wounds. Only negative energy provides the means to heal damage, but positive energy now has the opposite effect. The target becomes immune to morale ef
fects, sleep effects, fatigue, exhaustion, ability drain, and energy drain, but gains none of the other advantages possessed by true undead.
\par 
\par If the target fails the Will save, their soul is altered such that they can truly be considered one of the undead. 
They can be turned or rebuked as normal, they are affected by spells that target the undead, and upon dying their soul is destroyed and cannot be restored by }{\i\f30\fs20 raise dead }{\f30\fs20 or }{\i\f30\fs20 reincarnate}{\f30\fs20

\f30\fs20  sites tend to morph and grow over time as the plane\rquote s energy collects in the region. Such domains are highly sought after and often fought over, for they provide several valuable effects to those who share traits with the plane.
\par 
\par First, spells and spell-like effects that share an alignment or energy trait with the plane gain a +2 bonus to their DC and are cast at +2 caster level. Furthermore, all attacks are considered aligned based on the pla
ne for purposes of bypassing damage reduction. For example, within an }{\i\f30\fs20 exalted}{\f30\fs20 
 site in Ysgard all attacks would be considered chaotic and good against creatures vulnerable to those alignments, while chaotic and good spells would gain a +2 bonus to their DC and be cast at +2 caster level.
\par 
\par Secondly, you may decide to intensify any of the plane\rquote s special features within the }{\i\f30\fs20 exalted}{\f30\fs20 
 site. This makes effects such as the impassioning nature of Arborea or the winds of Pandemonium ever stronger, and adds a +4 bonus to the DCs of any saves to resist the effects. You can also create permanent localized magical or weather effects appropria
t
e to the region. For instance, you could summon a violent blizzard that never abates on the frozen wasteland of Jotunheim in Ysgard, while on Acheron you could make the area seem an ideal battleground, drawing armies to a hotspot of war for no reason othe
r than it amplifies the plane\rquote s violent characteristics. Players are encouraged to come up with their own implementations, though each }{\i\f30\fs20 exalted}{\f30\fs20  site should only have one enhanced feature and shouldn\rquote 
t provide more than a minor bonus, if any.
\par 
\par Finally, creatures that linger in the area gradually take on the philosophy of the plane, temporarily moving one alignment step closer to that of the plane every hour until they leave the }{\i\f30\fs20 exalted}{\f30\fs20 
 site. Individuals may begin to act out personality characteristics attributed to the plane within minutes; an }{\i\f30\fs20 exalted}{\f30\fs20 
 site on Carceri should make people paranoid and treacherous, while one on Arcadia may cause people to seek perfection and harmony in everything they do. The exact effects are up to the DM and should be role-played.

 which they dwell. This spell allows you to merge your mind and soul with the current plane in order to seek secrets or enlightenment, though at great risk. At its most basic level, }{\i\f30\fs20 planar union}{\f30\fs20 
 provides answers to four types of questions. You can learn where someone or something is on the plane, or get a sense of what\rquote 
s happening at a specific location. It can provide you with knowledge of how to reach a destination on a plane. It also allows you to speak with echoes of petitioners and exemplar that have m
erged with the plane. Finally, the spell may reveal how the plane (and the forces it represents) it perceives a situation or what it desires from it. You may ask multiple questions, but each question beyond the first requires an extra hour of concentratio
n, but you do not need to pay any additional experience cost (see below).
\par 
\par Though everyone experiences this connection differently, in many ways it is like seeking insight from a hurricane. Any response comes not in words, but as symbols and impressions tha
t speak of things much grander, and which could easily overwhelm the most stalwart mind. On the other hand, a plane knows virtually anything related to its domains and unlike when consulting exemplars and deities there is virtually no chance that answers 
y
ou receive are tailored to some ulterior end. Bear in mind that such absolute forces do not perceive the affairs of finite creatures as we do, and that morality and ethics may very well be considered straightforward and objective when from a mortal perspe
ctive they are anything but.
\par 
\par While you can learn much by skimming the surface as it were, true enlightenment is found deeper, where even the planes begin to touch something bigger. There may be nothing th
at cannot be discovered by those willing to risk the journey, whether of past or future, mortal or god, practical or philosophical. You can ask virtually any question and expect an answer, though not necessarily in terms you comprehend and what you do gle
an is still filtered through the perspective of the forces comprising the plane. 
\par 
\par This requires the same amount of time, but delving so deeply into such primordial forces is not without its consequences. Caster\rquote s returning from such a sojourn may loss some
 of their sanity, develop strange illnesses, or even experience changes in alignment or beliefs. Particularly valuable or dangerous questions may result in the caster disappearing for days or weeks only to reappear in different parts of the plane later, n
ot necessarily remembering all that transpired. A few may fall into a stasis for extended periods of time, unable to be roused prematurely by anything but the most powerful magic. 
\par 
\par The exact effects are up to the DM and should be appropriate to the informa
tion the caster seeks; this spell serves as a doorway to truths otherwise unattainable but is by no means the easy route. For example, legend has it that one priest of great power sought the origins of the multiverse itself through use of }{\i\f30\fs20

y to fall into a death-like coma from which he has not awoken. Though five centuries has passed, a sect within the Fraternity of Order maintains vigilance over his torpid form in anticipation of the day he rises with an answer even the gods might not have

\par }{\i\f30\fs20 
\par Ooze}{\f30\fs20 
: Transformed from earth or water. This creates a patch of slimy muck which is equivalent to a deep bog for purposes of movement, cover, and penalties to skill checks. Creatures at the edge of the targeted area can make a Reflex save to avoid sinking into
 the mire.
\par }{\i\f30\fs20

for three rounds after exposure. Creatures at the edge of the targeted area can make a Reflex save to move onto safe ground.

While not as common as magic, psionics are nevertheless prevalent across the planes. With well known races such as the githyanki, githzerai, and yuan-ti traveling across the multiv
erse, and even the lesser known duegar, nathri, and thri-kreen making their mark, there are sizable number of naturally psionic races throughout the Great Ring. The most infamous masters of psionics, the illithid (better known as mind flayers among primes
), terrorized the Astral and Outer Planes long before they descended in any great number to the Prime Material Plane. One of their gods has longed resided within the bowels of the Outlands, and the loathsome creatures travel through Sigil on occasion.

\par 
\par As a whole, practitioners of psionics are held with a little bit of awe, as it\rquote 
s believed their power comes just a bit closer to controlling the fabric of the multiverse itself in the same manner as belief. This is only further substantiated by the number of psions within factions such as the Mind\rquote 
s Eye and the Fraternity of Order, which both expose their own ideas on mastering all of reality, as well as the Transcendent Order, which claims to be closer to the multiverse than anyone. Perhaps because of its diff
iculty channeling aligned energy, psionics are most common on the Outlands and the Astral Plane, as well as the stranger Region of Dreams and Far Plane. On the other hand, there are considerably less psionic creatures on the Ethereal and Inner Planes, lik
ely because of the lack of access to astral ectoplasm and the training required to manipulate ethereal protomatter instead.
\par 
\par The }{\i\f30\fs20 Planescape Campaign Setting}{\f30\fs20  treats psionics as the same as magic, though this isn\rquote

When used upon a sleeping individual this power allows you to enter a trance and project your mind into the dreamscape of the target. While your perceptions of time and space are heavily disto
rted within the Plane of Dreams, minds are often at their most vulnerable in their dreams and are highly suggestible. Simple statements are often interpreted as true and can shift the course of a dream, taking you and the target through corridors of memor
ies or bringing guarded secrets and emotions to the surface.
\par 
\par Furthermore, with enough time and persuasion you may implant thoughts into the creature\rquote s subconscious, changing the way it looks and conceives of things. For instance, you could implant feelings
 of suspicion in the target towards one of their companions or give the idea of traveling to a particular place to see the sites. The more subtle the suggestions the more likely they are to manifest when the creature wakes up, whereas thoughts that it fin
ds nonsensical or completely contrary to what it believes are bound to be forgotten or ignored. You must make a successful Charisma check opposed by the target\rquote 
s Wisdom check in order to implant suggestions. The creature receives a +5 bonus to its check if the suggestions contradict what it knows and believes.
\par 
\par The target does not initially realize that anything is different about its dream but pushing too strongly, either by trying to influence the dream repeatedly over a couple minutes or fighting the dream\rquote 
s progression, will eventually rouse the creature enough to be aware that it is dreaming and that something is wrong. When someone has realized that they are dreaming their control over the dream is nearly absolute, though they mind remains somewhat mudd
led.
\par 
\par You are unaware of your own surroundings or of the activities around you while in the trance. While physically defenseless, any sort of disturbance, such as a loud noise or being targeted by a power, breaks you from the trance and ends the power. Cre
atures who don\rquote t sleep or dream, or are somehow isolated from the Plane of Dreams, are immune to this power.
