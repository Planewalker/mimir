The man sat at his desk, a pile of scrolls to one side illuminated by the flickering amber glow of candles. Slowly and deliberately, he dipped a quill into a small inkbottle and b
egan to write. At first there was only gibberish, but soon words began to form themselves as he scratched more ink across the parchment, words that held meaning to few but himself. They came to him in a torrent of information that he struggled to pluck se
n
se from, but from the chaos that spilled into his skull from unseen sources he crafted reason and purpose. Names, places, events, possibilities. Meaning took shape in the splatters of ink, growing more defined and more deliberate as he reached the end of 
the page. With a scatter of sand and a cantrip, the ink was dried, allowing him to place it atop the stack of the others. Three more and he would glean some sense from the day\rquote 
s work and the coming potential of the next few weeks. Decisions would be made and he would task others to the goals he formulated. Sense and purpose would come of it all.
\par 
\par His solace was interrupted then by a series of hesitant knocks upon the door. He\rquote d already placed down his pen and waited for the intrusion patiently, knowing it would come before it happened as with so many other things. 
\par 
\par  \'93Enter Sarifel, I\rquote ve been expecting you.\'94 The candle flames danced in a gust of warm wind as the door to his cha
mber slid open and a waiflike tiefling entered. Out of some nervous habit Sarifel brushed a strand of brown hair away from his olive-toned forehead, replacing it behind the thin, curling ram horns that grew back from his skull. He paused and waited for th
e man behind the desk to address him. \'93Considering your time on this errand was spent within Sigil I have little insight into how your progress went. It remains dark, even to me. Tell me. Did you do as I requested?\'94
 His face remained an unreadable mask as he crossed his hands and waited for a response.
\par 
\par \'93It went well. The information was sold for a pretty piece of jink and I managed to drop it into the ears of a few other berks who\rquote ll do their own thing with it as well.\'94
\par 
\par  \'93Does the arcanaloth suspect you?\'94 
There was a weight placed upon the question, for the first time showing some vague irritation behind those brilliant green eyes that seemed to look through his servitor like he was a glass case in a shop, spilling his secret contents out into the open.

\par 
\par  \'93No\'85at least I don\rquote t think so. As hounded for details as I was, I said what you told me to say, nothing more, nothing less. It seemed to have worked, though I didn\rquote t get as much as my initial asking price. The jackal talked me down.
\'94
\par 
\par  \'93The jink is meaningless. The \lquote loth has more where that came from I would assume. More than we do, but that\rquote s unimportant when we trade in secrets and things of belief.\'94
 He gave a knowing smile, but an approving one cast towards the tiefling. \'93I have another task for you, a package to deliver to another of the select, this time within Limbo. But I\rquote 
ll have the details given to you later. For the moment you deserve some rest. You\rquote ve done well, Sarifel.\'94
\par 
\par The tiefling smiled with renewed pride, \'93I\rquote m glad you approve. As before I\rquote ll write down everything that happened and have it in your hands by the morning.\'94
 He turned to leave, only muttering to himself after the door had closed heavily behind him, \'93Not that you likely won\rquote t already know everything before I\rquote ve written it down. Dam
ned if I can tumble to how you snatch it out of my mind, or out of thin air.\'94
\par 
\par Back inside the room, the tiefling\rquote s footsteps growing distant now and receding down the hallway, the man smiled darkly. \'93Indeed, and not that you even have a clue yourself to what it is you\rquote 
ve been doing. Secrets are like that my friend; they hide themselves behind dark little veils of obscurity or, far too often, our own unwillingness to face their reality. Follow that same self-deception and it turns to disbelief, and then see
 where that gets you. Look if you have but eyes to look and ears to listen. But you don\rquote t, and that\rquote s why you follow me. When you and they finally do open your eyes, by then you may wish you hadn\rquote 
t. But now I only have need to watch the effects of your actions on my behalf. I do think I\rquote ll be pleased.\'94

\par Greetings cutter and allow me to further introduce myself on these pages stained with ink and effort, blood and betrayal, and my own honest toil. In the event that this work is sepa
rated from its companion volumes of lore and darks, advice and wit, allow me to preface these pages that bare the mark of my pen once more. To those of you who have made my acquaintance before, well met again, and for those of you fresh to my words, greet
ings. I\rquote ve written a good number of things in my past, foremost among them the Factol\rquote s Manifesto. And indeed, that volume earned me a death sentence from the Mercykillers.
\par 
\par But here I am, still alive, the Red Death split in twain and my sentence forgotten. Who then has had the last laugh on the matter I ask?
\par 
\par My purpose for that volume was the same as my purpose now and forever more: The objective dissemination of the truth. Undeniably, many of you will doubt my words as fully accurate, or suspect it of hav
ing some underpinnings of falsehood or slander, seeking to manipulate events and opinions. But I assure you that is not the case. I exist outside the games of politics, personalities and creeds within the City of Doors, now and forever more. Take me as yo
ur personal guide to the storied places, persons and legends of Sigil.
\par 
\par Herein this volume, unchecked by censor or judge, lays the everyday knowledge of The Cage as well as some deeper tales known heretofore only by graybeards and those golden lords and kni
ghts of the post who prowl the gutters of the city, both gilded and foul. Her Dread Majesty indeed may perhaps sanction my work, as she has done me no harm in my efforts thus far.
\par 
\par Newly arrived as one of the clueless to the City of Doors? Then read well a
nd learn of the city you find yourself within. My words might save your life, or lead to some foolishly squandering theirs. Call the city kip already? Still, you might find a thing or two within new to you in all your self-professed knowledge of The Cage 
and its inhabitants. 
\par 
\par Do what you will with the information penned upon these pages; my goal is simply to state the facts unsullied by those who would twist the truth to their own ends.
 My words before have always rung true. Find fault in me there if you can, for here do they ring true once more. Learn well from me. As always, your servant of the truth. \endash  The Editor.

\par Stepping into Sigil, regardless of which ward you enter, is always a unique, and not always an altogether pleasant experience. Be that as it may, it is always remarkable and not easily forgotten. The first thing you\rquote 
ll probably notice is the sting in your eyes as you cough, and maybe strugg
le for your first breath of the thin, soot-laden air mixed with the sounds and smells of a thousand worlds, planes, and their inhabitants. And then you start to marvel at the place despite the dense blanket of haze that hovers like fog, mixed with the low
 hanging clouds that form the city\rquote s own weather. In a word: Sigil can be utterly dreary at the same time it amazes and confounds.
\par 
\par That nearly constant haze and high hanging fog very well constitutes the average weather of Sigil. While the city isn\rquote t truly
 large enough to create its own weather patterns, a presumed number of portals exist that link it to the Elemental Plane of Air, as well as the Paraelemental Plane of Steam, and perhaps even the Quasielemental Planes of Lightning and Smoke. All of this, i
n combination with the influx of air from all other portals in the city, and the combined cooking fires, exhalations of the residents, and any other similar things combine to form the unique atmosphere of the City of Doors. It isn\rquote 
t exactly pretty berk, even by a fiend\rquote s ideals. While the air in The Lady\rquote 
s Ward might be a bit clearer most days, down towards the Lower Ward the exhaust and smoke from the Great Foundry and all the other myriad workshops and forges combine to form a yellowish, sickening blanket 
of smog over the city that spreads out to the other wards. 
\par 
\par Now if this all kept up, eventually the air in the city would be unbreathable, or so the graybeards say. Every so often when the smog seems like it can\rquote t get any worse, it all improves in the spa
ce of a day; the air seems cleaner, a blood can see further up into the \'93sky\'94
, and the ring opposite seems much more detailed than before. At these intervals the air is downright pleasant to breathe too. Not that it lasts all that long, but the chant is th
at either winds blowing up off the Spire purge Sigil of its worst smog, or the Lady opens the portals in such a fashion as to flush the air and replenish it anew when needed.
\par 
\par But I\rquote ve gone down quite a tangent, and forgotten the scene at hand. Past the mi
ldly acidic drizzle from overhead on most every other day, you can stand and gawk at both deva and fiend conversing with one another as they stride past you on the wide cobblestone street between two high eaved buildings. Glancing at the surrounding struc
t
ures themselves, you will notice the blades and ornate spikes that might decorate the surrounding walls and terraces from which ravens and pigeons, among more exotic beasts, might roost or lie skewered. As you walk you might be jostled by a passing bariau
r, or a human and a golden skinned aasimar speaking at length, and then notice that the buildings, regardless of grandeur or condition, all tend to bear a unique and common style.
\par 
\par You see, Sigil\rquote s buildings, from its most glorious and gilded structures of the wealthy and powerful to the rotting ramshackle shanties of its slums, all have a distinct style and appearance in common. Several features typify Sigil\rquote 
s architectural tradition: blades, spiked fences, iron and stone ornamentation, and razorvine. Of th
ese features, the first three have practical uses for the buildings they decorate, while the last is a widespread nuisance that is dealt with and has accommodated some function only in order to put a positive spin on the hellish vegetation. While some of 
the racial enclaves and ghettos may deviate from this typical architectural style, a building from Sigil is recognizable and distinct from most anywhere else on the planes.
\par 
\par Blades sprout from many of the buildings in Sigil, rising up as razor-edged fingers to glimmer in the hazy light. These ornaments likely originate in imitation of, and deference to the blades of Sigil\rquote 
s enigmatic ruler and protector, Her Dread Majesty, the Lady of Pain. But besides this likely origin, the blades are just as much for protection against thieves and intruders.
\par 
\par The spiked fences common to most of the larger buildings in Sigil, and to a lesser extent the smaller and less cared for buildings of the poorer wards of the city, have both a decorative function as well as practical 
ones for the buildings they grace. Thieves find their grips and potential handholds topped by spikes, and windows and shutters girded with iron. The spikes also deter some of Sigil\rquote s indigenous birds such as executioner\rquote 
s ravens and some types of grayish green pigeons from roosting atop a berk\rquote s kip. [To say nothing of mephits\'85 - The Editor]
\par 
\par Ornamentation in the form of either abstract designs or carved imitations of perched figures and gargoyles in both iron and worked stone is common. The more prominent 
the building or the more wealthy the occupant, the more elaborate the ornamentation. Decorative waterspouts, eaves and gables are common in the more wealthy areas of Sigil, but are not restricted to them. Iron and stone are the most common building materi
al used because they can be created through magic, rather than imported at great expense by way of Sigil\rquote 
s portals. However, in the richer wards of the Cage, special and unique varieties of stone, metal and wood have been imported from places ranging from M
ount Celestia, to Gehenna, to the Quasielemental Plane of Mineral. But most commonly used as building materials across all of Sigil are varieties of simple grayish or white stone, iron, slate, and rough-hewn wood.

\par }{\f30\fs20 As you\rquote re examining the city\rquote s architecture, you\rquote 
re bound to find a wall or two covered and overgrown by a creep hedge or carpet of twisting, but oddly fitting black vine snaking up the stone. Mind your hands, lest you draw back and find your fingers lacerated and dripping blood upon th
e vines, yourself, and the cobblestones under your feet.
\par 
\par Razorvine, considered a blight upon the planes by many, is a dark, nearly black twisting vine that infests parts of Sigil and proves nearly impossible to completely kill. The thin, twisting vines ar
e dotted with dense clusters of heart shaped leaves, which grow atop thin, triangular stems that are themselves as sharp as razors. It can grow several feet a day, and the twists and knots of the vine make it near impossible to find the roots.
\par 
\par This inability to purge the Cage of the vine is certainly not for any lack of trying on the behalf of many of Sigil\rquote 
s citizens. The vine is routinely hacked down, trimmed, poisoned, and burnt in an effort to kill it, or more commonly to keep its rampant growth under 
control. Razorvine is likely of Abyssal origin, possibly having been imported from the gate-town of Plague-Mort, though there is little proof to support this claim. Sigil\rquote 
s residents have adapted to using it as both a decoration and a security device on the walls and roofs of buildings. Grown up and into elegant latticework on the sides of a cutter\rquote 
s kip, the razor-edged plant will prevent most any thief from daring to scale the wall. A single fall could eviscerate even the hardiest knight of the post.
\par 
\par Finally, the vine itself can be used as cheap sustenance for certain grazing animals, and bundles of the dried, trimmed vine are sold as such both inside and outside of Sigil. When properly prepared, razorvine can also be used as a source of fuel for wood
 burning stoves and fireplaces. Faced with their inability to rid themselves of the creeping plague, Sigil has sought to profit from the plant as best it can.

\par Everyone seems to take at face value the chant that Sigil sits atop the great Spire in the exact center of the Outlands. This\rquote d place Sigil at arguably the very center of the Outer Planes, and, by some cutters\rquote 
 reckoning, the center of the multiverse. Any resident of Sigil however will dismiss this notion as pure screed, despite its attractiveness. Nothing is at the center of everything. Ask any planewalker and they\rquote ll tell you the same: that it\rquote 
s the rule of the Center of All showing through. Every point in the multiverse sits in the midst of a sea of everything, infinite and vast. From that perspective, every point is the same and at the center of everything as far as it\rquote s concerned. It
\rquote s just the fact that Sigil\rquote s portals connect it to every plane of existence that leads to the mistaken idea that it sits at the center of everything.
\par 
\par Of 
course, some even question the assumption that it sits atop the Spire in the first place. Thing is, the Spire is supposedly infinitely tall. So how then can there be a top of the Spire for something to be placed at? [Indeed, Sigil is a mystery among myste

Getting to and from Sigil is at the same time both simple and complex. The lowliest prime can slip into and out of the city with but the Lady\rquote s whimsy and the right key, wh
ile the gods themselves are barred from entering no matter how long they rage in impotence at doorways forever sealed to them. There\rquote 
s something poetic about the reality of Sigil, with so many things stark and definite, but coexisting with the enigmatic and unknown. 
\par 
\par That said; Sigil\rquote s hallmark is the nigh unco
untable portals that are the reason behind its name, the City of Doors. A door, a window, a flagstone, a tracing of cracks in a stone wall, a painted circle left by a barmy Xaositect on the side of a tree. All of these are bounded spaces, and all of them 
p
otentially portals. Any bound space within Sigil has the potential to be a portal to effectively anywhere in existence from the Outer to Inner planes, the Prime, even demiplanes hidden throughout the multiverse. All that matters is having the correct key.

\par 
\par A portal key can be anything. A leaf from a cutting of razorvine, a golden ring, a silver rose dipped in blood. All of these could be portals keys. And indeed a portal key need not be material. It could be a certain song hummed while walking backwards thr
ough the bound space, or even a thought in passing while crossing the portal\rquote s threshold. At the will of Her Serenity, all of these could be the keys to activating any of Sigil\rquote s portals.
\par }\pard\plain \ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0\itap0 \fs24\lang1033\langfe1033\cgrid\langnp1033\langfenp1033 {\f30\fs20 
\par Indeed, the portals of Sigil are the only way in or out. Without the knowledge of the proper portal, and the proper key to that portal, a body can\rquote 
t enter or exit Sigil. There is no other way to enter or leave the city, though some have attempted to do so by leaping from Sigil\rquote s ring in the spot called \lquote Suicide Alley\rquote  whe
re the outer wall is low enough to climb over. What happens to those is dark; none have ever been proven to return. If Sigil sits atop the infinite Spire, one might simply fall for infinity after jumping clear from the ring to eventually die of starvation
 
or thirst. Some have even suggested that the poor sods might be thrown to a random plane, but again this is unproven. Curious? Try to look over the walls and see what lies beyond. Some have done so, especially those cutters who have the ability to fly, an
d they see neither the Spire, nor even a void. }{\i\f30\fs20 Nothingness}{\f30\fs20 . Try as they might, those who\rquote ve seen over Sigil\rquote 
s walls say only that nothing lies beyond them, and leave it at that, words failing to fully describe the concept. The multiverse has its mysteries, and Sigil lies at the heart of many of them.
\par 
\par The portals of Sigil have an even more unique, and humbling feature. The powers may not enter Sigil. Powers, deities, gods, whatever your name for them, they are barred from entering the City of Doors. Rage tho
ugh they might to take the gateway to the planes, they may not so much as step a foot through a portal into Sigil. Of everything on the planes, little may be held as a true constant save this: Gods may not enter Sigil. Perhaps this is a byproduct of Sigil
\rquote s location atop the spire, or its place at the so-called center of the planes, but most graybeards acknowledge but one answer to this dark: Her Serenity, the Lady of Pain.
\par 
\par There is no way around the limitations imposed upon Sigil, though many have tried. 
Sigil is coexistent upon the Astral Plane, though planewalkers upon the Astral have said that the city is surrounded by a palely luminescent, and utterly impenetrable bubble that sears the mind and defies proper explanation. This astral barrier wholly pre
vents passage into Sigil through the Astral Plane, leaving only the Lady\rquote s portals as viable entry. Still, the city isn\rquote t so much separated as, well, }{\i\f30\fs20 caged}{\f30\fs20 
 off from the Astral. Spells and even psionics that work by connecting to that plane do work within Sigil. It\rquote s just impossible to enter or exit the city, or even observe anything but its mysterious shielded boundary by means of the Silver Void.

\par 
\par Other spells such as summoning and similar conjuration magic fail spectacularly within Sigil, although some wizards are said to know of spots within the city where by chance, or more likely the Lady\rquote s will, such spells do work, within limitation. }
{\i\f30\fs20 Plane shift}{\f30\fs20  spells fail, though teleportation works within the confines of the city. Again such spells work, but nothing may cross into or out of the city, except by way of the portals. Even such powerful spells as }{\i\f30\fs20 
gate}{\f30\fs20  and }{\i\f30\fs20 wish}{\f30\fs20  fail to breach the limitations imposed upon Sigil. Indeed, if even the powers cannot breach the wards set around the City of Doors, what hope does mortal magic hold to accomplish the same?
\par 
\par Some say that the portals of Sigil appear at the whimsy of the Lady, others that they are all random and She only controls the keys to open them. Others still say that nothing is random and indeed, She creates Her
 portals not at whimsy but with deft, measured strokes of will. As with most things regarding the Bladed Queen, the matter remains dark. But what is known is that the Lady of Pain has the ability to shut down the portals of the city, even all of them at o
nce. She has done so before, and could do so again. And with that, mind this: the City of Doors has but so much air.

The City of Doors, being built along the inside of a great torus atop the Spire, has a rather unique shape. Indeed sta
nding upon any of the streets of the burg, given enough clear space to see for any decent stretch, one can see the city curving up and along the circumference of the ring. Looking up at night, when a basher can see through the perpetual haze, you can see 
the twinkling lamps, fires and other lights from the streets and buildings clear across the ring on the other side of the city. One big ring sitting at the very center of }{\f30\fs20\ul the}{\f30\fs20 
 Great Wheel of the Outer Planes. Coincidence, or the Unity of Rings shining through? Let graybeards ponder over that question. Allow the clueless to stare and wonder. The rest of us just accept it and live out our days without giving it much thought.

\par 
\par Shape aside, the size of Sigil, from one end to the other, as determined in the past b
y Harmonium and Guvner surveys, places the Cage at roughly five miles across, and twenty miles in circumference. However, these are simply approximations and an average of the myriad values they found. See, the actual size of Sigil is not set to any value
.
 The Lady can alter the size of the City of Doors at Her whim, making it larger or smaller for whatever mysterious reasons and purposes She has. Likely if the population of Sigil exceeded a certain amount Her Serenity might simply allow the city to grow i
n size to accommodate these changes, with her servants, the dabus, creating new buildings and paving new streets.
\par 
\par Another artifact of the unique ring shape of Sigil is that, like most planes, there\rquote s no easy way to orient yourself for directions. There\rquote s n
o north and south, no east or west. All directions end up being relative to specific points in the city and to the Spire (not that it can be seen from within Sigil, but it\rquote 
s assumed to be there, somewhere). In this manner, you give direction by which wards to pass through or go towards. For instance, to get to the Gatehouse from the Lower Ward, you would travel to the Hive. With the ring \'93laying on its side\'94
 above the Spire, there also exist up and down, commonly known as spireward and downward, corresponding o up and down respectively, which govern direction to the edges of the city.
\par 
\par Modrons and certain lawful cutters, such as the former members of the Fraternity of Order, break from this system of relative direction and favor a system of radial and chord wise coordinates. Most bloods don\rquote 
t tend to bother with this exact system, favoring the more common, and while less exact, easier to use methods of giving directions relative to the wards and the spire.

es by which to tell the time. Yet there still exists something akin to day and night in the burg. Here it\rquote 
s called peak and antipeak, for the times when the dim, hazy light that seems to spring out of the very air above the ring of Sigil is waxing or waning to its highest or lowest points. That said it\rquote 
s never truly bright in the city save for the hours surrounding peak. Otherwise, it\rquote s usually a subdued glow of early morning or growing twilight, filtering through the haze, or, during the hours around antipe
ak, when the sky is a more or less an artificial night. And although Sigil has no sun or moon or stars, being that the city is ring shaped, during the hours around antipeak, a cutter looking up can see the faint twinkle and glimmer of lights on the street
s and in buildings clear opposite of them on the other side of Sigil. Well, when the air is suitably clear of fog or haze anyways.

\par The roll of years is something of a mixed bag in Sigil and frequently comes to confuse the clueless and graybeard alike. For 
while Sigil is, or is presumed to be, eternal in every sense of the word, written records of history in the City of Doors are hard to come by the further back one looks. Without accurate and longstanding historical records there exists nothing by which to
 
judge the flow of time, or by which to date against. The latest convention for keeping track of the years has been, until recent history, giving the date by the number of the year of the current factol of the Fraternity of Order. With the assassination of
 
Factol Hashkar, and the flight of the Guvners from Sigil after the Faction War, there has been no standard convention in place for the roll of years since then. In common usage until recently have been to label the years since then as the 5th year of the 
Faction War, the 5th year of the Factions\rquote 
 Fall, and the 5th year of the Liberated Sigil. While still not official, the most commonly used method, now increasingly seen in documents relating to city business, is to label the years relative to the Lady\rquote s edi
ct banishing the factions. Thus a year would be described as the 5th year of the Lady\rquote s Edict.
\par 
\par Debate is currently ongoing within the Sigil Advisory Council that would establish an official convention for the roll of years as a standard, but with other my
riad issues facing them it is unlikely to be pushed to the forefront of debate. For now the unofficial official convention works as well as any other.

branches of the prime races abound and form the majority of the population of Sigil. The planetouched races are represented largely by aasimar and tieflings within the City of Doors. While there also exists a smaller and visible amount of the various gena
si races, any of the more exotic planetouched races are a small minority collectively. Also of note is the fact that the Outer Planar races vastly outnumber the natives of the Inner Planes, despite Sigil\rquote s portals to every plane in the multiverse. 

\par 
\par From wa
rd to ward, the population of the City of Doors varies with respect to composition by both planars or primes, as well as the types of bashers that populate the ward. Many of the more exotic races, and those who have been historically more insular, persecu
t
ed within Sigil, or across the planes in general, tend to accumulate among themselves in their own racially distinct neighborhoods. Indeed, a number of racial enclaves across Sigil have grown large enough to merit distinction as districts of their own wit
hin a given ward.
\par 
\par The Lady\rquote s Ward is nearly free of the fiendish races, and relatively few tieflings grace its streets or call the ward kip except for the touts of the city, which number many tieflings among their number. Humans, half-elves, various genasi
 (particularly air genasi, who appreciate the cleaner air of the ward), aasimar, zenythri, and bariaur make up the stock of the ward in number from largest to smallest. The powerful and the opportunistic reside in this ward alongside the honest and the up
standing. By crime or by the law, a blood may find themself fleeced of his jink one way or the other if they\rquote 
re not careful within the ward. Alongside the crosstrade, the wealthy, and the knights of the post are the various members of the clergy. They abound in The Lady\rquote 
s Ward in numbers larger than in any other section of the city, with even the occasional divine proxy traversing the wide avenues.
\par 
\par Within the Lower Ward a cutter will find the most diverse collection of racial types within Sigil, though true
 to its name, the number of portals to the Lower Planar tends to skew this mix of races towards a more fiendish bent. Regardless, humans are the largest group, followed almost equally by tieflings, githzerai, and bariaur. Less numerous, but still represen
t
ed in numbers one cannot dismiss, are elves, dwarves, gnomes, half-elves, and rogue modron. Indeed, the Lower Ward, unbeknownst to many, was ages ago called the Prime Ward, for the ghettos of the Clueless herded and sequestered there. [An idea which Ciril
y of the Sigil Advisory Council would likely find attractive once again. \endash 
 The Editor] And here, within the racially diverse atmosphere of the ward, most bashers tend towards common labor, most of them having little training in sorcery or swordplay. Forge w
orkers, pot menders, and tailors have little use for such crafts. More often than not the populace trends more to mundane means than in most wards.
\par 
\par In the Hive, the poorest and most crime-ridden ward of all of Sigil, the racial mix becomes much different 
from the other wards. Humans are hardly the most common race, and are a considerable minority when compared with the number of tieflings, githzerai, chaonds, bariaur, half-elves, monstrous humanoids, giant-kin, and full-blown fiends. Celestials and aasima
r are virtually a rarity within the ward, for good reason with the number of fiends and bashers of a criminal nature.

\par Within the utter squalor of the Hive, the masses of living detritus tend towards little to no education, and so the educated and the rich 
tend to be a rarity in most areas, except for those few who have moved into the ward either to exploit, employ, or preach to the population. Some berks find that they can make a name for themselves with their skill or magical prowess in the ward\rquote 
s criminal
 circles. The unorganized, or organized and less powerful, criminal elements of Sigil reside in the Hive. Here thievery can allow even a relatively unskilled leatherhead to make quite a living for themselves inside the ward, or to venture outside, make th
eir jink, and then flee back to avoid the rule of law outside the Hive.
\par 
\par The Clerk\rquote s Ward, home of the bureaucracy that daily greases the wheels of Sigil\rquote s government, tends to be rather drab when compared to the other wards of Sigil. Its citizens comprise 
a population made up largely of humans, with smaller numbers of githzerai, tieflings, zenythri, bariaur, dwarves and halflings. Most exemplars tend to avoid the ward for whatever reason, maybe considering the mundane lot of little importance in their sche
mes.
\par 
\par The citizens of the Clerk\rquote s Ward tend to be a bit higher educated than in many of the other wards, with more skill using a pen than a sword for many. However, that\rquote s not to say that the unskilled have no use in the ward. They simply won
\rquote t have any chance of gaining much influence, but they can, and do manage to make a living serving as guards, servants, and laborers. 
\par 
\par The Guildhall Ward stands in marked contrast to the Lower Ward, but also in startling similarity in terms of racial complexion. While t
he ward is just as diverse as the Lower Ward, the population tends towards a mirror opposite of it, with the fiends and fiend-touched races replaced by celestials and aasimar; and here, even more so than in the Clerk\rquote 
s Ward, a large number of spellslingers and magical artisans call the ward kip. 
\par 
\par The Market Ward is fairly diverse with regards to racial composition, though much of the diversity comes from the daily influx of buyers. After all, every cutter in Sigil has things they like or need to purchase, 
and the Great Bazaar of the Market Ward has the largest selection of merchants and vendors within all of Sigil. Among the merchants themselves, there\rquote 
s more than a fair share of bariaur and half-elves along with the human population. Here, fiends can be se
en passing by celestials on a daily basis, and none seem to give it much a second thought. Still, the occasional fight between passing Baatezu and Tanar\rquote ri makes way for an opening in any crowd within the ward.
\par 
\par Most cutters of any 
background can find a use for themselves within the ward, be it for the security of the merchants, creation of items, preaching to the crowds in the Bazaar, or bobbing some sod for his coin. The ward takes all kinds and passes little judgment upon them. T
his facet of daily life remains one of the most lingering influences of the Free League. [Though admittedly they never officially existed as a faction, so it\rquote s unfair to say that they no longer exist with the Lady\rquote s Edict in place. They
\rquote re still here with the same faces and the same social and business circles, but no longer by the same name in public. \endash  The Editor]

\par Sigil, as with any other city of its size and population, has a wide variety of services hawked by those canny bloods 
with skills, ranging from the common to rare, and abilities, ranging from unskilled to masters of their craft. From the portals come flooding into the burg a vast diversity of products, wares, and raw goods from all corners of the planes. From street corn
er vendors\rquote  carts, to shops, to whatever a berk can hold in his hands, the wares of commerce are to be had by those with the jink for it, or the quickness to bob it off those who do.
\par 
\par Most of the business within Sigil, or at least the vast bulk of it, takes place within the Great Bazaar inside the appropriately named Market Ward. Of course, to find something within the ward isn\rquote 
t always quite so easy. One must consider the size of the area it occupies and that most of the shops are pitched upon the ground in
 a haphazardly manner and may change position slightly depending on the circumstances and the goods they sell. [Illegal goods move fast, in every sense of the word. \endash 
 The Editor] Most products sold in the Market Ward are on the up and up, though other areas such as the Night Market within the Hive sell to customers unconcerned with prior ownership or price.
\par 
\par Other shops are dotted throughout Sigil, in each and every ward, with the wards in turn giving a bit of flavor to each shop, and the shops themselves g
iving something back to their districts. Poignant examples that serve to exemplify this range from the Friendly Fiend in the Lower Ward, Parts & Pieces in the Market Ward [With the ever so added benefit of being run by Seamusxanthuszenus, Slayer of Fiends
 and Merchant Most Excellent! Aka \lquote That Mephit with the Hat\rquote . (N male dust mephit). Need I say more? \endash  The Editor], Tivvum\rquote s Antiquities in the Market Ward, and Traban\rquote s Forge within The Lady\rquote 
s Ward. All of these shops have their own unique flavor that adds to, and derives itself from their ward of residence. Indeed, so do most of the small, independent merchants within Sigil to an extent.
\par 
\par But shops aside, all manner of services are available within the City of Doors, such as tours of the city available fro
m the Tout and Escorts guild, entertainment provided by the Civic Festhall and Entertainers Guild, and the location of desired portals provided by the members of the Doorsnoop\rquote s Guild. Since the fall of the factions, many of Sigil\rquote 
s guilds hold far more influence in the city, and consequently offer more services and benefits to their members than in the previous seven centuries of their existence.
\par 
\par Across the city, a blood can find sedan chair rides or Arcadian pony drawn carriages to ferry him over or thro
ugh the crowds, and young scaps called light boys carry glowing staves to light the way for a cutter walking in Sigil after dark. Life is much easier for those with jink to freely spend on their own luxury.
\par 
\par Magical items of all types and manufacture may b
e bought from the merchants or spell-slingers of the city. At the same time, arcane knowledge itself can be found in both the Great Library, the Sensory stones of the Civic Festhall, and smaller and more private groups like the Society of Luminiferous Aet
her.
\par 
\par And bub\'85 a hundred different alehouses, bub taps, and watering holes can be found across the breadth of the city. Each of them with their own unique atmosphere, clientele, and price range, to say nothing of other entertainment provided to the patrons.
 [The Fortunes Wheel in The Lady\rquote s Ward, and the Bottle and Jug in the Hive are perhaps the two most polar opposites in this regard, though under the surface they have much more in common than the patrons of the former are likely to admit. \endash

that, all of its inhabitants, not that She likely cares one way or another for anyone in the city. But any threats to Sigil itself or to Her own power and She reacts. During these select few times in Sigil\rquote

\par 
\par From time to time, She may randomly float down an avenue, passively observing before vanishing around a corner without a trace. Wise bloods look away and avert their eyes, or quickly find business elsewhere. She neve

\par }{\f30\fs20 
\par Long ago, before the Shattered Temple District gained its name and the Athar claimed the ruins as their own, the Shattered Temple was the High Temple of Aoskar. At its hei
ght, Aoskar claimed nearly half of the residents of the Cage as his worshippers, with many of them whispering a prayer to him before passing into or out of a portal to Sigil. In fact, eventually the worship of Aoskar become nearly synonymous with the City
 of Doors itself, and a time came when berks began to worship the Lady of Pain as an aspect of him.
\par 
\par Whatever his ultimate reasons, Aoskar\rquote s final offense to the Lady was when one of the dabus took up the robes of his priesthood and endorsed the worship of 
the Father of Portals, forsaking Her Serenity in doing so. That dabus, still alive and forsaken by his own kind, is known as Fell. None besides him and the Lady know the true dark of what exactly happened, save that the temple, and all within were obliter
a

\par 
\par The symbols and trappings of the faith of Aoskar have since then been considered anathema within Sigil, such was Her fury that day to not only kill a greater power but all of his mortal host as well. Such are the lengths that the Lady w

\par Speculation on the true nature of the Lady is rife among scholars, sages, and the common folks of Sigil alike. But answers are never forthcoming from any source. Still, the common chant, most likely a
ll screed without a shred of proof, holds a number of common myths. Some say that the Lady is a mortal who found Sigil and used it to grant Herself immeasurable power. Other rumors hold that She is a renegade, or risen, Tanar\rquote 
ri lord from the Abyss. Others say that she was hatched from a dabus egg [Whatever that is \endash 
 The Editor] by Io, the draconic overpower. A few even suggest She may simply be an illusion of the dabus themselves, or their queen, much like that among bees in a hive. Now dead sages, rumored
 mazed or flayed, have claimed that the Lady is not the ruler of Sigil, but its ultimate prisoner. After all, why else might Sigil be called the Cage? Some have compared the Lady to an overpower, or some unique, but nondivine being, so ancient as to defy 
mortal definitions. A being who exists to keep Sigil free of any and all divine influences, perhaps in an attempt to balance the planes themselves.
\par 
\par Of course, not a shred of proof exists to shed a light upon the mystery. And those who seek to delve too deeply into the Lady\rquote s secrets tend to vanish without a trace, gone, whisked away on the winds of oblivion.

\par The Lady of Pain is less an NPC than a setting mechanic. She transcends any game mechanic and has no stats.  Should She be directly challenged by PC\rquote s or NPC\rquote s, nothing they do should be capable of hitting or harming Her. Not a }{
\i\f30\fs20 wish}{\f30\fs20 , not a }{\i\f30\fs20 miracle}{\f30\fs20 , not even epic spells. Even the overpowers cannot defy the barriers preventing powers from entering the Cage (not that such beings
 tend to have interests beyond their sphere of influence anyways). Within Sigil, the Lady of Pain should be considered as close to all powerful as needed. That said, the Lady should not be overexposed or used outside of rare occasions lest She lose the my
stique and grandeur that surrounds Her, along with the unknown details of Her history and true connection to Sigil or indeed roll within the multiverse itself.
\par 
\par Those who challenge the Lady are mazed or flayed with no sympathy, malice, or quarter given by H
er Serenity. Those who harm Sigil or disrupt the life of the city in grand fashion will suffer the same fate, as will those who seek to delve too deeply into the secrets of the Lady (if they manage to escape insanity in their quest). Some things are beyon
d the scope of the PC\rquote 
s in the setting, and interacting with the Lady in all but the most rare and unique fashion should be avoided. At most, a character may see the Lady floating silently down a street in Sigil, or perhaps once in the course of a long and 
well-developed campaign a PC may witness a flaying or an edict given by the Lady to them or others. Such edicts should be reserved for campaign defining events with major ramifications within Sigil.
\par 
\par Considering all this, the Lady is not omnipotent (not completely, anyways). In terms of the metaplot, certain \'93weaknesses\'94
 have been exploited in the past, and the rare NPC has seemingly come close to gaining some victory over Her, only to ultimately fail (and sometimes with evidence such attempts were merely part of the Lady\rquote 
s design). In any case, the Lady should always remain above and beyond the ambitions of the PCs.

\par Commonly seen in most every part of Sigil, existing as the silent caretakers of the City of Doors and servants of the Lady of Pain are the dabus.\tab The dabus appear as humanoids of average height, robed and nearly indistinguishable from one ano
ther, with two sets of horns, one ram and one goat, sprouting from their foreheads just below a shock of upstanding white hair. It is nearly impossible to tell one dabus from another, and due to their physical similarity it remains impossible to estimate 
the true number of dabus that inhabit the city.
\par 
\par The dabus act as the caretakers of Sigil, floating, rather than walking above the streets in small groups to repair the roads, trim razorvine back from buildings, and keep the streets clean of debris and detr
itus. Of late, the dabus have also taken upon themselves the duties of magistrates within the City Courts in order to restore unbiased justice to Sigil, untainted by the suspect work of the magistrates formerly of the Fraternity of Order.
\par 
\par This recent act 
has also appeared to diminish the number of dabus observed upon the streets of Sigil, and led to the formation of the Sanitation Guild to pick up the duties formerly held solely by the dabus themselves. This has led some graybeards within Sigil to postula
te that there is a set number of Dabus in existence at any point in time. The answer remains dark.
\par 
\par Within Sigil, legend has always held that the dabus reside within hidden warrens deep beneath the city streets. However, none have ever observed the dabus en
tering these fabled retreats of theirs. At most, when dusk falls over the city the dabus have been seen floating down into openings to the Great Below, or simply turning corners and vanishing from the streets.
\par 
\par Perhaps the most defining, and the most perpl
exing, feature of the dabus is the peculiar manner of communication they possess. The dabus are mute, and while they can apparently listen to and understand any known method of communication, they possess neither audible nor telepathic modes of speech. Ra
t
her, the dabus project above their heads a string of illusory symbols and pictures that form words. The so-called dabus rebuses can be confusing and difficult to translate to those unfamiliar with their chosen method of speech, though the rebuses are alwa
ys phrased to translate into the favored language of whomever the dabus are speaking to. 
\par 
\par Those seeking aid in understanding the dabus might do well to purchase one of the many guidebooks to Rebus speech, commonly available across the city in bookshops or 
street vendors in the Market Ward. Most of the books are based off the groundbreaking work of the linguist Milori (CG female lilland Brd 2), a lilland who spends most of her time within Sigil speaking to newcomers and cataloging any language, or variant o
f a language, new to her. Based out of the Clerk\rquote s Ward, her swansong, }{\i\f30\fs20 The Dabus-Common Phrasebook, }{\f30\fs20 also known by its alternate name, }{\i\f30\fs20 The Dark Revealed,}{\f30\fs20 
 can be purchased or her services bought for the same purpose. [Milori\rquote s work is more reliable, if a bit more expensive, than most of the other books sold under similar names within Sigil. She\rquote 
s quite a pleasant person to hold company with as well, though I understand the dabus nearly as well as she, and thus have only had occasion to speak with her a scant few times. \endash  The Editor]
\par 
\par A dabus have never been observed outside of Sigil, and indeed it would seem that perhaps they are tied to the city in some way. When asked, the dabus have answered that they were born of Sigil itself. Whatever they mean by that, wh
en asked who they serve, they respond back with a single rebus: that of the bladed head of the Lady of Pain. No other answer is appropriate, or forthcoming. Additionally, some graybeards have speculated that there may exist some link between the dabus, an
d
 the phirblas, denizens of their own ethereal demiplanes who bare distinct resemblances to the dabus in some of their modes of speech, society, and appearance. But the links are tenuous, and with no proof of this connection the idea has fallen out of acce
ptance by most scholars. Both races dismiss the idea as screed, for what its worth.
\par 
\par The dabus are utterly loyal to Her Serenity, and any harm or molestation of the dabus is taken as a threat to Sigil itself. Those guilty of this crime are, if not immediate
ly, often sent to the mazes within a short period of time. On those rare occasions when a dabus has been killed, the murderer has been seen transfixed by the razor edged shadow of the Lady in full view of the public, flayed alive as punishment, their scre
ams lasting minutes before death takes them. 
\par 
\par The loyalty of the dabus however holds but one known caveat. And that is Fell, the fallen Dabus, whose pitiable and enigmatic story is penned elsewhere within this volume.
\par 
\par The final role the dabus play within Sigil is that of spokesmen for the Lady. Any proclamation of the Lady\rquote 
s will arrives through the dabus who in the past have appeared, one floating before Her, to serve as mouthpiece to their silent, enigmatic queen. The Lady, at most, points a sleeve in th
e direction of the intended target of Her message. The dabus then speaks with a rebus, headed typically by \lquote It is the will of the Lady that\'85\rquote 
\par 
\par But even when not speaking on behalf of the Lady, the word of the dabus can be taken and accepted as truth. They will not lie, and they will answer questions posed to them. Even questions as simple as \lquote Which way to the Great Bazaar?\rquote 
 will be answered, though the dabus have their duties, and repeated questioning may reward the berk with a cold shoulder as they ignore 
him. Of course, some questions the dabus may simply refuse to answer, or their answer may simply come as an enigmatic symbol or phrase with no further explanation. When asking them, \lquote What is the Lady?\rquote 
 for example, they respond once more with only the haunting image of the bladed aspect of Her Serenity, and nothing more. For them, and perhaps for us all, there is no further answer to be had.

t relinquish their political power in its entirety, the citizens of the Cage were left with a sudden power vacuum and cessation of an actual organized body to undertake the day-to-day running of vital civil services. Thus was the Sigil Advisory Council es
tablished.
\par 
\par The Sigil Advisory Council is charged with the running of Sigil in the face of the absence of the factions, since the guilds of Sigil do not at present have the numbers or the popular support of the population for the task. The current nine-memb
er council is elected on three-year terms, with the council chair elected for a four-year term herself. The chairman, or chairwoman as the current case may be, is elected from within the council itself rather than put to popular vote. Voting for the counc
i
l is run and overseen by the City Courts, with the dabus serving as impartial vote counters, and a single vote is given to every property owner within Sigil, without regards to the amount or value of the property. This last stipulation prevents the stacki
ng of votes by some of the more powerful and wealthy landowners in the Cage such as Zadara the Titan, Shemeska the Marauder, Timmon d\rquote Arlen, and Jeremo the Natterer.
\par 
\par And so, while not truly representative of the city, those paying taxes upon their property are represented considering that by and large their gold supports the city hierarchy. As well, despite the council\rquote 
s name, it has much more than an advisory role in the City of Doors. All of its declarations and rulings are backed by the City Courts, the agreement of the vast majority of the guilds, and by the City Guard if need be.
\par 
\par As of the Fifth Year of the Lady\rquote s Edict, the nine-member council is currently composed of:
\par 
\par }{\b\i\f30\fs20 Rhys}{\f30\fs20  (N female tiefling Mnk15/Sorc10 Transcendent 
Order) - Council Chairwoman and former factol of the Transcendent Order. Rhys has been the main balancing force on the advisory council in the years following the Faction War, able to uncannily head off tension and most open conflict between members or gr
o
ups within the city arguing for certain actions on the part of the council. She has been walking a fine line between her influence over the council and her influence within the former members of the Transcendent Order. For this matter, combined with her h
a
ving been the sole surviving factol from the Faction War, many of the council members have both respect and unease regarding her. In meetings she often displays a calm aloofness and uncannily perfect timing to interject with points during public hearings 
before the collective council. Chairwoman Rhys is, more than any other council member, assured of re-election when the current term is over.
\par 
\par }{\b\i\f30\fs20 Cirily}{\f30\fs20  (CN female firre eladrin Brd1/Ftr2 Planarists) \endash  An alarming and polarizing choice to sit upon the council, 
Cirily also serves as public spokeswoman and leader of the Planarists. This Sigil based sect would do nothing more than exclude Prime Material natives from Sigil, and then from the planes entirely. Her impromptu speeches nearly caused a riot on one occasi
o
n, and would have done so far more often if not for Rhys deftly heading her off by procedural means or simply matching her on a matter of will before the other councilwoman stood down. It is very likely that Cirily and Rhys will come to more than simply i
deological blows against the other if Cirily is continually blunted in her aspirations on the Council as she has been so far, with some small, but notable exceptions.
\par 
\par }{\b\i\f30\fs20 Elahassa Merem}{\f30\fs20  of the Order of Master Clerks and Scribes (LN female human Exp12 Fraternit
y of Order) - Councilwoman Merem has been a relatively quite and benign presence upon the council for most of her term, swaying towards the positions of Chairwoman Rhys as well as those of Councilwoman Cirily at times. Though she has been relatively fickl
e
 in her votes on the council, most think she is assured of re-election, mostly because the other members on the council feel that she is not tied down ideologically to any one of the other members. However, she has, on a number of occasions, quarreled wit
h Councilman Hatchis, more for his views on the Clerk\rquote s Ward, which in a way she exemplifies, than for his voting record.
\par 
\par }{\b\i\f30\fs20 Estavan}{\f30\fs20  (LE male ogre mage Sorc5 Fraternity of Order) \endash  Sigil\rquote s representative within the vast Planar Trade Consortium, his election w
as something of a surprise, even to himself. He has been largely quiet on the council, allying neither with any group nor with council member, which is unsurprising considering his own personal ambitions stretching outside of Sigil at the moment.
\par 
\par }{\b\i\f30\fs20 Gregory Holmin}{\f30\fs20  (LN male human Wiz6 Fraternity of Order) \endash 
 The former Magistrate of the Bureau of Commerce within the Hall of Information under the Fraternity of Order, Holmin is respected among the business leaders of Sigil, but is also, uncharacteristical
ly for a Guvner, something of a hothead and loose cannon at times. He has been a relatively independent voice on the council, with no allegiances to any other particular members except for perhaps Ustisha Cambris, and occasionally Estavan.
\par 
\par }{\b\i\f30\fs20 Harys Hatchis}{\f30\fs20  (NG male human Wiz8 Free League) \endash 
 Another unusual pick for the council, Hatchis has been a popular choice, especially among the smaller property owners and businesses of Sigil. Second only to Jeena Ealy in popularity as a standard council member, he has us
ed his position to advocate a number of reductions on the legislative red tape within the Clerk\rquote 
s Ward, as well as many of the restrictions placed upon merchants within the Market Ward during the pre-Faction War period. He has also been openly uneasy about the public positions of Councilwoman Cirily.
\par 
\par }{\b\i\f30\fs20 Jeena Ealy }{\f30\fs20 (CG female human Ftr9 Society of Sensation) \endash  The elderly councilwoman has more popular support than any but Chairwoman Rhys, and for good reason. For decades now, since her adventuring career with 
her late husband left her rich and drunk upon the sensations of the planes, Jeena has lived in the Clerk\rquote s Ward as a philanthropist and author. Her greatest work, }{\i\f30\fs20 Of Darkest Sigil}{\f30\fs20 
, exposed to many the truly inhuman conditions within the Hive, and the need to do something about them as a matter of conscience. Her influence in aiding Sigil\rquote 
s less privileged has been marked since her election. Due to age, it is uncertain if she will pursue a second term after her first ends in a year\rquote s time. She has been adama
ntly against the positions advocated by Councilwoman Cirily, and has voted time and time again for every piece of legislation put forward by Council Chairwoman Rhys.
\par 
\par }{\b\i\f30\fs20 Ustisha Cambris }{\f30\fs20 of the Builders\rquote  Fellowship (NG male human Ftr3 Fated) \endash  Ustisha has the 
support of many of the guilds, and along with councilwoman Merem, is responsible for all of the established guilds, and most of the new guilds, falling behind the council in public support. He has been deftly wielding his current position on the council t
o lower the city tariffs levied against the importation of building materials within Sigil, and has fallen into agreement heavily with Councilman Estavan on this matter.
\par 
\par }{\b\i\f30\fs20 Utadas Tensar}{\f30\fs20  (LG male human Clr10 Fraternity of Order) \endash  Considered one of the most h
onest men in Sigil, he has for years run the most respected and sought after employment service in all of Sigil from his office within the Clerk\rquote 
s Ward. His honesty and propensity for finding equally honest and skilled labor has given him a good name within the business community and thus a spot upon the council. He has however, indicated that he is likely to step down after his current term.

\par At current, the City Guard has numbers approaching around three hundred, roughly the same as a medium-sized guild. However, the guards are paid for their loyalty, and are little more than civilized mercenaries earning a pittance for their labors. It

\par 
\par The City Guard is currently based out of the Barracks, with 
eventual plans to possibly expand out to the Prison and split their numbers between the two strongholds. Currently the Guard is lead by Watch captain Danthis Highmoon (LN male aasimar Ftr12), who is currently trying to recruit more soldiers as well as tra

\par During the disintegration of the Mercykillers during the waning hours of the Faction War, the Sodkillers split with the Sons of Mercy, ex
isting as perhaps a darkly pragmatic reflection of their former compatriots. Having grown from initially a waxing sect, the Sodkillers exist now as a full-fledged faction. Since that time however, the faction is still wary of the Lady\rquote 
s Edict, and as such, the Sodkillers exist as the driving force behind the Minder\rquote s Guild. The guild, officially numbered among those of Sigil and recognized by the Sigil Advisory Council, operates out of the Clerk\rquote 
s Ward as a private service of thugs, mercenaries, and bodyguards for hire. Staffed and run by the faction behind the scenes, there is little to separate the two except on paper.
\par 
\par They have a reputation as being ruthlessly pragmatic, rough, and at times evil. The use of force in whatever form and methods needed to enforce order, regardless of its moral aspect, is common. That, by itself, sums up the group\rquote 
s creed nicely. The opinion of most tends to be that both the guild and the faction are honest, but only when paid for their service, and that they tend to enjoy the use of brutality more than to most cutters\rquote 
 taste. Those on the receiving end of the guild or faction\rquote s dispensations of justice to the highest bidder are likely to hold a much less sterling opinion.
\par 
\par Unlike the Sons of Mercy, the Sodkillers, fronted by a
 legitimate guild, possess a growing fraction of official power. The Sons of Mercy are still struggling to find official recognition of their efforts, but for the moment their harder nosed and more ruthless former compatriots hold the upper edge.

\par Arwyl has been through much in his life, and he will likely persevere through his current troubles. In fact, he first came to join the Mercykillers when, as a young paladin from the \line 
Prime world of Toril, he chased a succubus from his world onto the Outlands. He killed his target, but nearly died in the process himself, only managing to survive his wounds by the aid of a Justiciar of the Mercykillers. Impressed by the stranger\rquote 
s help, and the tales he told of his own bringing of justice to the multiverse, the young and zealous Arwyl traveled to Sigil and joined the faction as well.
\par 
\par His years within the Red Death tempered his zeal but also exposed him to that faction\rquote s use of ruthlessness and somewhat evil practices in their search for justice. His own nature rebelled against this, and despit
e his own attempts to swell the ranks of the Mercykillers with like-minded lawful good paladins to reform the group from within, he was only marginally successful before the faction was split in twain following the disappearance of Factol Alisohn Nilesia.

\par 
\par Since the Faction War, Arwyl and his band of white-armored paladins have taken to patrolling the city, and Arwyl himself can be seen partaking in their daily work, not one to use rank to avoid the same duties he gives out to his charges. His passion, and 
more so, his }{\b\f30\fs20 com}{\f30\fs20

\par Public mouthpiece, and some would say philosop
hical leader, of the newly risen sect known as the Planarists. Cirily, as a firre eladrin, appears as an elf or more so half-elf, with smooth, milky-white skin dotted with freckles in some places that at the right angle or correct light shimmer with a rud
d
y complexion. Her eyes are two featureless, glowing, crimson orbs within their sockets and her hair is a brilliant red that seems to waver and crackle on its own like a living flame. Sometimes her hair does burn as if afire, particularly when the arrogant
 
and self-assured Cirily becomes incensed with those arguing against her positions on primes, or when a prime in her presence fails to give her the proper level of respect she feels she deserves as both a planar native and mouthpiece of the waxing Planaris
ts.
\par 
\par The Planarists philosophy could be summed up as the following: The planes should be for planars. Prime Material clueless have no place outside their own plane and have despoiled the City of Doors for too long, spreading stupidity wherever they go. They
 utilize resources and space that could be given to a planar resident of the city, or indeed, to whichever plane a given prime defiles by their presence. Cirily can often be found preaching her thinly veiled philosophy of planar superiority and anti-prime
 
hatred in the Hall of Speakers or at the Trianym, never failing to attract a crowd. While an incredibly passionate, gifted, and charismatic speaker, some of her enemies have suggested her guilty of actually attempting to magically charm her crowds to inci
t
e them even further into believing her creed. Fellow eladrin have been rather loathe to discuss her in particular, and a few fiends have chuckled and mused over the fact that she may already have fallen from her natural alignment and inclination to chaoti
c good, and may be setting herself up for a true and total fall to chaotic evil.
\par 
\par In the wake of the Faction War, subsequent public investigations found the details of Duke Rowan Darkwood\rquote s personal involvement in setting the factions at each others\rquote  throats. Cirily jumped upon Darkwood\rquote 
s status as a Prime Material native, despite his long years in fiendish slavery on the Lower Planes, his decades of life in Ysgard, and his tumultuous time within Sigil itself. She posited him as the prototypical example of p
rime excess and the dangers of allowing more than a token population of primes within Sigil at all. All the more need to segway them off to their own ghetto within the Lower Ward or the Hive.
\par 
\par At present, Cirily finds herself elected to the Sigil Advisory 
Council, a dream come true for her as it stands. Many are unhappy with her new power but her followers are likely to see that she keeps her position for the present at least, and it would appear that she has backing behind the scenes as well by those with

Unlike the other dabus, Fell walks upon the ground, his feet clearly treading upon the earth. It is common to have 
seen him trip or stumble in his walks through the Market Ward, where he keeps a small shop on Redwind Road. His chosen vocation is the crafting of tattoos, which he forms from his own picture symbols above his head and then somehow transfers to the skin o
f his clients. Some have whispered that he also offers magical tattoos, but only to customers of his choosing.

\par When not in his shop, Fell frequents the back alleys of the Hive, usually seen bricking over the randomly appearing ooze portals of the ward, per
haps to reclaim some fraction of his old life in service to Her Serenity. He has no need of guards or protection when walking in even the Hive by himself. Not even the gangs and barmies within that ward are willing to take the chance of being close by sho
uld the Lady\rquote s shadow come passing over him, which many figure is only a matter of time.
\par 
\par Fact is, the reason for Fell\rquote s expulsion from the ranks of the Dabus is both valid and chilling. Since the death of his patron power and the shattering of the Cathedra
l of Aoskar in the Lower Ward, Fell has remained an outcast and pariah to his own kind and to most of Sigil. But until that day, Fell remains a sad, silent image that even the chosen servants of Her Serenity are not immune to Her wrath or the temptation o
f other forces.
\par 
\par While even Aoskar himself died that day, Fell yet lives. Perhaps he cannot die as a punishment by the Lady for his betrayal of her and his own kind. Perhaps Fell was so invested with a portion of Aoskar\rquote s power that by some virtue of this, 
the Lady could not kill him. Indeed, Fell can still cast divine spells, though he does so rarely. And some claim that this gives rise to the idea that Aoskar may have invested Fell as his own proxy before the power\rquote 
s death, or that the Portal Father may no
t be entirely dead. [And if the latter, I hold that Her Dread Majesty is not yet finished with Aoskar. For if Aoskar is not truly dead, and were to one day rise from his astral grave, I say he would not do so in defiance of the Lady, but at Her allowance 
in some vast and unknown plan that formed at or before his death at Her hand. A convenient, if frightening, portent. \endash  The Editor]
\par 
\par Fell will not openly speak of his fall from grace, but if asked in secret he will profess his faith in Aoskar still, unrepent
ant, and full of conviction. In conjunction with the Will of the One, a radical split from the Sign of One, he may in fact be attempting to light the spark of worship in Aoskar once more, seeking still to raise his dead patron from the grave.

missing jewels and usually tilted off angle, a curious artifact for so wealthy a man. Oddly enough, some magic or item about his person allows him to converse with dabus in their own manner of Rebus speech, something that gives him a great deference from

a
ir is tied into a tail at the top that blossoms up like some sky-seeking flower to cascade out and slightly down. A small, thin white scar extends over her left cheek and eyebrow, next to a small ring piercing the same. But aside from her own personal app
e
arance, her clothing attracts just as much attention, being an exotic ensemble of blue-black leather that tightly hugs her slim body and generally leaves little to the imagination. Despite the garish and tempting appearance, the spiked tip of her tail is 
typically ready to lash out at any berk with too audacious a hand.
\par 
\par Usually riding atop Kylie\rquote s shoulder or trotting along beside her is her pet, companion, or some say familiar, known as Dib. Dib is an ethyk, one of a species hailing from Arborea that appe
ars somewhat like a spider monkey with one eye and a long tail somewhat like a black and white raccoon. As far as creatures go, he\rquote s smart and utterly loyal to Kylie, and she\rquote 
s been known to use him to get leatherheads off her back, divert them from her tr
ail, or distract them long enough to bob them for their jink. As an ethyk, Dib has the ability to incite sudden blinding anger in a blood, usually in such a manner as to get a group to quarrel amongst themselves rather than attack him, or Kylie, and he us
es this ability with remarkable discretion and ability.
\par 
\par Kylie is renowned as perhaps the most knowledgeable and sharp tout in all of Sigil, and has cultivated for herself a reputation of knowing a vast number of contacts, and even a secret method of commun
ication to them when she wanders around the streets of Sigil. Her movements, from the sway of her tail to the twitch of her hands or expression on her face at times can go through a remarkable dance of gestures when passing by a random cutter or meeting a
nother. Perhaps they have a meaning, or perhaps it\rquote s simply a way of cultivating the idea that she\rquote 
s in touch with far more people than she actually is. With the growing number of former faction touts and independent cutters flocking to work under the banne
r of the guild she now finds herself heading, if her actions are indeed just a masterful bluff, they needn\rquote t be much longer.
\par 
\par Her earlier history, however, was much more tumultuous than her current. She first began work as a messenger under the employ of A
utochon the Bellringer, current guild master of the Messengers and Runners guild. According to members of the Runners guild, during one mission for him she simply took her payment, as well as the object she was tasked to deliver, and ran off to make her o
w
n profit with it. Autochon was enraged and would likely have killed her, had his own minder in the guise of Shemeska the Marauder not stepped in and told him to not just ignore her treachery, but to protect her and her growing group of independent touts s
he had been forming since leaving his employ. While baffled, Autochon responded to the tug at his metaphorical leash and did as he was told.
\par 
\par In fact, it may be that much of Kylie\rquote s current success is owed at least in part to Autochon\rquote s continued protection
 of her and her touts. Furthermore, the King of the Crosstrade may be a silent, unspoken backer of the young tiefling guild mistress, letting her build up her own guild and ring of contacts for reasons unknown. It\rquote 
s been known that Shemeska has professed a
dmiration for Kylie, and in glowing terms mentioned how much of herself she sees reflected back in Kylie. This at the moment bodes well for Kylie, but the Marauder may very well be seeking to eventually sink her talons deeper into the guild, or into Kylie
 
herself and take the group out from under her entirely once the fiend has finished fattening it up to her content. [Even Autochon himself doubts entirely that this is the reason his taskmistress has him protect Kylie and her own. Some other reason exists 
in his opinion that warrants Shemeska\rquote 
s personal interest. And myself, I feel that with the number of persons Kylie has trafficked with in recent years, who I will not mention here, that the Marauder may be simply waiting for her to drag one of them out int
o the light. The guild itself exists as only a juicy secondary prize compared to this other person, whoever they may be. \endash  The Editor]

Apparently, that chant never crossed Ramander's ears, or registered as dangerous. He appears to have simply thought it an ingenious scheme fit to make him wealthier than the Golden Lords of The Lady\rquote s Ward. It also didn\rquote 
t hurt that Shemeska the Marauder approached him during the initial stages of his scheme with an offer of protection. She claimed she could shield him from the Lady\rquote s anger over charging access to \'93his\'94
 portals. Of course, she lied through her teeth and hasn\rquote t so much as lifted a finger to help him, simply skimming her fraction of his profits. Likely the fiend is merely waiting for the time when he\rquote s re
moved from the picture entirely by his own stupidity. At that point it\rquote s likely she\rquote 
ll simply assume control of his properties and either sell them off, or more likely revert back to the much safer route of selling the portal keys and allowing otherwise un
restricted access to the portals themselves. It may not be surprising to note that Ramander may or may not have hatched the scheme himself, but rather been given the idea directly, or filtered down to him from his shrewish so called protector and business
 partner. [Shemeska\rquote

When action is thought, and thought is action, I will act in harmony with myself and the multiverse. There is no greater goal but harmony with oneself and one\rquote s surroundings in al
l things. Listen within, but do not shut out the whisperings of the planes, for the Cadence speaks, and I act.\'94 - Rhys
\par 
\par The enigmatic and serene tiefling Rhys, former factol of the Transcendent Order, stands as the current chairwoman of the Sigil Advisory Council. A tiefling of uncertain heritage, she typically appears dressed in the flowing monk robes of a member of the T
r
anscendent Order, though she has played this down since the Faction War. Like many tieflings, she has a tail, but unlike most her legs end in cloven hooves, much like the hind legs of a goat, below the knee. Her long black hair also tends to move, shift, 
and writhe like it is constantly tousled by some unseen wind, and her ears resemble nothing so much as exaggerated elven or half-elven ears.
\par 
\par All of these traits combine to give her an otherworldly air, combined with her own, at times, surreal sense of her surroundings and others\rquote 
 actions. Her traits as a former factol of the Transcendent Order make her seem to react to situations almost before it should be physically possible. Two former assassination attempts saw the tiefling turn to dodge perhaps a moment
 or two before the arrows had even fired from the bows. On one occasion, rather than dodge the attack she calmly stepped to one side, plucked the arrow out of the air mid-flight, and turned to calmly gaze at the would be killer who bolted without hesitati
on.
\par 
\par Her current position is likely owed to two qualities. First, she and her faction\rquote 
s reputation of acting as mediators between the other factions. It has been said before that the Ciphers would be reserve to a Sensate, mercy to a Taker, and order to a Xa
ositect; all actions to bring themselves and their surroundings into balance. As so with her faction, so with Rhys. Her leadership of the Ciphers saw them mediate a number of conflicts within the Cage, and while they could not prevent the Faction War from
 occurring, they did not exacerbate the conflict, and many of them aided in settling the chaos after the war had ended.
\par 
\par The second quality Rhys possesses, that none other in existence may say, is that she in some manner foresaw or felt the coming storm of 
the Faction War, and quietly left the city. She stands as the only factol to have survived the war that is not presumed dead, mazed, or flayed. That she did this and returned has given her an air of mystery and prestige that makes her normally serene and 
d
istant impression upon others seem all that more imposing. She claims, as do other high-ranking Ciphers, to be able to listen to and hear some sublime heartbeat of the planes themselves that Ciphers terms the Cadence of the Planes. It was this, she claims
, that warned her of the brewing Faction War and of every other situation she reacts towards.
\par 
\par Upon the formation of the Sigil Advisory Council, Rhys, having already stepped down from the Transcendent Order, accepted her appointment as chairwoman of the Vou
ncil, but dissuaded the remaining members of the Council from making her former faction hall, the Great Gymnasium, the council\rquote s meeting place. Such would, in her eyes, come too close to violating the Lady\rquote 
s Edict on the factions, and give an impression to
 the average citizen of Sigil that she herself, as well as her faction, might be wielding too much power and influence within the city. Rhys has much to do in her current position, and has been doing a wonderful job at it from all accounts. The city has s
eemingly recovered from the Faction War, the guilds have stepped up to fill the power vacuum, and no large-scale conflicts have arisen thus far under her watch. 
\par 
\par [More information regarding Councilwoman Rhys would have been included, however my attempts to
 gain an interview with her remain abortive. Upon meeting her and asking my first question, she simply stared at me for a few moments before nodding and walking off. We know that I simply wish to speak the truth and allow the common person to view it in o

th her eye color that day. But the mercurial Arcanaloth has a temper to match her vanity, and the slightest displeasure has been known to cause her to fly into one of her famed public temper tantrums, which typically end poorly for the sod that caused her
 to become unhinged. [Her public vanity is likely nothing more than a guise to make potential enemies underestimate her ability or personality. She is ruthless, utterly evil, and brilliant, even for her kind, make no mistake of this. \endash  The Editor]

\par 
\par All of her power runs just below the surface of polite society, and while her status and order of business is the single worst kept secret in Sigil, she longs to have some actual pull in the Sigil advisory council, especially as how Estavan the Ogre Mage

s natural suspicion of the fiend, but Shemeska plays enough to the ideals of the nearly fallen celestial that a working relationship may soon be more than a pipedream.
\par 
\par Aside from the advisory council, the Marauder has been the force behind the rise of Kylie the Tout in the newly formed Escorts Guild and Touts Guild. It seems the fiend has an interest in keeping Kylie safe. Rumor has it the tiefling may e

\par 
\par As an aside, Shemeska used to be called Sheme
sHka. It seems recently the fickle and self-obsessed arcanaloth up and changed the spelling and pronunciation of her name and, without spreading the word of the change, has expected everyone to call her properly by the new version. She\rquote

se and riffraff, it is hardly homogenous in any sense of the word. Several districts exist, some officially, others only by common convention among the residents. The Nobles District holds most of the high houses of the so-called Golden Lords of Sigil, th
o
se bloods holding a tremendous amount of wealth and many with more than their fair share of influence. The area around the Barracks, Prison, and City Courts, is known as the Triad District and has taken up a distinct flavor. Meanwhile, the Armory District
 has drifted slightly to present itself as more an open sore in the midst of the ward since the Armory\rquote s destruction during the Faction War, and its subsequent ruin and further collapse in the Vecna incursion some years afterwards.

 Situated near the Triad District, and forming the defining boundary between it and the Nobles District, sits the Palace
 of the Jester. The palace stands as the single largest structure in all of Sigil, its courtyards and the palace itself covering an area as large as any other three structures in the City of Doors combined. The alternate name for the Palace is the Court o
f Pain, and the entire sprawling structure serves as a neutral meeting ground for the intrigues and plotting of the various high houses and nobles from the district and even across Sigil.
\par 
\par Besides its immense size, the palace is likely the oldest surviving structure in all of Sigil as well. As far back as records go, the Palace of the Jester has been there in The Lady\rquote 
s Ward, predating even the City Courts it lies adjacent from, and the Singing Fountain that separates the two edifices. The reason for the structure\rquote 
s name, which it has always been called, has been lost to the passage of time, and even the purpose of the massive palace is forgotten. What is remarkable, however, is that the palace, for its size and grandeur, has sat for many years nearly vacant,
 with only the grounds surrounding the palace serving any real public function as a meeting ground for the prestigious and wealthy within cager high society. Inside the palace is mostly deserted, a confusing tangle of mazelike passages, chambers and galle
r
ies that fill the palace to the tips of its bladed spires and descend down to the ancient vaults and tunnels below street level. No known map of the interior exists, and so visitors are advised to limit the extent of their wanderings to the inhabited port
i
ons of the halls. The further down into the palace the stranger the architecture becomes. The lower levels appear as if they were designed by a genius or a madman, with a similarity that some have compared to the odd architecture of Harbinger House, the f
o
rmer Godsmen Asylum of equally unknown past history. Passages dead end, stairwells ascend to ceilings, windows open up to blank walls far below ground level, and chambers may be sealed shut from all sides but one while a maze of hidden passages winds thro
ugh it all, filled with the dust of centuries. Oddly enough, the dabus themselves seem peery about the palace, and those seen wandering its halls (having ascended from below?) are often described as acting\'85nervous\'85almost as if they\rquote 
re being observed. One must wonder what could disturb the dabus so within their own city?
\par 
\par In recent history, the Palace of the Jester has been the residence of Jeremo the Natterer and the Ring-Givers. Jeremo has been called the Lady\rquote s Jester, and speculation is abundant that the 
lord of the Palace of the Jester simply has taken the name out of irony for his home, and his own quixotic attitude. Others have suggested that the title is somehow linked to the palace itself, a hereditary moniker linked to whoever owns the palace. That 
in itself raises questions about the original purpose of the palace if that bit of dark holds true.

\par 
\par The contention arose in the past to the general appearance of the Armory with its smoke belching forges and razorvine encrusted lower portions, and to the seedy neighborhoods that arose 
around it. The former Doomguard, in their philosophical disagreement with the Harmonium, and to a lesser extent the Mercykillers and Fraternity of Order, made life difficult around their faction headquarters for the Harmonium and their allies. Hence, the 
Harmonium patrolled the district less and less, crime rose and knights of the post sprung from the woodwork. This did not bode well for its status in the eyes of the Golden Lords and power brokers in The Lady\rquote s Ward.
\par 
\par The destruction of the Armory in recent
 years and the events that swirled around it soon after only added to the contentions of some. The recent rebuilding of the Armory, the changing of its outward appearance, and the general improvements these have produced in the district have more or less 
negated its chances of being legislated off into the Lower Ward. Old feelings die-hard however, and some folks are still a bit peery walking around this section of the city, half expecting the Doomguard to harangue them in passing.
\par 
\par Still, the district has cleaned up in recent years with the attentions of Faith and her followers and is now solidly part of the Lady\rquote 
s ward once again, much to the approval of the patrons of the Golden Bariaur Inn. This inn at the very spireward end of the district, roughly thre
e blocks from the shadow of the Armory, is a frequent and popular spot for celestials of all alignments, as well as for the occasional fiends from the Lower Ward who stop in to make trouble.
\par 
\par In contrast however, situated between Cobbles Lane and Doomguard
 Walk, next to the Park of the Infernal and the Divine stands the silver bladed, black stone, Temple of the Abyss. Typically festooned with the previous nights sacrificial victims, the temple is only tolerated by many of the ward simply because of the num

 For almost a full four years after the Faction War, the Armory of Sigil sat abandoned after its collapse during the battle between the Harmoniu
m and the Doomguard and their respective allies. The persistent rumors, not entirely unfounded, which held that within the shattered pile of occasionally smoking rubble lurked a number of small and completely uncontrolled spheres of annihilation tended to
 keep away scavengers and vagrants. [And, for that matter, developers. \endash  The Editor]
\par 
\par In its original incarnation by the Doomguard, the Armory was graced with a massive bas-relief symbol of their faction upon the front exterior of the structure, four sprawl
ing iron latticework flying buttresses, and encrusted along the lower levels with razorvine. Four towers, each strangely free of crawling razorvine, flanked the corners of the building, each corresponding to the four negative touched Quasielemental Planes
,
 and indeed it appears that the towers were nothing more than empty stone husks from the exterior. But from the inside each contained a portal leading to an actual tower that stood within one of the four Doomguard strongholds in the plane it occupied. Sta
rting at the northeast tower and circling clockwise, the portals lead to Citadel Alluvius, Citadel Sealt, Citadel Exhalus, and finally the Crumbling Citadel.
\par 
\par From here, the Doomguard sold weapons created within the massive forges located inside, along with siege engines if the buyer had the jink for it, as well as stocks of unsold or defective weapons.
\par 
\par In the aftermath of the Tempest of Doors and the collapse of the Armory
, the portals vanished and the former Doomguard members fleeing to their strongholds on those planes had to do so the long way in their exodus to the Inner Planes. The weapons stored within that had not already been handed out freely by the entropy obsess
ed faction members and their weapons master, the recently deceased cambion Ely Cromlich, were looted from the ruins or buried within in the subsequent collapse of the building. 
\par 
\par In the past two years, the Armory has been rebuilt from its long languishing ruins in the corner of The Lady\rquote 
s Ward that threatened to cause the neighboring district to be claimed as part of the Lower Ward. The exterior is actually much the same, though it lacks the forges and weapons storage chambers, now being devoted to a much di
fferent moral and philosophical ethos than before. The rebuilding and conversion of the Armory has been orchestrated by Faith, the Harmonium factol. She has indeed not given up on Sigil, unofficially, and has seen to it that a blood by the name of Nicolai
 Mabru (LG male tiefling Rog5/Ftr7 Harmonium), a reformed chaotic evil tiefling and one of the Harmonium\rquote 
s success stories, has taken over the administration of the Armory. Mabru, as much an opposite to the now mazed Factol Pentar as two bloods could be, ha
s designed the Armory for the use of like-minded followers from Arcadia, and anyone within Sigil who would learn from him the lessons he professes on a daily basis on the nature of harmony. His relationship with Faith and the Harmonium itself is kept stri
ctly separate, and while he is certainly influenced by common ideals with the other Harmonium outside of Sigil, he has no direct links to the faction and is certain to keep it so, else he anger the Lady.
\par 
\par With a sense of irony, the rebuilt Armory has taken 
on many of the same roles of the Great Gymnasium, though with an emphasis on external harmony, law, and moral redemption through training and cooperation with others rather than personal harmony and enlightenment espoused by the Cipher\rquote 
s former faction hall.

\par During the long process of the Armory\rquote s reconstruction several things were oddly missing. None of the spheres of annihilation present during the Armory\rquote

\par 
\par This district has always, and for the most part, continues to be the most sterile and homogenized of the districts in The Lady\rquote s Ward. Sometimes referr
ed to as having the houses of law rather than the houses of gold in the ward, it is more the seat of official government within Sigil rather than the seat of oftentimes more influential cutters from the Noble\rquote

area immediately around the City Courts, most of the businesses are orderly, calm, and devoid of the chaos one might expect in the other wards, with the sometimes volatile mixing of races and philosophies. There are, however, some notable exceptions if a 
blood knows where to look.
\par 
\par One of the largest draws of the nobles and hoi polloi of The Lady\rquote s Ward, as well as every knight of the post and crosstrader in Sigil is the Fortune\rquote s Wheel inn, tavern, and gambling hall situated at the crook of Dossy street in
 the center of the Triad District. 
\par 
\par The Fortune\rquote s Wheel is comprised of several related establishments such as the Dragon Bar, the Dicing Cup, the Bear-Baiting room, and the Fortune\rquote s Wheel as well as a small inn above the gambling houses named the Azure 
Iris Inn. Night in and night out, the tavern is home to those seeking their fortune at the tables, seeking someone else\rquote 
s fortune at the same tables, to spend money with little regards to winning or losing, and more often than not to engage in the petty and often treacherous plotting of the Lady\rquote 
s Ward. The gambling hall, for this reason and this reason alone, is one of the principal haunts of the so-called King of the Crosstrade, Shemeska the Marauder, who dines at the Wheel nightly to broker information, both true and false.

s Ward, the Courts have always in the past and now in the present served to determine guilt and innocence of those sods f
ound to have broken one of the laws of Sigil. The Courts themselves did not make the laws of Sigil, but they did interpret them and determine guilt or innocence under those laws and pass sentence. From there the former Mercykillers, the Red Death at the P
r
ison and Tower of the Wyrm, carried out the sentence. The Fraternity of Order, the faction which until recently called the City Courts both their place of business and faction headquarters, deigned not to design the laws they operated under in the courts.

\par 
\par The Courts sit in the center of the ward, downward from the Singing Fountain and the Palace of the Jester. The typical sterile, clean, and to some extent rigid environment of The Lady\rquote 
s Ward might indeed take its cue from the Courts, which after all upheld the laws of The Lady\rquote 
s Ward that actually restricted the building codes and architecture for new buildings to a defined set of terms. However, that stereotypical environment has never really held true around the courts themselves. The paragons of law wit
hin Sigil are surrounded in the immediate neighborhood, to say nothing of the courtyards surrounding the Palace of the Jester, by numerous businesses that serve those who work for the courts directly or indirectly, and those hawking their wares and servic
es to those going before the courts and the families of those same. Taverns and bub halls abound as well as morticians and undertakers, scribes, and most importantly, advocates to plead the case of the accused before the courts.
\par 
\par Especially so with the advo
cates, the Courts and the plaza surrounding it along with the public waiting halls just inside are abuzz with competing lawyers and other court servants to where it seems as if chaos might be reigning in the place of laws. A bit of unique irony in the hea
rt of Sigil.
\par 
\par Within the Courts, besides the courtrooms of law themselves, a number of different former Guvner halls, record chambers and the law library of Sigil reside. Many of the Guvner records and books left with them, but the library itself is compreh
ensive in the extreme if a blood doesn\rquote t mind sitting down and doing a bit of research. The answer to most any question is there in the stacks if one but has the patience to equal one of the Guvners who wrote most everything there.
\par 
\par The Courts still hold the same function and purpose as before now with the resolution of the Faction War, but shortly after the war, and with the death of the Guvners\rquote 
 factol, Hashkar, the majority of the faction members picked up their belongings and depa
rted the Cage for the faction holdings on the plane of Mechanus. Understandably, this left Sigil in the position of having very few qualified judges left in place to keep the courts and relevant bureaucracy in operation.
\par 
\par The seeming conundrum was solved i
n short order by the most unexpected of cutters, the dabus. Explaining their eagerness to help fill the positions vacated by the Guvners, yet without actually stating this to be the directions of Her Serenity, they took up the positions of judges left vac
ant. As judges, the dabus are incorruptible since they don\rquote t take bribes, can\rquote t truthfully be threatened or cowed into a particular decision, and are fair in their judgments. The trick, however, is that being dabus, they don\rquote 
t speak except through Rebus, an
d this requires skilled, professional translators, of which few in Sigil existed before recently. Now it seems that along with lawyers, professional dabus translators are required for both plaintiff and defendant, since an outcome of guilt or innocence ma
y hinge on the exact, and not always unambiguous meaning of a string of illusory letters and symbols. A sentence may be passed with both sides declaring victory based on their own interpretation. 
\par 
\par After only a year however, the dabus serving in the courts 
made it known that while they could perform their new jobs, qualified former judges, even those who had been Guvners, which is to say, nearly all of them, would be welcomed back in their former positions. The caveat was that any returning judges would hav
e to hold themselves to the same standards as the dabus, and couldn\rquote 
t act as arms of their former faction and its philosophy in carrying out the business of the courts. Recently, former judges have been returning to their positions, but not yet enough of them have done so to relieve the dabus completely.
\par 
\par In any event, the judgments of the court might range from a fine, public service, imprisonment, or rarely execution. The latter has been rarely enacted, likely due to lingering memory of the public spectacl
es that the former Mercykillers under Alisohn Nilesia made of such death sentences.
\par 
\par The sequence of justice is fairly simple. The City Guard apprehends the accused officially, though just as many are brought in by the Sons of Mercy, and to a lesser degree
 the Minders Guild. While awaiting trial the accused may be incarcerated at the City Barracks, and any future incarceration takes place there as well, though in the future this may change to the Prison depending on the petitions of the Sons of Mercy. Foll
owing judgment, criminals are punished by officials within, or hired by the Guard, especially in the case of executions.
\par 
\par }{\b\f30\fs20 City Barracks}{\f30\fs20  \endash  Forming a rough triad of law and order along with the Prison and the City Courts, and a stone\rquote s throw from the rebuilt Armory, the utilitarian hulk of the City Barracks stands in The Lady\rquote 
s Ward. The stark, many would say ugly, structure sits as a great square of heavy gray stone situated between the Boulevard of the Fist and Harmonium Street. 
\par 
\par During the heyday of the Ha
rmonium the City Barracks was a constant and orderly place filled with the ubiquitous pounding of stiff, heavy boots on equally stiff and heavy stone. Four towers and four walls with a dull, slate tiled roof looking like some bland, apathetic artistic wor
k of a petitioner of Hades, the lawful nature of the place tended to suck the more lively aspects from the blocks surrounding the building. The constant Harmonium patrols ensured that the least infraction of Sigil\rquote 
s laws around the faction headquarters would not be overlooked, but rather be made an example of. After all, they were the Harmonium, and their might made right. But that was then, and times have changed.
\par 
\par The ground level of the Barracks comprised the public areas of the building as well as the ma
ssive central courtyard, itself used primarily for the training and drilling of Harmonium novitiates. The lower levels comprised auditoriums, classrooms, a mess hall for faction members, numerous training rooms, and the faction dormitories.
\par 
\par The second level of the Barracks held the officers\rquote  quarters as well as the factol\rquote 
s office and the residence of their family. Many of the faction records herein, including the bulk of the arrest records dating back over two hundred years, simply vanished during the per
iod immediately after the Faction War. While the bulk was discovered strewn in the streets or for sale by knights of the post in the months later, the current location of a number of them, including a period comprising twenty years from the previous centu
ry have yet to be recovered.
\par 
\par Since the assassination of Factol Sarin during the Faction War, and the destruction of the Armory during which a great number of the Harmonium within Sigil died, the faction has picked up and mostly abandoned the City of Doors.
 The barracks has been reclaimed by the new City Guard, but with neither the stiff efficiency nor tough zeal of the former occupants. And to the same extent law and order in the city suffered for some time, and still does with the Minders guild and the So
n\rquote s of Mercy attempting, and mostly failing, in some ways to pick up where the Harmonium left off. Some would rejoice at this, others long for the days of the Hardheads, but it\rquote s unlikely they\rquote ll return en masse in the near future.

\par 
\par }{\b\f30\fs20 Prison}{\f30\fs20  \endash  Comprising two 
distinct and once connected structures, the Prison proper and the nearby Tower of the Wyrm, the former faction headquarters of the Mercykillers, stands just spireward of the intersection of Prison Row, Rotten Row, and Guvner\rquote s Mile at Couriers
\rquote  Square.
\par 
\par Fu
lly three times the size of the City Barracks, the Prison stands 1,100 feet on a side between each of the four corner towers, with a further four towers of smaller stature arranged within each exterior wall. The walls stand seven stories high, and while t
h
e building looks solid enough from the exterior, the interior of the Prison is mostly a single giant courtyard. The interior of featureless gray and brown dirt is marked only by the two walkways that hang above the pit and allow for watching of prisoners 
on exercise. 
\par 
\par Beyond the main gate of the Prison, which faces Courtiers\rquote  Square, are the chambers formerly devoted to faction business, while the rest of the interior of the prison is composed mainly of cells for prisoners. While the prison has divested it
self of many of the prisoners, it held formerly during the reign of Factol Alisohn Nilesia, the cells are slowly filling once more with the lawbreakers of Sigil, among them the more violent ones released on the misguided but good intentions of Arwyl Swan
\rquote s Son during the last days of the Faction War.
\par 
\par As dreary and oppressive as the main aboveground bulk of the Prison may appear to inmates or even a passerby, similar to the City Barracks, the worst was mostly unseen and unknown by the public \lquote till recent ye
ars. It seems that below street level, carved out of the stone of Sigil\rquote 
s ring, sat an underground level filled with solitary confinement cells for hardened prisoners as well as for random intimidation and psychological torture of simple inmates. The so-ca
lled Cellars, along with dining halls, laundry rooms, and other chambers for work detail for prisoners, were filled with the torture and sentencing chambers of the condemned and a poor sod had no way of knowing when on a daily basis he\rquote 
d be descending to the Cellars for simple work detail, or to face the gallows.
\par 
\par The Prison is slowly being refit and rebuilt, and there are indications that the Sons of Mercy may attempt to officially petition to run the facility and to handle the incarceration 
of prisoners now currently being held in the Barracks and its adjacent buildings. This, of course, raises the hackles of more than a few council members, both for the giving of that official power to a faction and the proximity to the Sodkillers.
\par 
\par Adjacent to the Prison and standing within Petitioners\rquote  Square rises the Tower of the Wyrm, a relic of Sigil\rquote 
s past now serving as the headquarters of the Sodkillers and emblazoned on all sides still with the crimson dragon symbol of the Red Death. Inside, the tow
er was once filled with petty prisoners and interrogation rooms as well as the towers namesake, the Wyrm, or Cage Serpent. The Wyrm was a specially bred wyvern, magically enhanced by the Mercykillers to produce venom that induced delirium in prisoners whe
n
 extracting confessions. Executions by hanging, as well as being simply devoured alive by the Wyrm, were commonplace during the reign of Nilesia, but since then the tower has not seen a public execution. It is unlikely that the Sigil Advisory Council will
 sanction any such actions by the Sodkillers.

 The Hall of Speakers was formerly the faction hall of the Sign of One and the forum
 in which the factions met to spout their arguments over philosophy, city business, and to preach their take on the world to everyone who would listen. More often, those who were there to listen were bound by their own factions to do so in order to wait t
heir own turn to speak.
\par 
\par Externally, the Hall of Speakers is a thing of beauty, a great oblong curved dome, topped by a carved, tall, graceful spire. Other smaller, but equally elegant spires rise from the lower sides of the dome, many of them of different 
colored stone or magically ornamented. Standing near to the dome rises a great iron statue called the Power of One, depicting a woman smiling and holding aloft a sphere of a Prime world cradled in one hand. Yet another lingering remnant of the now dead fa
ction.
\par 
\par Inside the Hall, the central hollow is filled with a well-tended garden, still cared for by former faction members and paid gardeners employed by the new owners of the structure seeking to keep it as attractive as the Signers kept it in previous yea
rs. Beyond the garden, an area previously off limits to non-faction members, stands the private meeting halls of the Sign of One as well as the chambers of former ex-Factol Darius, herself consigned to the Mazes. [Factol Darius, \lquote The Veyl\rquote 
, went to the Maz
es and her faction has disintegrated without her leadership. However, she left us not without lingering friends in high places. Friends who owed her debts. Friends such as Bel, the Lord of the First Layer of Baator. If Bel yet considers himself to owe Dar
ius his debt, she may not linger in the Mazes forever. \endash  The Editor]
\par 
\par Additionally, and of great public interest of late, is the oval tomb of the founder of the Sign of One, Rilith. Her remains are said to rest within an urn carved from a single milky pearl. In the past, Signers would gather here to \lquote imagine\rquote 
 the tomb\rquote s existence, keeping it a reality, for they claimed if they ever stopped imagining her as having existed, they too would cease to
 exist. Contrary to their beliefs perhaps, the tomb still exists, under guard, with none to constantly sit and believe in it.
\par 
\par For years, however, the hall, while ostensibly open for debate by anyone in the public body politic, was used exclusively by members of Sigil\rquote 
s factions. To combat the seeming powerlessness of the general public in Sigil to speak and have their words actually heard, there stands the Trianym, similar in function, if not at all in form, to the Hall of Speakers. Three brick columns all
ow for speakers to stand and debate, while three large benches allow for onlookers and spectators to listen and as appropriate hurl coins or refuse at those speaking.
\par 
\par Just a short distance and within easy sight of the Hall of Speakers, stands a great statue, the largest such in Sigil, of a rearing, three eyed Nic\rquote Epona. Called the Trioptic Nic\rquote 
Epona, or by locals as the Triona, the statue is a genuine thing of beauty. While not actually the property of the Hall of Speakers\rquote  owner, it has long been associat
ed with the Hall for aesthetic reasons. It was long protected and kempt by the members of the defunct faction of the Doomguard, and held a number of portals to the Prime, Elysium, and Mount Celestia within the bound spaces of the platforms before the Temp
est of Doors.

\par Recently now, with the cessation of faction business in the Hall, the new owners have taken to renting out space to the numerous private meeting chambers and even the old council chambers and podium of the speaker. Public interest has remaine

 What existed once as a private university within Sigil known as Bigby\rquote s College of Academic Arts and was subsequently repossessed by the Fated, now exists as only a pile of rubble atop the cluster of
 hills it once occupied before the Faction War. Shortly after the war ended and the Fated fled Sigil for their old faction headquarters upon Ysgard, the building and all the vast number of public records, including debt notices, were ransacked by the curi
ous, the greedy, and those seeking to erase their very existence in the records of the purse pickers of Sigil. Nothing remained sacrosanct, and from the vaults of records to the very furniture, the entire building was looted clean.
\par 
\par Years of tunneling beneath the buildings to build secret vaults in which to store the supposedly public records, as well as ex-Factol Rowan Darkwood\rquote s reams of research into Sigil\rquote 
s past history, left the ground under the entire complex weakened and under the constant threat of c
ollapse. Faced with the danger to the surrounding blocks in the ward, the entire edifice was picked clean of any remaining records or usable goods, and the building was torn to the ground and many of the tunnels purposefully collapsed. Undisclosed parties
 have since purchased the site, and to date it has yet to be developed, remaining a jumble of brick and marble surrounded by the wooded campus that originally surrounded the Hall.
\par 
\par Despite the demolition of the Hall of Records, the five other largest and mo
st important buildings on the old faction grounds still exist. The Halls of Property Records and Census Records, the Faction Dormitory, Faction Hall, and the Rowan Academy of Training yet stand on the grounds, though each was ransacked in turn just like t

\par Surrounding the Civic Festhall, in the rough triangle of the ward between Crystal Dew Lane, Hull Road, and Thistlewind Way, the Festhall District does its best to enliven the orderly and sometimes bland Clerk\rquote s Ward.
\par 
\par Even with the official cessation of or
ganized activity by the Sensates within Sigil, the vast majority of the bloods retain their old positions as a matter of habit, comfort, and ability. In that respect, little has changed in the Festhall District since the Faction War. Shops selling fine wi

\par 
\par Spireward from the Civic Festhall and further adding to the festive atmosphere of the district is the Lazz School of Vivid Unpleasantness, a more avant-garde 
center for the graphic and performing arts in Sigil. Former members of the Bleak Cabal and Free League tend to be attracted to the school and its frequent, often controversial performances.

h all sit within walking distance of each other in adjacent wards, the Civic Festhall stands as one of the most beautiful pieces of architecture within all of Sigil. Like the Great Gymnasium, it has seen little outward change in its operations since the F
action War, despite the disbanding of the Society of Sensation, which built and operated the Festhall.
\par 
\par Situated in the Clerk\rquote s Ward at the corner of Crystal Dew Lane and Festive Way, the elegantly spired and gloriously decorated building has stood for over
 six hundred years and was built and planned over the course of a further century. The Society of Sensation left nothing to whimsy in the construction of the Festhall. Everything from the mineral veins present in the marble blocks used to construct the ou
ter fa\'e7
ade, which details in mosaic the five senses, to the color of the ore used to build the bladed spikes, spires, and flying buttresses that radiate from the building like the spines of a great ocean mollusk was carefully planned. The interior walls wit
h their alternating rough and smooth patches, the tiny carvings playing like crawling vines across the corner of a tile in even the remotest corner of the main hall\rquote 
s expanse, every bit of the Festhall has something for one to experience and ply the senses
 with. Nothing was left to chance; all was planned for years as a single great and wondrous artistic expression of the experiences to be had by a cutter in Sigil and across the multiverse.
\par 
\par Once past the elaborate doors of the main entrance, each over nine
ty feet tall, the grand hall is filled with the scents of a hundred perfumes drifting on the air flowing from any number of people or classrooms throughout the first floor of the building. Off to either side the space is filled with classrooms and lecture
 
halls that concentrate on any of a hundred topics that are never the same two days in a row. Lecture topics may range from mundane topics of academia such as the types of githyanki Astral Carracks over the past century, to a free for all food fight within
 a closed room with baatezu cuisine just because they threw tanar\rquote ri food the other day. 
\par 
\par While the Sensates have officially abandoned Sigil, its members left only in name as most of those running the Festhall today are Sensates. They continue to perform t
heir duties even without the official backing of the faction. [At least the public backing of it anyways. \endash 
 The Editor] Most of the entertainment and scheduling of performances within the Festhall is arranged by a cutter by the name of Annali Webspinner (C
N female bariaur Ftr7 Society of Sensation). She still retains the position in the Festhall she had before the Faction War, losing none of her purpose or ideals with the fall of her faction\rquote s power.
\par 
\par Aside from the lecture halls, there are rooms that had p
reviously been reserved for Sensates to use once devoted to training new and old techniques in magic, combat styles, and roguery. All manner of styles and techniques are trained therein, and now since the Faction War they\rquote 
ve ostensibly been open to the pub
lic, though for a charge, and for a lower cost if a blood has donated experiences to the public or the sensoriums before. The sensoriums themselves are one of the key draws of the Festhall, being a collection of experiences encompassing emotions, sights, 
touches, smells, and tastes. All of the collected experiences are the memories of those same experiences drawn and given freely from a cutter\rquote s mind with the purpose of sharing them with others.
\par 
\par Outside the Festhall and set on adjacent hillsides stand two 
auditoriums, the Northumber Amphitheatre which is in open air and the Elloweth Theatre which is shielded by a translucent covering of capiz shell to allow in light. Both are used for live performances of musical and theatric presentations, typically in da
y
light hours. Other concerts, plays, and the like are held within Ren Hall inside the Festhall itself to packed crowds regardless of the price of admission. These larger scale events are held twice a night with staggered styles of performances between even
ings.
\par 
\par Also within the Festhall are numerous guest quarters as well as the previously private chambers of former Factol Erin \lquote Darkflame\rquote  Montgomery. Since the factol\rquote s disappearance during the Faction War, presumably to one of the Lady
\rquote s Mazes, the chambers
 have lain undisturbed and her former faction members have done their best to keep away prying eyes from this and supposedly deeper chamber within the bowels of the Festhall. Little known except to Sensates, the interior dimensions of the hall are signifi
c
antly smaller than the outside dimensions would allow for, suggesting unused spaces or chambers concealed to the public. One such chamber is said to be a hall of portals to various planes called the Sanctum Sanctorum at the very heart of the Festhall. The
re is also rumored to be a now collapsed tunnel that led from that hidden chamber to the depths of the former archives beneath the now destroyed Hall of Records.

\par The Guildhall Ward, in its storied past was once, in the years before the Great Upheaval, the center of real power in Sigil. Then, before the Lady reduced the number of factions to fiftenn from the hundreds of squabbling, competing ones before, the real
 powers in Sigil were the talented groupings of workers and craftsmen of the Guildhall Ward. By pooling their numbers and power, they could out maneuver the ever-fighting factions. But the consolidation of the factions after the Great Upheaval saw to the 
decline and eventual end to the guilds grip on Sigil, and indeed many of them ceased to exist in time as the factions took control of more and more of the Cage\rquote s institutions.
\par 
\par Since the fall of the factions as organized or official powers within Sigil, it 
would appear that the guilds have been making a resurgence in importance and visibility. Most of the guild houses lay in a rough circle around the center of the ward, clustered near to the Great Gymnasium. Among other examples, both the Escort and Touts G

\par }{\'93What marks the Market Ward, and separates it from the Guildhall Ward? Simple. The Market Ward is filled with my type of people, and the Guildhall Ward a little l
ess so. Here in the Market Ward we make our way as much on our own labor as we do on our intellect. I like that.
\par 
\par \'93I\rquote ve been seeing less of the Ward lately though. And with that I\rquote ve been seeing less of the bustle of the traders, merchants and vendors, half of them paying me to hawk their own products for them. I\rquote ve been cooped up in the Clerk

ith a bully pulpit under them. Some say it suits me, but I still look forward to going back to my own kip down from the Great Bazaar at the end of the day.\'94 \endash  Harys Hatchis
\par 
\par Two things dominate the Market Ward: money and the actions that make it flow between and grace the palms of those making it. Buying, selling, and bargaining. Such is the language of the Market Ward. 
\par  
\par The ward itself is less diverse than the other wards of the city, in terms of districts, anyways. Really only two distinct districts exi
st in the Market Ward, which is sometimes grouped together with the Guildhall Ward, despite the rising prominence of the latter.
\par 
\par The Market Ward, while smaller in size itself than other wards, is of such financial importance to the city it has remained se
parate. Since the Tempest of Doors, however, much of the interplanar trading, especially that handled by Estavan of the Planar Trading Consortium, has moved out of Sigil to the Outlands and other routes free from the potential for the Lady\rquote 
s disruption.
\par 
\par Copperman Way, cutting its way through the Market Ward from the Lady\rquote s Ward, is the home of most of the wealthier merchants and shopkeepers operating out of the Great Bazaar. In reality, it\rquote s an imitation of the Noble\rquote 
s District one ward over, and most of the merchants along the street would dearly love to one day be able to call the Noble\rquote s District, or even another of the districts within the Lady\rquote s Ward, home.
\par 
\par Dominating the ward itself is the Great Bazaar, sometimes erroneously called the Grand Bazaar.
 This sprawling, open-air market serves as the heart of the ward and of most commerce in Sigil itself. Previously the bazaar was the center of activity of the Free League. Many of the members of the league left Sigil following the Tempest of Doors, but a 
l
arge enough amount yet remain in the city that perhaps one in every three sellers in the bazaar has some tie to the League or was a former member themselves. Even without actual faction hierarchy, the loose network of the League yet exists and allows for 
t
he quick flow of information and favorable business deals among associates within the League. This has made it difficult for those not associated with the League from hedging their way into many contracts and trade agreements in the ward. Primarily this h
a
s complicated issues not for smaller and individually owned businesses and craftsmen, but for larger planar trade groups such as the Merkhant sect and the Planar Trade Consortium under Estavan the Ogre Mage. This is likely to lead to fiercer conflict both
 in and out of the city in the coming years. [Estavan still has ambition, fiercely so, despite his quite nature within Sigil of late, despite his goals within the City of Doors effectively mangled by the manipulations of Zadara and Shemeska \endash

\par 
\par T
he Great Bazaar, despite the efforts of both the Harmonium and the Fraternity of Order in the past, remains a cluttered, sometimes confusing, ramshackle collection of merchants selling their wares and hawking their products from established buildings, ten
t
s, pushcarts, and even from their own hands at a street corner. This mercantile free-for-all sometimes may seem to be more than a bit chaotic, and if a cutter is searching for a particular merchant or item, the best option is to seek out one of the many t
o
uts that wander the district, many of them Free League members themselves. Even without a tout, with but a minimum of wandering through the huge expanse of the Bazaar, one can find most anything from across the planes for the right amount of jink. Everyth
i
ng can be found, from mundane foodstuffs from Bytopia, to the skull of a howler from the third layer of Pandemonium, or a shard of black ice from Ocanthus in Acheron. But with the amount of jink passing from palm to palm, and purse to purse, pickpockets f
rom across the Cage are eager to help themselves to their own portion of it, and a large number of them prey upon unwary shoppers to the ward using either elaborate scams or simple pouch pilfering.

 he may be an outcast of his own race for whatever reason, up to and even possibly including the fact that he may even be a risen fiend. A\rquote kin doesn\rquote 
t like to talk about his past, or the rumors about himself, and inevitably he just shrugs and soon enough the conversation is slid back to the health of the questioner and current happenings in their life.

\par At the edge of the Lower Ward, situated close to the Hive and adjacent to the Ditch, stands the Shattered Temple District, so named for the 
former faction hall of the Athar and former cathedral of Aoskar. Twice now it appears Her Serenity has disposed of the residents of the district, most recently the Athar, but also, uncounted centuries ago, the clergy of Aoskar and the power of portals him

\par 
\par The obliteration of the temple of Aoskar and the surrounding blocks in all directions gave the district a reputation as cursed and haunted, blighted by Her Serenity. As

 Currently a flurry of activity in the ward surrounds the former Athar citadel known
 as the Shattered Temple, formerly the grand cathedral of the deity of planewalkers, portals, and opportunity known as Aoskar. After the mazing of Factol Terrance of the Athar, the majority of the Lost fled Sigil and now find themselves camped at the only
 
other place of sanctuary in the multiverse from the wrath of the powers they railed against for so long: the base of the Spire in the Outlands. A few of the Athar remained, however, and work to inform their brethren in the Outlands of the events in Sigil 
as they attempt to regain control of their former headquarters in the City of Doors.
\par 
\par The Shattered Temple appears from the exterior as a broken and barely standing sanctuary of crumbling stone, ancient and fallen from the beauty it once held. Its stone arc
hes and spires may once have reached up to the sky, but now reach up barely a few stories and end at broken or severed ends. Nevertheless, even in its state of apparent decay the place is still evocative of faded glory.
\par 
\par Within, the temple is anything but 
shattered, and multiple wardings support the exterior stone and grant it strength beyond what it may have possessed originally. The interior is splendid, if cramped, and the Athar utilized the former gallery and rectories as scribing chambers for producin
g the tracts and leaflets they used to attempt to undermine the faith of the inhabitants of the Cage in the powers they deemed false and unworthy of both worship and the title of divine.
\par 
\par Surrounding the Shattered Temple is a wasteland of abandoned building
s that appear much like the level of destruction present in the Slags further towards the Hive, across the Ditch that flows within sight of the Temple. Whatever force destroyed the surrounding blocks did so utterly, and as legend goes, did so in the space
 of seconds. The ruins have always been considered cursed or unhealthy and were mostly abandoned, much to the delight of the Athar who enjoyed the respite from their enemies among the faithful and their clergies within Sigil. 
\par 
\par The layout of the temple is o
f a main sanctuary, ensconced with the crumbled listing buttresses at the center of four great terraces in the cardinal directions, and the old temple wings to the aft of the main entrance downwards from the sanctuary, each flanking left and right and use
d as refectory and scriptorium by the former faction.}{\f30\fs20\cf6 
\par }{\f30\fs20 
\par Beyond the old temple wings, at the center of the ruins, lays the former grand sanctuary of Aoskar, now barren but for a crumbled husk that was once the great Tree of the Athar, the Bois Verdurous, and 
perhaps an object of their faith in something beyond the divine pretenders of the multiverse. After its apparent destruction in the heat of the Faction War it has withered away to its present state, though the entire area still glows with a diffuse but po
tent radiance of divine magic.
\par 
\par Surrounding the sanctuary are the libraries, offices, and chambers of the faction high-ups, including Factol Terrance himself. Flanking the sanctuary stand the Piebald Tower, Rus
t Tower, Glisten Tower, and the Fallen Tower, the origin of their names lost to the long stretch of years. It was here, between the Fallen and Glisten Towers, that the Athar possessed a portal that rumors suggest once went either to the Athar citadel in t
he Astral or actually opened upon the rocky godisle that is Aoskar\rquote s remains, also drifting through the Silvery Void.
\par 
\par Finding the Shattered Temple abandoned by the Athar, Friar Muriov Garianis, a cleric of Hades, and Oridi Malefin, a cleric of death and cu
rrent factol of the Dustmen, have made known their plans to raze the temple to the ground and rebuild in its place a grand temple to Hades. Most of the trappings of the Athar have been set aside or destroyed by Friar Garianis, all of it a heresy in his vi
e

 more hotheaded and reactionary Athar make themselves and their terrific displeasure at this affront known.

\par }{\b The Temple of Pallid Doors}{ - Somewhere in the back alleys of the Lower Ward there lays a small abandoned building, described by some who\rquote 
ve seen it as a ruined, defaced temple. Thing is, none can seem to reliably find their way back there. It\rquote s almost as if the kip moves around within the district, or even the ward itself, when it doesn\rquote 
t want to be found. Mappers and portal seekers have walked around the ward for hours at a time without seeing anything reasonably similar to the site, or even th
e buildings it was said to have been found nestled between, usually at the end of a long blind alley. Most reports of the building have come from the drunk, barmy, or simply those lost among unfamiliar streets when the smog from the foundry gets too terri
bly thick to see very far.
\par 
\par The general description of these cutters details the building as being little more than a two-story tower or pagoda, the roof partially collapsed over time, and constructed from some unremarkable gray, whitewashed stone. A fine l
ayer of ash usually coats the walls and floor inside the building and out into the alleyway. A symbol of sorts, possibly a holy symbol at one time, seems to have graced the lintel above the doorway, but has faded with time or due to purposeful defacement.

\par 
\par A sense of uneasy foreboding extends from the place, and animals are reportedly spooked and refuse to enter. Magical animals, such as familiars, share a similar feeling but at prodding of their masters have entered to no apparent ill effect. Inside, peopl
e report an empty sanctuary with stone pews and a simple stone block of an altar below the collapsed portion of the tower. Two empty rooms branch off from the sanctuary, neither showing sign of recent usage. Others have reported dead insects and vermin at
 the doorways, always facing outwards as if they died running from something, but there are never markings of violence on the insect husks and desiccated animals. 
\par 
\par One story is that the temple contains a number of curious permanent portals including those 
to the layer of Oinos on the Gray Waste, the layer of Mungoth on Gehenna, and to the layer of Belarian on Elysium. But as portal seekers never seem to find the kip to even confirm it exists, this remains unproven, even as to where this dark or screed conc
e
rning the portals first originated. In fact, aside from similar curious, and possibly spurious stories about random Cagers and clueless stumbling across the ruined kip, no official records indicate that it does now or ever has existed at any point in Sigi
l\rquote s history. Then again, Sigil\rquote 
s history gets very hazy the further back one searches, and the temple may be both so incredibly old that it has been forgotten along with whatever was once worshipped there. Whatever its origins, the place doesn\rquote t seem to not
 want to be found by those searching for it, and many have come to the conclusion it doesn\rquote t exist at all. [Truth is oftentimes stranger than fiction. Mark my word it does exist. \endash  The Editor]

\par }{\b\i The Slags
\par }{
\par The Slags, even more so than the devastation surrounding the Shattered Temple within the Lower Ward
, is a literal blighted wasteland within Sigil. Untold millennia ago a portal to Sigil opened into the heart of a Blood War battlefield upon the Grey Waste, and for whatever reason the Tanar\rquote 
ri forces seemed to think the portal a purposeful gift to them leading to either a sanctuary for their forces or a depository of weapons and supplies. And so, utilizing typical Tanar\rquote 
ri logic, they led their forces en masse through this unknown and uncalled for portal, directly into the heart of Sigil. The Baatezu invol
ved in the battle, not to be denied a victory over their eternal foes, followed suit and both armies spilled out into the Cage. Thousands of fiends spilled over into the cities like a tide of blood, fire, and iron, and fell to butchering each other, as we
ll as the horrified residents of the ward, and tearing apart the city in search of the weapons or other supposed stashed supplies.
\par 
\par The fighting raged for nearly a week before Her Serenity, in logic as elusive as that which allowed them within Sigil to begi
n with, ejected the warring armies back to the Lower Planes. Still, the district was all but leveled, strewn with bodies, the twisted wrecks of fiendish siege engines, and the remnants of the armies that were not sent back for whatever reason, some of whi
c
h linger to this day. The district has yet to be rebuilt in all that time, between the frequent cagequakes that make any attempted building repairs an exercise in futility, and the infestations of dretches, manes, vargoulles, cranium rats, and a mystery c
alled Kadyx.
\par 
\par Kadyx, or The Kadyx, has existed in the Slags as something of a blood soaked enigma, given credit for infrequent and typically unique murders within the Slags. A body might enter the Sl
ags and be found later with his bones picked clean and arranged into a play on words of his own name, or dressed in his own entrails, stitched together in a mockery of finery as if he were late for an evening dinner party. Thing is, none have seen Kadyx e
n
ough to give a reliable description other than fangs, claws, perhaps some ebony black scales, the scent of cinnamon, and that it appears to be able to burrow into the earth. It is also somehow capable of avoiding all manner of magical scrying and other su
c
h divinations. It might simply not exist, and be a legend used to mask the killings of criminals within the Hive and Lower Ward, perhaps the Garianis family even. Like many such tales, the answer is likely to remain dark. [More horrors beyond imagining ha
ve arisen in the midst of the Blood War, but when one is abandoned by its makers\'85 - The Editor]
\par 
\par Of recent note is an upswing in the numbers of cranium rats seen in and around the Slags, and even more so, fights between small groups of them have been rumore
d as well. Inevitably, the original sources of such rumors never seem to be found. It is not uncommon to find the bodies of beggars or criminals found at the edges of the district, nearly drained of blood from a thousand tiny cuts and slashes as if from t
he bites of a swarm of vermin. Oddly enough are the fights between such groups of vermin as the beasts are said to share a common hivemind, linked to some unseen master. [Odd to think what this might bode within a house divided. \endash  The Editor]

\par Spikeward from the Gatehouse, just beyond the sprawl of beggars and slums that rings the Gatehouse for a number of blocks, the Hive actually contains a relatively well-kept district. Known as the Marble District, for its cluster of a few blocks of gray
 and white marble buildings, it\rquote s a spot of relative calm and civilization inside the ocean of urban wasteland it barely rises above.
\par 
\par Most official government buildings in the ward reside in the Marble District, as well as a branch of the Minder\rquote s Guild that has taken to selling their services to a number of alehouses and less reputable members of the Hive\rquote

 Perhaps the oldest of the former faction halls, the Great Mortuary sits like a great bladed and spiked scarab between Blackshade Lane and the so-called Ragpickers Square within the heart of the Grey District in Sigil\rquote 
s Hive. Appearing as a single great dome with several adjacent towers, it looks somber and uncaring just like the former faction that operated it, many of whom continue to operate it.
\par 
\par Adjacent to the Mortuary, sprouting off of its main
 bulk are a number of mostly featureless mausoleums only accessible from within the Mortuary itself, as well as a large public memorial. This memorial sits within a half-walled courtyard, in the center of which stands a single spike of flat black stone. U
pon the stone, scratched, etched, and carved in tiny print are the names of the dead who have passed through the gates of the Mortuary. A dead cutter\rquote s relatives can pay a few coins to have the sod\rquote 
s name inscribed for all eternity upon the face of the stone, though this requires writing over some other berk\rquote s name at this point.
\par 
\par The Mortuary functioned then and now just as its name implies, it took in the corpses and remains of Sigil\rquote s dead, prepared them for claim by relatives of the deceased, and cremated the dead of the city\rquote 
s unclaimed. Prior to the Tempest of Doors a great portal to the Elemental Plane of Fire sat at the heart of the Mortuary, and it was through this that many of the unclaimed bodies of the city were hurled to be immolated and disposed of.
\par 
\par The first level of the Mortuary contained a great hall in which visitors waited to claim the bodies of the dead or attend funerary proceedings. The rest of the floor was dotted with a number of memorial halls for the presentation of noted dead awaiti
ng burial. In the past some of the side chambers held a dormitory for faction members, as well as a chamber for faction records and the faction library.
\par 
\par The second floor contained preparation rooms for the dead, as well as the faction armory, further interment chambers, and the offices of the faction high-ups. These officiating chambers sit mostly empty now, their office holders either mazed, in Skall
\rquote s case, or departed to the faction\rquote s citadel upon the Negative Energy Plane.
\par 
\par The highest chamber of the Mortuary contained the massive portal to the Elemental Plane of Fire, as well as a scattering of other portals, including one to the faction\rquote s citadel. Furthermore, the factol\rquote 
s private quarters and a laboratory remain here today, mostly unchanged since the war. After the Lady\rquote 
s Edict, most of the faction members, having little to no emotion, simply went about continuing their old business just as before, but now without calling themselves a faction proper.
\par 
\par Additionally, and only having become common knowledge recently, the lower levels of the Mortuary connected to a warren of catacombs of the entombed dead which also connected in parts to the uncounted miles of UnderSigil\rquote 
s tunnels, vaults, and forgotten passages. But of most interest in the bowels of the M
ortuary were the great number of portals that allowed the Dustmen access to numerous planes throughout the multiverse. Through these portals the faction was able to ship out the bodies of those deceased who wished to be returned to life back on their plan
es of origin, as unnatural as many in the faction held such magics to be.
\par 
\par Some of the former Dustmen wandering the halls of the Mortuary have of late claimed to see an image of their former factol walking the quiet halls. Usually the witnesses claim to hav
e seen his figure turning a corner, or passing just out of sight from the edges of their vision. Nevertheless these witnesses all swear upon the concept of the True Death that it was in fact Skall. Truth or screed? Skall was mazed, and it is unlikely any 
may escape from those personal hells without outside aid or the will of Her Dread Majesty. On the other hand, the Dead aren\rquote

kall certainly seems a spry old fellow. Be it truth or screed I cannot say, but within Sigil the impossible is witnessed everyday, so I will not pass judgment here. Either Skall has found a way to project himself, or an image of himself, out of his maze,

\par Just spireward from the Mortuary lays the drab, and some say menacing, Gray District, home to many of the Dustmen that operate the Mortuary. Of course, with the changes in the portals within the Mortuary, it may not retain its use forever.
\par 
\par Common sights within this district are the sullen, emotionless Dustmen who linger still, not possessed of the motivation to do anything else, even after the \'93disbanding\'94
 of their faction. Zombies, skeletons, and even wights, among other undead are seen wandering the district as well, typically in tow with one of the yet living Mortuary workers.
\par 
\par For being in the Hive proper, and not the Lower Ward, the streets and kips populating the area are clean, well-tended and free of refuse and razorvine. Old habits die hard, and despite the blan
d and perhaps disturbing aspects of the buildings and residents, the area is much safer than most other areas of the Hive aside from some of the insular racial enclaves. Things appear to be deteriorating, however, in the wake of the Faction War some five 
years ago, and it is likely that in time the Grey District will be swallowed up by the rest of the Hive and lose its distinct flavor.
\par 
\par }{\b\i Darkwell Court
\par }{
\par The stretch of kips known as Darkwell Court lies between Whisper Way and Sandstone Row in the edge of the Hive closest to the Clerk\rquote 
s Ward. This community and its peery-sounding name are home to the largest population of githzerai in Sigil, and true to form, the insular bashers have constructed a slice of their monastic society from Limbo within Sigil. None of
 the typical spiked, razorvine wrapped, bladed eaved kips common to the rest of Sigil. Instead, the homes are dull, flat-roofed, rarely over a single story high, and rounded in places. The wizened matriarch of the community, Divin Anesh (LN female githzer

\par Sigil\rquote s only body of water, if one 
can call it that most of the time, sits at the edge of the Lower Ward and the Hive, serving as a convenient boundary for the two. Refuse is constantly dumped into the waters that range from a bare, sluggish trickle at worst, to a clear running river when 
some hidden portal to Oceanus opens on random occasion and flushes the stagnant contents.
\par 
\par Normally, however, the ditch is filled with a slow moving, stagnant bilge, bobbing with rotting corpses, kitchen scraps, and all manner of refuse hurled into it for e
asy disposal by the neighboring residents. Rag pickers and dead collectors hover around the banks nightly to pick through the daily trash left upon the banks or bobbing near the surface in the hopes of making a few copper from some trinket tossed into the
 mix or sell the bodies to the Mortuary, which still pays a pittance for the dead.
\par 
\par Some have described the Ditch as the }{\i\f30\fs20 concept}{\f30\fs20  of a river, some abstraction of the idea of a Prime Material body of flowing water. And being the Outer Planes, who\rquote s to say it\rquote 
s not correct? What ordinary body of water has mildly to heavily corrosive water five out of every six days, with the sixth day more likely than not being frozen over at the surface? It isn\rquote

 find a single water genasi lingering around the Ditch either, though they flock like mice to cheese when the portal to Oceanus opens on those rare occasions. Some have postulated that it may be a tributary of the Styx itself, but none have ever reliably 
claimed to see a marraenoloth plying a skiff on its banks. [Not to say the Styx doesn\rquote t have any tributaries within Sigil, one just has to know where to look. \endash 
 The Editor] Rumors also hold that each night the dabus congregate upon the banks of the Ditch to push trash and other such detritus into the river to be flushed in the periodic cleansing of the trough. Then, there is the Ditch Beast.
\par 
\par Some say the Ditch Beast is a legend and myth, a creation of the barmies and bubbers on the Hive side of the stinking
 waters. Others claim to have seen the creature just barely cresting over the water, devouring corpses and dragging in unwary sods, but only in the dim hours before and after anti-peak. Truth be told, the Beast may not exist at all and simply be an illusi
on, some sort of animated Rebus created by the Dabus who congregate upon its banks at night, all in order to keep locals from interfering with their necessary tasks.
\par 
\par Probably of more danger to the unwary who find themselves wandering close to the waters of
 the Ditch are the wererats who answer to Tattershade (CE male human wererat Rog5/Ftr4) their self proclaimed king. Chant holds that he lives somewhere in a warren of tunnels within UnderSigil that open to the surface near the spireward end of the Ditch. 
V
isitors to his realm beneath the streets, paid to repair the tunnels and ward them against intruders, have claimed that the passages in some places are formed of a different color rock than typical of the Great Below. They claim that the rock takes upon a
 marbled consistency and color, and proves impossible to damage or otherwise mold by hand or by spell. These areas seem to be riddled with small, branched chambers, much like the inner hollows of a human\rquote

\par The chant further claims that Tattershade either took possession of parts of his underground realm from the dabus by force, or more commonly that he came across the realm, 
devoid of dabus or any other creatures and claimed it as his own. How this fits into the wererat king\rquote s current obsession with his own safety, his supposed hiding from something in fear of his mortal life, or his rumored search for }{\i something}{

\par 
\par One of the more notable, and utterly unofficial, spots within the district is the so-called Night Market, somewhere between Lot\rquote s Lane and Laughing Cat Alley. Just like the Great Bazaar, but with a darker side, the N
ight Market sells goods and services, but nothing therein has a name or a past. Don\rquote t inquire as to the origin of any of the goods, or the names of any who might be hired for a service. It\rquote

\par One of the other oddities of the district is the new feature 
near the center of Laughing Cat Alley, near the Night Market. A bowl-shaped depression roughly a hundred yards across that contains the street, and now one building sinking into it. The adjacent structure, a now collapsed flophouse, is a pile of rubble li
n
ing one side of the sinkhole. Travel along the street has been slowed, but not stopped. What bothers many is that the depression was once a slight rise in the middle of the street. As it goes, a number of years prior, there once stood a freestanding arch 
o
f black stone in the center of the street containing a portal to one of the layers of Baator. The frequent passing of hellhounds and other, less welcome, visitors to the ward finally became too much of a burden to the factions and so they toppled the arch
w
ay and paved the current street over it. The latest feature of the alley begs the question: did the toppling of the archway cause the portal to cease its intermittent function, or has it remained active all these years, with perhaps something now lingerin
g
 under the city streets biding its time. The factions no longer exist officially to investigate, and the Hive dwellers could care less until a gang of Baatezu rips their way up from below, so the status quo is likely to continue as the depression expands 
even more.

 The Gatehouse, former faction hall of the Bleak Cabal, sits atop a slight hill in the Hive, rising above the reek and filth of the slums that sprawl out around it along the edges of Bedlam Run. This massive structure sits just at
 the edge of the Hive, on one side nearly overlooking the urban wasteland of the Slags, in range of the stink carried on the wind, if not actual sight. On the opposite side it sits adjacent the Marble District of the Hive, and within actual sight of the D
itch, the filth-strewn canal that separates the Hive from the Lower Ward. 
\par 
\par The center of the structure appears as a great semicircular, roofless tower with decorative, bladed spires that bubbers claim resembles the wings of some great slumbering beast. And
 to speak of great beasts, a titanic steel portcullis bars the entrance to the tower, its bars some five feet in diameter, each bar separated from the others by another fifteen feet. The gates no longer operate, having rusted in place uncounted centuries 
ago, but the sheer size of the gates make it not hindering in the least to the average size sod who wanders into the Gatehouse seeking the ministrations of the Bleakers.
\par 
\par Branching off from the gate are two large wings of the building, one of which serves a
s both hospital and poorhouse for the sick and hungry of the Hive. The Bleakers ask no questions of those who enter seeking aid, and give what they can, only spouting their philosophy of madness and inner meaning if asked by the curious or the desperate. 
The second main wing serves as both asylum and orphanage for the ward, a beginning and an end for many of the pitiful residents of the slums.
\par 
\par Behind the tower, and mostly out of the view of the rest of the ward, are two smaller wings. These serve as a madh
ouse for members of the Cabal, as well as the criminally and irretrievably insane. Several past factols of the Cabal, long ago descended into the madness of their calling, are housed within. They languish within, locked away for their own, and others

\par Finally, walled off from the rest of the Hive, situated between the wings of the Gatehouse are three forested courtyards, one for the poor and orphaned, one previously open only to the Bleakers themselves, and one for the use of the insane.
\par 
\par The cur
rent occupants of the Gatehouse, the Bleak Cabal, only took up residency in the past five centuries, though the original origin of the sprawling complex has been lost to time. In fact, the Bleak Cabal took their faction symbol from an obscure symbol found
 
upon an ancient tiled mosaic deep within the Gatehouse, meaningless out of the context of its unknown history. They found irony, or some manner of comfort, in taking a meaningless symbol as their own, mirroring their own philosophy of meaninglessness in t
he multiverse at large. 
\par 
\par Likely the building is one of the oldest in Sigil, though it is probably not as old as the Palace of the Jester. But it does beg the question as to what use the truly massive steel gates of the tower were ever used for. Merely deco
ration, or in the dim past did they require actual use in order to keep something out, or lock something away? Could something that massive have simply walked the streets of Sigil at some point?
\par 
\par Further rumored is that somehow the Gatehouse, mostly because of its name and age, is in some way connected to the Lady\rquote s Mazes. No real proof exists for this conjecture, but it doesn\rquote 
t stop the barmies of the Hive, and some of the Bleakers themselves, from spouting the screed that the Lady\rquote 
s Mazes bubble up all around the Gatehouse, and all one must do is simply find the elusive portals leading to each and every one of those personal hells\'85

\par }{\b\i Giant\rquote s District
\par }{
\par In the past decade, almost unnoticed among the other major happenings within the Cage, a large number of giants and giant-kin have formed a small but growing district within the Hive. Many of them hailing from Ysgard, much to the chagrin of Sigil\rquote 
s bariaur and dwarven communities, the giant community has settled into a district nestled at the edge of the Hive adjacent to the Clerk\rquote 
s Ward. Many of the ramshackle structures that predated their arrival have since been demolished with zeal by the larger-sized beings, and architecture better suiting the giants\rquote  physical dimensions erected in their place.
\par 
\par Many of the community, however, are a decade later still adjusting to the planar cosmopolitan nature of the City of Doors. The Minders Guild is now in the unique position of having clients in two wards reque
sting aid in preventing the occasional raid by the giants into adjacent neighborhoods, while at the same time attempting to sway a number of the more lawful members of the giant community into joining the fold. [The giants are still adjusting to the conce
pt of not hurling chunks of masonry at non-district dwellers passing through, much to the Sons of Mercy\rquote s dismay. \endash  The Editor].
\par 
\par }{\b\i New Tyr
\par }{
\par This small squat was settled by a number of bashers from a Prime world called Athas some years ago. The self-sufficien
t and tough bashers that call it home typify the area; they respect strength but seem mighty peery of wizards and gith of both varieties. In recent years, the residents have taken a great shine to the clerics of a number of Sigil\rquote 
s major temples that have preached to the community in order to gather converts. The concept of deities who exist and answer prayers seems almost a novel concept to the Athasians, and a growing minority of them have converted to several of Sigil\rquote 
s major faiths with gusto. Among the
 population, which is largely human, there are a number of half-giants, various genasi, and a number of odd human/dwarven half-breeds called muls by the locals. The citizens of New Tyr have attracted a large amount of attention from the Sodkillers for the
ir seemingly inbred toughness, resilience, and work ethic. Thus far, however, the faction has had little success in persuading the Athasians to fall in any numbers towards their own philosophy.
\par 
\par [Oddly enough, elves have reported the distinctly unpleasant feeling of being watched when traveling the streets of New Tyr, as well as hearing a vaguely insect-like chattering. \endash  The Editor]
\par 
\par }{\b\i Chaos District
\par }{
\par Filled with more barmies than perhaps the Gatehouse\rquote s insane wings, the seemingly mad by choice residents of 
the chaos district are Xaositects to the core. The district itself sprawls out around the former main haunt of the Chaosmen, a building called the Hive. [the on Xaositects Count a confuse body to. \endash  The Editor]
\par 
\par A jumbled mix of the naturally chaotic races
 and chaotic representatives of other races not normally given to overtly chaotic tendencies populate the entire area surrounding the former Xaositect headquarters. Among the freewheeling population are numbered humans, tieflings, chaonds, githzerai, half
-elves, a few other prime races, and a very small minority of cambions and alufiends. Full-blooded Slaadi and Tanar\rquote ri are common sights here, and the rare Eladrin may be found, but most of the exemplar transient.
\par 
\par Streets curl and twist at, well, random th
roughout the district, sometimes simply ending at a blank wall. Kips are built up and burned down in the space of a week, and little in the area has the bearing of the years about it. Nothing lasts; everything changes. [Above all, carry no expectations an
d remain wary. \endash 
 The Editor] The district has most recently been splattered with paint, the hallmark of the Painter and her gaggle of groupies, admirers, and fellow self-appointed artists. Everything from buildings, to lampposts, to the street itself has be
en painted in anything ranging from beautiful renditions of scenes from a dozen different planes to random splashes of discordant colors. In any event, they\rquote 
re just as likely to continue their pigmented assault of the district as to attempt to burn it down the next day. In that, at least, they\rquote re predictable.
\par 
\par }{\b\i Goatswood
\par }{
\par This quaint community of humans within the border area of the Lower Ward, spireward of the Ditch, has at times in its centuries-long history been swallowed up by the Hive and reclaimed by t
he Lower Ward innumerable times at the whim of the City Courts and mapmakers of Sigil. The inhabitants hail originally from a dead or dying Prime world named Ranais. Having suffered greatly themselves, they have traditionally been welcoming and respectful
 to those bashers who have been through strife and persevered. A blood has little to fear treading the streets within this district if he does the inhabitants no harm.
\par 
\par }{\b\i The Lotus Blossom District
\par }{
\par The exact position of this district has been a matter of debate for the past decade, during which it has swelled in size, and likewise in importance. On the hazy border between the Clerk\rquote 
s Ward and the Hive, this district is more a cultural rather than a racial enclave, in comparison to other such small neighborhoo
ds and districts. The Lotus Blossom District takes its name from its design in the shape of a Lotus Blossom, a common flower on those Prime worlds whose inhabitants make up most of the district\rquote s residents.
\par 
\par The style of the residents, and indeed, the architecture of the district in particular, breaks with Sigil\rquote 
s norms, as such enclaves are often noted for. The residents of the district primarily hail from those worlds worshipping the Chinese Pantheon or the 
Celestial Bureaucracy, such as the Torilian continent of Kara-Tur and the Prime world of Rokugan. Primarily human, there are also a smattering of other races not commonly seen elsewhere in Sigil such as ogre mage, nezumi, hengeyokai, vanara, and a dwarven
 subrace called korobokuru. Other races emerge from time to time, but are not usually seen by outsiders.
\par 
\par The district is segmented into several subsections, each taking the rough shape of a lotus petal. The Red District is known for a high trade with the H
ive in drugs and prostitution, with many illicit dealings happening underneath the ornate, gilded surface. [Reminds me of the Lady\rquote s Ward\'85 - The Editor]. 
\par 
\par The Blue and Yellow Districts are populated by temples that cater to the district\rquote s residents, inclu
ding a large temple currently being built to honor Sung Chiang, the Lord of Thieves. It has been speculated that a portal to the Teardrop Palace, or to somewhere else in Gehenna, exists in or near the new temple. None have determined whether this is fact 
o
r hearsay, however, and the Guild of Doorsnoops has had little luck in investigating this. The only difference between the Yellow and Blue Districts is the presence of more scribes in the Yellow, and more priests and temples in the Blue. They are structur
ally similar otherwise, with little transition between them obvious to an outsider. Oddly, Wei Minh Lee, a Golden Lord of The Lady\rquote 
s Ward has never once been seen inside the district, despite the presence of a temple to Shou Hsing, the power of longevity that he claims to be a proxy of\'85
\par 
\par A large number of members of the Mind\rquote s Eye have taken up residence within the Yellow District in the past year. Most of them have emigrated from outside, though some have arisen from members of the community that have taken
 up membership and belief in the faction\rquote s creed. The group seems to fit well with their surroundings, and if they continue to grow, though they may soon command more influence within the district than they currently can manage.
\par 
\par The Black District is a sm
all but dense area closest to the Hive, crammed with tenement buildings and little else. The squalor here exceeds that in many areas of the Hive proper since there are all the more berks trying to squeeze into an area of similar culture. Crime is rampant 
and non-district residents are advised to avoid the area or travel with an armed escort. The Minder\rquote 
s Guild would be more than happy to provide protection to those traveling through this district considering the lack of inroads they have had into the area in general among the residents.
\par 
\par Central to the Lotus Blossom District is the White District, home to the wealthiest and most influential of the district\rquote s community. Perhaps the most influential member of the district\rquote s elite is Xin Ming Ue (LN female crow
-headed tengu Sohei11), a female tengu of extraordinary influence in the district for good and ill alike. Her kip and surrounding grounds in the center of the district are remarkably spacious for the area, including an orchard of cherry trees and rock gar
dens. 
\par 
\par The number of fiends in the district, both baatezu and lesser yugoloth, has increased in the past year, and it has been speculated that either the supposed portal to Gehenna has garnered much traffic, or that a member of the district has had increas
ing dealings with the Lower Planes in a grab for power from the established district leaders. Within the area, the chant has either a secret member of the Illuminated from Plague-Mort residing in the district, or that an underground war is brewing between
 rival ninja clans seeking to establish a beachhead within Sigil from a common Prime home world. It\rquote 
s also been rumored that the ogre mage Estavan has been seen frequently in the district, speaking with a number of the residents of the White District. He likely seeks to establish connections inside the district, but as always with Sigil\rquote 
s powerful, his motivations remain dark. [Makes sense. He\rquote s faced extreme competition elsewhere from Zadara and Shemeska, and so it seems appropriate he would attempt to parley his cultural similarities into business relations. \endash  The Editor]

\par 
\par }{\b\i The Ooze Portals
\par }{
\par One of the more notable, and dangerous, features of the Hive are the preponderance of a certain types of portals leading to the Paraelemental Plane of Ooze. These Ooze o
ddly shaped portals take the appearance of puddles in the winding streets of the ward from the shantytowns of the Gatehouse District to the monuments of the Gray District. Most take the appearance of puddles of the mildly acidic rainwater common to Sigil,
 others the appearance of pools of slime or sludge, and still others at the hours of antipeak have been seen to give a faint phosphor glow.
\par 
\par Unlike most portals within Sigil, the Ooze portals within the Hive are perpetually open to some extent. Stepping into one of them will result in falling bodily into the paraelemental plane itself, typically to one\rquote 
s death by drowning, if the victims are unable to catch themselves before falling fully through. Even those who blunder into the portals by accident are the m
inority of victims; the majority of those who vanish into the portals are grabbed and pulled through to the other side by the distended, blindly searching arms of ooze mephits that have the ability to reach through and grapple anything unwise enough to be
 in the vicinity. Whether the mephits are just curious, mischievous, hungry, or malevolent is largely unknown. Most sages are unwilling enough to suffer the presence of one of the muck-covered, reeking pests long enough to ask them their intentions.

\par 
\par Most Hive dwellers know enough to avoid the portals when they see them, those that can\rquote 
t either avoid all puddles in the ward or tend to fall victim to them. The clueless, on the other hand, are the prime victims to the portals that appear and vanish at uneven, 
seemingly random intervals. Many wonder why the ooze portals are allowed by the Lady to exist in Sigil, and then only in the Hive in their perpetually opened state. Aside from their danger to the unwary, the portals are used by residents to dispose of tra
sh, refuse, and, according to rumors in The Lady\rquote 
s Ward, the corpses of victims of theft and murders in the ward. The only blood that seems to have much interest in the portals aside from their use as dumping grounds is Fell, the fallen Dabus who wanders th
e Hive, bricking them over to seal them off. Otherwise, they seem to exist for no reason except as a hazard, unless one desperately needs transport to the inner planes. [Much cleaner and safer routes exist. Few would willingly subject themselves to the el
emental realm of muck and mire beyond the portals. \endash  The Editor]

\par While not a ward or really a place known in any great detail to the vast majority of the citizens of Sigil, the networks of passages, tunnels, and caverns beneath the streets of the Cage are unique enough to warrant their own description.
\par 
\par UnderSigil is not a homogenous network of passages and tunnels, and indeed many of the known and suspected networks do not connect with one another. Many of the excavated passages are examples of vastly different points in Sigil\rquote 
s history. Some of the tunn
els appear to be from recent centuries, such as the caverns underneath the neighborhood of Gurincraag in the Lower Ward. Other passages that have been found are from the largely unrecorded, mist shrouded past of the City of Doors, such as the unmapped lab
yrinth beneath the Palace of the Jester in The Lady\rquote s Ward.
\par 
\par Various parts of UnderSigil open up into all of the wards of the city, though precious little of the network is mapped in any detail. Many of the tunnels quarried out in Sigil\rquote s past have simply b
een forgotten as the years have passed and their creators passed away into dust and ink on forgotten and unread books. In fact, most of these formerly unknown vaults and passages have been found quite by accident by others digging in basements or deeper v
aults beneath established buildings. [I suspect that less than 20% of the expanse of UnderSigil is publicly known. And I stress publicly known. Some within the Cage know far more than others on this matter. \endash  The Editor]
\par 
\par The Twelve Factols Inn within The Lady\rquote 
s Ward is known to connect by tunnels into portions of the Realm Below, and the Dustmen also have excavated catacombs beneath portions of the Hive, especially under the Grey District near the Mortuary. These tunnels have added to the network of passage
s, and in places they have blundered into even older and deeper warrens under the feet of Sigil\rquote s residents.
\par 
\par The tunnels dug down into the great ring of Sigil are excavated through a rocky material which is present nowhere else in the multiverse. Sigil-rock, as it\rquote 
s called, makes up the base upon which the City of Doors is built atop the Infinite Spire. Thing is, no graybeard can really tell you just what it is. The material defies identification, and any dwarf, mason, or earth genasi can take one look at 
it and dismiss any idea that it\rquote 
s natural rock of any kind. Sigil-rock is hard and difficult to chip by tool or shape by magic, similar to granite in its natural state. However, any of the rock that is separated from the ring of the city begins to rapidly 
grow brittle and crumble to dust in a short period. This is why the base of Sigil has never been mined for building material, requiring that such foundations be imported from across the planes.
\par 
\par None know just how thick or deep the ring of Sigil is. Some g
raybeards believe that one could burrow down and reach the outer side of the ring, falling out much as is the case with a berk jumping over the wall in Suicide Alley. None have ever achieved the task, and it may in fact be impossible. Perhaps if one keeps
 digging they simply pass unknown through a portal, or maybe the ring adjusts size to accommodate the tunneling within it. Nothing is impossible, and it\rquote 
s known that Sigil has shrunk or expanded in size at times in the past, presumably at the will of Her Serenity.
\par 
\par Because of the uncommon, and unnatural, qualities of Sigil-rock, the few known attempted settlements by earth genasi within the Realm Below have all failed. None of them lasted more than a year or two before the residents moved aboveground to esca
pe an environment that they claimed had \'93not the spirit of true stone\'94. If even those with the essence of stone and rock flowing through their veins felt uncomfortable within the depths below Sigil\rquote 
s streets, it casts a dim view upon the nature of the substance that the City of Doors supports itself upon.
\par 
\par Also common within the Realm Below are the Sigil-unique events known as cagequakes. Similar to an earthquake, these far too frequent events may cause the collapse of poorly constructed tunnels. Rarely do 
these events occur in such a magnitude that they manifest upon the surface, and even more rarely do they cause any more than public distress, rattled window panes and a few cracked walls or foundations. But within the bowels of UnderSigil such events are 
f
righteningly common and more intense. Falling rock and shifting passages are common, especially the deeper down a blood travels or the poorer the construction of the tunnel. [The very existence of cagequakes poses interesting questions about the nature of
 Sigil. And even more questions arise if one were to approach the issue with the supposition that none of the cagequakes were by chance, but rather by design. Nothing of Her Dread Majesty\rquote s design is by fickle whim, nothing. \endash  The Editor]

\par 
\par And it seems like
ly that to some extent, the tunnels and passages of the Realm Below do indeed subtly shift position or location over the years. Whether this is by the actions of cagequakes, or by some property of space within the ring of Sigil itself, the reason is unkno
wn. [The mazes of elaborate, forgotten, and nigh incomprehensible tunnels deep under The Lady\rquote 
s Ward are perhaps the most drastic examples of this property, and, from what my own eyes have observed, I am not certain that all of that labyrinth resides within Sigil. \endash  The Editor]
\par 
\par Many of the passages of UnderSigil are infested with such vermin as cranium rats, which themselves appear to have burrowed out their own networks of tunnels, fitted to their own diminutive size. Other passages have been known to cont
ain or belch out to the surface such beings as lesser fiends, vargouilles, and the occasional undead. More commonly those passages and vaults closer to the surface serve as shelter and refuge for criminals, many of them running from their punishment at th
e hands of the City Guard, the Sodkillers, or the Sons of Mercy. The addle-coved and barmy are in no small abundance within the Realm Below as well, with likely as many, or more, dwelling unheard beneath the streets than within the Gatehouse itself.

\par 
\par In fact, within the second level of the Realm Below, in passages branching out and away from those excavated by Sigil\rquote 
s residents, there are many who call themselves Darkers, forgotten and unrecorded. Small isolated communities of these cutters exist, who for their own reasons have shuttered themselves away in the darkness and confined spaces of Sigil\rquote 
s underground. These groups have their own rules, laws, and conventions, and aside from the barmy and the criminal, some have spoken of groups of Darkers who have t
aken up a taste for the flesh of mortal sods who blunder into the tunnels they occupy. And some rumors tell of even stranger creatures within the darkness that these mortal ghouls themselves flee from in terror at even the hint of. Some speak of filth enc
r
usted, tentacled beings, and of warring kingdoms of cranium rats known as the Four Great Minds. [But of this, I cannot prove a word aside to say that that there are indeed massive numbers of cranium rats infesting the Realm Below, and that there is eviden
ce to suggest at least two separate factions are at war with each other, especially in the regions burrowing down below the Slags. \endash  The Editor]
\par 
\par One specific community calling itself the Dim Court exists in some of the shallower networks of tunnels beneath the Nobles District of The Lady\rquote 
s Ward. This small community is a microcosm for life within the Realm Below. They have a unique social structure, even their own terminology for themselves within their group. For example, those Darkers who possess low ligh
t or darkvision are known, within the Dim Court, as Seers. These bloods guide the others and almost never go aboveground since their eyes are so valuable to the rest of the community since no light, magical or mundane, are ever sparked within the hall of 
the court.
\par 
\par The court takes its name from the inky blackness it resides in and the pit at the center plaza of the underground community. Used as a dumping ground for refuse and trash, as well as a punishment for crimes befitting death. None of the Darkers k
now just where it leads, or just how deep the Pit is. One might speculate it simply exits to a portal or to somewhere else within the depths, and attempts to judge the depth of the Pit have recorded over a half-mile of depth without reaching any material 
bottom. [But the ring of Sigil is only so deep is it not? An open question. \endash  The Editor]
\par 
\par Perhaps the strangest, and one of the least supported rumors holds that deep beneath the Lower Ward lies the abandoned ruins of a Yugoloth citadel called the Temple o
f Darkness or the Temple of Eternal Darkness. The site was reportedly abandoned and destroyed by its occupants during the late stages of the Faction War, or destroyed by an outside agency during the same period of time. The area is still said to be cloake
d in randomly failing shreds of }{\i\f30\fs20 deeper darkness}{\f30\fs20 
 spells, littered with broken black marble and the still smoking husk of a device known as the Nightmare Shaft. Of those who have announced their intentions to find the temple deep within UnderSigil those who h
ave returned to the surface never found it. One of these groups however claim to have seen networks of elegant marble paved passages, emblazoned with runes of silver in a mix of Infernal and Abyssal. This last information is wholly unsubstantiated by any 
other reports, and the claimants either left Sigil shortly thereafter or fell heavily into their cups. But the stories do certainly suggest that at one point the \lquote 
loths did have a higher presence within the depths of Sigil. The current state of that presence is unknown in the face of scant evidence one way or the other.
