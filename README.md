An archive of Planewalker pre-2014 crash
----------------------------------------

In 2014 Planewalker suffered a catastrophic database crash that took most of our 
content at the time with it. Luckily we had a cache system running for anonymous users.
This cache was preserved and we are able to provide access to some of the old 
information in the cached format of the site. It is available at mimir.planewalker.com

This archive is presented as is. The content may not have aged well over the years.
We leave it to the reader to determine their own comfort level with the material.

Links to locations off site may have rotted over time and left no forwarding address.
This archive will not be updated to address link-rot but we hope Google and the
good services of the Internet Archive (https://archive.org/) may be able to help you.

Emails have been scrubbed from this archive for security reasons.
