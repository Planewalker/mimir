Utadas Tensar (LG male human Clr10 Fraternity of Order)
Considered one of the most honest men in Sigil, he has for years run the most respected and sought after employment service in all the city from his office in the Clerkâ€™s+Ward. His honesty and propensity for finding equally honest and skilled labor has given him a good name within the business community and thus a spot upon the Sigil Advisory Council. He has however, indicated that he is likely to step down after his current term.
