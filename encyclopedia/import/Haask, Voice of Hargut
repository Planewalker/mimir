Haask, a monstrous greathorn minotaur, conquered Ironfang Keep  of the world of Abeir-Toril in -981 of that world's Dale Reckoning calendar, declaring himself priest-king of the land of Grong-Haap. He ruled Grong-Haap for six hundred years, expanding it to include the modern lands of Thar, the eastern Moonsea, and northern highlands of the Vast.
In the Year of Craven Words (-350 DR), Haask summoned an elder+evil to combat a goblinoid horde, Hargut of the Gray Pestilence. Hargut slew tens of thousands, consigning their souls to the Gray Waste, but three humans, the mortals who would become known as Bane, Myrkul, and Bhaal, took advantage of the distraction to attack and nearly slay Haask, revealing his true form as a doppleganger of the elder batrachi race. 
As Haask lay dying, the Dark Three persuaded him to agree to a ritual that would bind him and Hargut together as one entity under the command of the three adventurers. Hargut agree, and together they became Haask, Voice of Hargut, a fell entity bound to Ironfang Keep and responsible for the creation of numerous abominations and chimerical monstrosities to this day. 
If freed, Haask, Voice of Hargut, would ally itself with Malar and Ghaunadaur, and work to exact vengeance on Bane and his church.
Haask, Voice of Hargut, is a wormlike abomination with a gargantuan mouth filled with countless rows of teeth. Its skin is a poisonous green covered in red sores, with veins and organs somewhat visible beneath. Haask survives as a symbiont attached to the outside of Hargut's body.
