Perched on the River Ma'at, Thoth's Estate is the Realm of the Egyptian Power Thoth, the ibix-headed god of knowledge and science.  It is located in the Outlands spireward of Automata and Rigus, and contains several villages and towns that dot the banks of the river Ma'at. The most remarkable feature of the realm is the Library of Thoth where it is said that an answer to any question can be found (how long that may take is another question). Directly across the river is the Burg of Thebestys, one of the largest in the Outlands. Since Thoth and the rest of his pantheon protects this area, would-be invaders are wise to think twice.
