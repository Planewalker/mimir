The Ditch is Sigil's largest body of water, a polluted swill filled with mud, refuse, raw sewage and corpses that separates the Hive Ward from the Lower Ward. It is a river in the same sense that a dead rat is still a rat. One end has a portal to the River Oceanus the Dabus open periodically to flush it out. 
There is supposed to be a monster in the Ditch, the so-called Ditch Beast.
