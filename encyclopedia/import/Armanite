Armanites are a breed of lesser Tanar'ri shaped much like Bariaurs or centaurs. They have humanoid bodies that look a little emaciated and rotten like those of ghouls or the walking dead, with massive bull-like horns; their bodies are like those of bulls, too, with spikes coming out of their spines and tails.
The leader of the largest and most successful Armanite herd is the Amber Stallion.
