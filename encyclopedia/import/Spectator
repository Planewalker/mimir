Spectators are smaller relatives of the beholders from Mechanus, often summoned to guard treasures because, like their cousins the observers, they go through long periods of contemplation (up to 101 years) where they seldom leave a small area. Their powers are less combat oriented than those of beholders but better suited to their task, and they are capable of limited planar travel.
Spectators have a large central eye and four smaller eye stalks protruding from the tops of their hovering, spherical bodies. Their biggest eye reflects spells and turns them back on their caster, while their smaller eyes create food and water, cure serious wounds, paralyze, and allow the beholder to use telepathy and magical suggestions.
Spectators are friendly for beholders, without the evil taint of most of their cousins. Many serve the deity Lendor.
