God of archery, hunting, and wilderness survival in the Seldarine, Solonor Thelandira dwells in Arvandor near the Pale Tree, a white tree with silver leaves thought to have mystical powers. His advocacy of sport hunting draws him into conflict with Rillifane Rallathil, who believes in hunting for survival only. Despite this, he strongly believes in the balance of nature, and instructs his followers to avoid sport hunting in forests Rillifane protects.
He is the brother of Fenmarel Mestarine, and is closely allied with Uller and Artemis. He despises Talos and Malar.
