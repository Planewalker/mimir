The Cat Lord is one of the Animal Lords of the Beastlands. In her human form, she looks like a dark-haired, green-eyed human with a lithe form. Her eyes are catlike, with vertical pupils. In her cat form she looks like a black panther with fiery red eyes and fierce strength. 
She tends to the affairs of cats throughout the planes, arriving whenever humans drive cats from their natural habitats, leading them out of danger by assuming leadership of the pride. The other animal lords are suspicious of her sudden, recent ascension; they don't realize her predecessor, a male, was hunted and killed in Carceri. Her claim to be ruler of all cats makes her a fierce rival of Bast.
The Cat Lord's territory in the Beastlands is in Brux, the layer of twilight. It is called the Cat Lord's Prowl, and she shares it with the goddess of weretigers, Ferrix.
The Cat Lord is also an NPC in the Greyhawk campaign setting. He is given his title because he is the alleged god of cats, though others view him as an evil being. He has been known to roam the planes to further his protection of cats and other felines. He is seen in many forms, including those of a dark skinned, black haired man; a black panther; and a hybrid form of the two. He usually wears black garp with some gold jewelry, and is very charismatic and kind to most.
He is close allies with Xan Yae.
