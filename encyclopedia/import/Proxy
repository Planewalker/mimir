A proxy is a being - Prime, Planar, or Petitioner - specially chosen to serve a Power directly. Usually they take the form of Aasimon or fiends, though some deities prefer to create personalized forms. 
A few proxies, like the Valkyries and Furies, are demipowers with a divine rank, but most are not.
