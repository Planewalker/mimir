Spirits of the air are minions of the powers of wind and air, born from their breath when they spoke words of foolish hubris at the beginning of time. 
The spirits resemble winged monkeys with black skin and tusks. They dress themselves in fine silk. They are only free between the time the gods inhale and exhale, and in that time they live complete lives, if only in their minds. 
At night, they are colorless as the moon, but in day they are weighted down with all the colors of the sun. When they die, the colors become sentient creatures born from the spirits' dreams of freedom, though they live no more than an hour or two.
