It is the belief of the Fraternity of Order that the Multiverse is ruled by certain laws and rules. It's their goal to uncover these laws: while it's true that they exist, they're certainly Dark, and it's going to take a lot of work to uncover exactly what they are. Only the highest of the factors of the Guvners even know one Axiom (that's a fundamental principle of the multiverse). 
With knowledge of an Axiom comes that knowledge of how to bend that rule... how to exploit the natural laws of the multiverse, how to slip through the cracks of existence. Of course, it isn't easy to do this... it takes years of study just to begin to grasp the logic hidden behind the discovered Axioms. The more manipulative of the members of the Fraternity of Order believe once they learn how to use the laws of the multiverse that they'll be able to do anything, overcome any obstacle... and get rid of anyone who might stand in their way.
Prior to the Faction War, the Fraternity of Order (or Guvners) was one of the three members of Sigil's Triad of Law, Justice, and Order, the other two being, of course, the Mercykillers and the Harmonium. Their role within the Triad was to run the City Courts (located in The Lady's Ward), which also served as the Faction's headquarters in the city. They were led by their dwarven Factol, Hashkar. 
Following the Faction War, the Guvners retreated to their planar headquarters in Mechanus, the Fortress of Disciplined Enlightenment, where they are led by their new factol, Jamis.
