The créche-forges are fortresslike factories on the Plane of Mechanus, the source of the inevitables. They first appeared ten thousand years ago, after the destruction of the Aphanacts.
Inevitables periodically return to their créche-forges to have their memories purged so that they can continue to serve only pure Law.
The best known créche-forge is Neumannus, though there may be another one in Rudra's realm, the Focus of Energy.
