A thousand voices, a thousand psyches, a thousand personal multiverses, a thousand overly-inflated egos: these are the Sign of One. Fragmented and splintered almost beyond recognition, the Sign of One is a group where each member imagines themselves as the center of the multiverse. Some believe that each person has a personal multiverse, but others believe that it is they who control the multiverse. They each think in some way that the multiverse is imagined, whether or not it is imagined by each person or one in particular. Some of the more "diplomatic" members of the Sign of One believe only in the power of belief and its effect on the multiverse. However, the majority of the faction is a bunch of egocentric and arrogant people that believe themselves superior to anyone else. Their headquarters in Sigil prior to the Faction War was the Hall of Speakers.
After the Faction War, the majority of the Sign of One joined forces with the Believers of the Source to form the Mind's Eye Faction, which is perhaps no more unified than the Sign of One was.
