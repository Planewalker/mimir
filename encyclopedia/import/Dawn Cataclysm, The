The Dawn Cataclysm was a godswar in the prehistory of Toril. Lathander tried to remake the pantheons of Toril in his image, with disastrous consequences. Before it ended, Tyche had been corrupted and shattered into two personas, and Murdane was dead. Doubtless many other things happened as well, but the gods are not forthcoming with details. Some things are not for mortals to know.
