A sensorium (plural: sensoriums) is a room within the Civic Festhall the Sensates use to record or experience memories stored in recorder stones. Visitors to a sensorium can experience the memories of other people as if they were their own. 
There are both Public Sensoriums open to everyone (for 20 gp each) and Sensate Sensoriums open to members of the Society of Sensation.
