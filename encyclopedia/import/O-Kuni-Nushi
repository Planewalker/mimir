O-Kuni-Nushi (also called Oh-Kuni-Nushi) is a Japanese god of heroism, medicine, sorcery, and the land. He dwells in the Realm of Kenyama in Ysgard.
Kenyama, which he shares with Hachiman, is a realm of war and heroes, built on a bit of flying rock the two gods can steer between the larger rivers of earth on the first Layer of the plane. O-Kuni-Nushi is less interested in battles than Hachiman, preferring heroic actions and adventurers. As a great lover of animals, O-Kuni-Nushi has made it so that anyone who eats meat in Kenyama vomits it back up and is cursed with the scent of carrion for days. Some say O-Kuni-Nushi stays in Kenyama to keep Hachiman company, and only their combined might keeps the realm from drifting away into more lawful planes.
