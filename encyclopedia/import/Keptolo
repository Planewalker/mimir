Keptolo (kep-toe-low) is the ideal male drow: sophisticated, witty, observant, and utterly decadent. He is capricious and untrustworthy. Zinzerena became a hero-goddess by tricking him out of a bit of his divinity.
Keptolo is the consort of Lolth; he believes in feeding her vanity for the sake of his own personal power. He dwells with her in the Demonweb Pits, catalogued as the 66th Layer of the Abyss.
