The fearsome skriaxits, also called blackstorms and living sandstorms, are spirits of retribution summoned from the Elemental Plane of Air millennia ago by ancient gods. They combine wind and sand to render mortals fleshless in minutes.
Skriaxits speak Auran and their own language, a howling, shrieking tongue that inspires terror in all who hear it. Skriaxits are intelligent and evil air+elementals, feeding on terror and destruction. They may lie dormant, dreaming for centuries at a time before striking.
They may be related to Tempests.
