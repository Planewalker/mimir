The goristroi (Singular: Goristro) are huge Tanar'ri, originally created by the Abyssal Lord Baphomet (possibly in collusion with the Abyssal Lord Pale Night) that are used as living siege engines. Goristroi appear as giant apelike creatures with the heads of bulls, much like enormous, fiendish minotaurs, or larger scale Bulezau (which were also creations of Baphomet).
