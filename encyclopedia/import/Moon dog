Moon dogs[/b] are canine celestials native to Elysium. They are devoted foes of evil. 
Moon dogs are nearly identical to lupinals in many ways, but they are slightly more animal-like, traveling on four feet more often than two. Their faces are slightly human in appearance, and their forepaws have opposable thumbs and are usable as hands. They have dark fur and amber eyes.
