Prolongers - also called Cheaters - are a Sect who believe that life is superior to the status of Petitioner, undead, or any other alternative. They avoid dying by any and all means, altering themselves so that they can use the life force of other people to keep themselves alive.
Rowan+Darkwood has had suspicious dealings with them in the past.
