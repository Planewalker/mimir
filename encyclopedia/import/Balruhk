Balruhk the Invincible was a brilliant Pit Fiend general some three centuries past. His rivals among the Baatezu arranged a pact with a mortal wizard called Yullok to bind him on the Material Plane during a battle with the Tanar'ri. Yullok convinced the Battleloth mercenaries that served with Balruhk (along with his baatezu troops) to betray him at a crucial moment. Yullok botched the spell, though, slaughtering tanar'ri, baatezu, and battleloths alike. 
Whether or not Balruhk survived the blast is unknown.
