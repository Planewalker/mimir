Glimmerfolk are natives to the material+plane that have a little bit of plane+of+radiance in them.
They are fiercely isolationist and have little contact with other
peoples. They are taller, but slighter, than humans. They have tan
skin, and almost elflike sylvan features.
Glimmerfolk are fiercly dependant on being near to a radient source, without it they cannot live for long. There are, however, some Glimmerfolk who have learned to live without this presence.
