Kylie is a highup in the 'not a faction' Faction of the Free League. Kylie is a Tiefling with red hair and a scaley tail. She has a pet Ethyk. She is generally in a good mood and talkative as befits her occupation of Tout. Like most Indeps and touts, she keeps her eyes and ears open for anything of interest. Rumors hold that she may be the grandchild of Shemeshka+the+Maruader though, so the information she finds may end up making it to other ears.
She is guildmistress of the Guild+of+Touts in Sigil post-Faction War.
