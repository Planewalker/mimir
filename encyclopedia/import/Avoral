Avorals are the scouts and skirmishers of the Guardinal race. They have a deep-rooted wanderlust that can take them across the Multiverse. Some are so curious they leave their native plane of Elysium and never return.
Avorals have tall, muscular humanoid bodies, but their arms are powerful wings and their hair is like a feathery cowl around their heads. Their eyes are bright and golden like an owl's.
In Elysium, their favored layers are Eronia and Belierin, where they spend time soaring the winds alone. Avorals are excellent hunters.
