The shadar-kai, or â€œshadow fey," are a race of bitter, determined folk whose souls have been literally poisoned by darkness. Both cursed and blessed with an affinity for shadow, they are subtle and deceptive. They steal away without being detected when they can, and strike from ambush when necessary.
Long ago, the shadar-kai sought to preserve their world from the rising human race. Skilled in shadow magic, they made a pact with a dark power of the Plane+of+Shadow (rumors say it was Erebus) to cast the world into an eternal twilight in which the shadow fey would rule supreme. But the experiment went awry somehow, leaving the fey bound to the Plane of Shadow, cursed to eventually lose their souls to its dark depths. This curse affects the shadar-kai to this day, and everyone of them is engaged in a life-long struggle to stave off the inevitable doom.
