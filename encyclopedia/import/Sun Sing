Sun Sing is a formless evil entity who dwells on the Quasielemental Plane of Vacuum. Eons ago, when the obyriths were first exploring the planes, they came across Sun Sing, whose power followed them back to the+Abyss, creating portals to the Quasielemental Plane of Vacuum that plague the Abyss to this day.
The agents of Sun Sing are said to be combing the planes for the pieces of some puzzle.
