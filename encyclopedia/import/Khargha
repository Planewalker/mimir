Khargra are creatures from the Elemental Plane of Earth. They are called “earth fish” or even “earth birds” by the Clueless, and they are used as ore-snoops by the Dao. They hatch from an egg and mature on Elemental Earth, but as they age, they slowly migrate to Quasielemental+Mineral – this destination appears to be some kind of a final reward for them. 
Khargras are feet long cylindrical creature covered in large metallic
scales. Three large flexible metal fins are spaced evenly around their
bodies.
