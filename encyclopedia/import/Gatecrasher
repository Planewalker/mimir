Gatecrasher is a prestige class found in the 3rd edition Manual of the Planes. The gatecrashers see themselves as cosmic free agents, independent forces who can influence the natives of the planes and even the dynamic forces of magic itself. They are the tricksters of the multiverse, often testing the valiant, derailing the grasping, and deflating the egotistical. Their instinctive understanding of the nature of the universe allows them to perform actions that would otherwise be beyond them. Gatecrashers see what they do as an art, not a science. The ability to choose the right moment to strike, the correct word to utter, the right rock to move, is more intuition than conscious thought. Gatecrashers can come from any class, although many learned the mischievous attitude of a gatecrasher when they were rogues or bards. Gatecrashers can be found among other planar travelers usually picking at the fabric of the universe and seeing what unravels.
