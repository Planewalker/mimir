Fireshadows are creatures of death and destruction that dwell in the+Abyss. They are sometimes summoned by evil clerics to participate in dark schemes as assassins or guardians. 
A fireshadow assumes whatever shape specified by the cleric who summoned it, although it is always thirty feet in height and formed of cold, green flame. Fireshadows have appeared as wraith-like dragons, towering human warriors, and immense skeletons, wreathed in pale green fire.
A fireshadow cannot speak, but is able to communicate telepathically with the cleric who summoned it.
