Arctines are small, humanoid-shaped elementals of ice and cold, inhabiting naturally occuring icebergs on the border of the Elemental Plane of Water and Paraelemental+Plane+of+Ice. They have innate psionic powers and can put out fires with a touch. They are friendly and eager to help those in need.
Their bodies are ice-white and transluscent, and their enormous eyes look like melted snow.
