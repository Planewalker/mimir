Caibre is a god of bards and music in the Celtic Pantheon, occasionally playing at the courts of Nuada and Manannan.
He is a lesser deity, but too light-hearted to take seriously things such as holy days, services, and sacrifices. He views his worshippers with a certain amount of bewildered amusement.
