A klurichir is a form of guardian Tanar'ri. They act as the right hands of the Lords of the Abyss, and even a Balor will give one wide berth. They have four arms, wings, a hideous bristled boar's head, and an enormous maw that dominates their torsos, filled with fangs and drool and surrounded by mighty pinchers like those of an insect.
