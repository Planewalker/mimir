While the upper class lives in The Lady's Ward, the lower class in the Lower Ward, and the destitute class in the Hive Ward, the Guildhall Ward is the part of Sigil where the middle class makes its home. It's filled with hundreds of ethnic neighborhoods, each attempting to preserve its culture in Sigil's hubbub.
Long ago, before the Great Upheaval, the Guildhall Ward was home to Sigil's guilds - the Freemen, Leatherworkers, Alchemists, and Planewalkers. After the factions were stabilized at just fifteen, they made it their business to drive the guilds out of business. 
Most of the merchants in the Market Ward live in the Guildhall Ward. In addition, the Guildhall Ward is filled with such professions that can't be physically sold - solicitors, doctors, schools of philosophy. In the center of the whole thing is the Great Gymnasium, the ward's main attraction, a giant building built around three grand public baths. A soothing building of marble and gold, the Gymnasium is home of the Ward's only faction, the Transcendant+Order - who seek unity of mind and body. The Ciphers run about the Ward and the Gymnasium, training themselves to the vigors of balance between action and though, performing the duty of their faction.
Since the Faction War, Sigil's guilds have begun to return, filling the void left by the fleeing factions. How long they'll be able to remain in a city where philosophy and power are one, however, is questionable.
