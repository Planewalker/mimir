Baftis is a quiet, subservient consort, more than a little
afraid of her hideous lord, Triel+the+Fallen. She rarely acts on her own behalf without
specific permission. She appears as a 9' tall, attractive, but rather
forbidding human female, save for her spired horns, batlike
wings, crimson skin, and hooves. She has no tail, and her eyes are of
an unusual lavender hue. She wars loose, open robes, covering her
ivory-hued back (which she is sensitive about).
