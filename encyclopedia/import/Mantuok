A were-rat the voice of Many-As-One, the cranium rat collective,
is an ingratiating little bastard whose best quality is that he is
subservient to those with power. He's also a mage of some talent, and
it seems he'll sell out his master to achieve an advantage for himself.
He seems to hate you with a passion. Perhaps he's jealous of you.
