Brihaspati is the teacher of the Vedic powers, the lord of prayer, and the heavenly priest. He is wisdom incarnate, and it was he who taught Indra the arts of government so that he could lead the gods when the Aryans first entered India. In order to teach his fellow gods the virtues of secular life, he wrote a treatise on married life, and he personally guided the hand of the worldly priests who wrote ancient law code that bears his name. In his true form, Brihaspati has seven mouths, a set of sharp horns, a hundred wings, and is usually armed with both an axe and a bow.
Brihaspati is primarily concerned with teaching men to live well and wisely. He often sends his avatars to act as advisors to worthy rajas. Brihaspati has also been known to send an avatar to particularly cruel or inept rajas, hoping to teach them the error of their ways. Omens from Brihaspati come in the form of sudden insights and realizations.
His Realm in Lunia is called the Nectar of Life. Nectar of Life is a serene and quiet land with a few forests, vineyards, and orchards and narrow gorges near the coast. Its towns and fortresses are sheltered in gorges and valleys. The largest town is Omyriel, where the library Katsudarma can be found, watched over by the Warden Archon who calls himself the Lamplighter. Every bit of knowledge known to Brihaspati's worshipers can be found written down on one of the scrolls of the realm. Bahamut's realm occasionally becomes a feature of Nectar of Life, appearing within a thundering waterfall called the Maiden's Veil.
