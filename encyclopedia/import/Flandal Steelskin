Flandal Steelskin, also called the Master of Metal, Lord of Smiths and the Pyromancer, is the gnomish Power of mining and smithing (of all types). He is the strongest of the Lords+of+the+Golden+Hills and is able to sniff out veins of any ore. As such, he is the patron of gnomish warriors, miners and metalworkers. He is friendly with all the gnomish gods save the evil Urdlen as well as Moradin, a fellow metalworking power. His realm, the Mithral Forge, is located in Bytopia in the Golden Hills. He shares it with Ama-Tsu-Mara of the Japanese pantheon.
