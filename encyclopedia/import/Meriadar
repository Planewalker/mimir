Meriadar[/b] is the patron Power of mongrelfolk, a race that resemble melange of dozens of humanoid creatures. 
Meriadar lives in Arcadia, in his Realm, The Hand of Peace, on the Layer of Buxenus, where he teaches patience and respect to all creatures. His realm is a refuge of sorts from the often intolerant Arcadian militias.
