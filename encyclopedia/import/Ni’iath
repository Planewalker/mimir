Ni'iath (both singular and plural) are wormlike creatures with vicious mouths and four narrow eyes spaced equidistantly about their heads. Small arms with clawed fingers sprout from either side and their tails end in a whiplike barb. They swim through the air between the two layers of Bytopia, ignoring gravity. They resemble particularly cunning wolves in mentality.
