The Anarch's Guild is a Sect headquarted in the Floating City of the Githzerai and is composed almost entirely of that race. It's an organization that trains anarchs in chaos-shaping. 
It is under the control of Zaerith Menyar Ag-Gith, the githzerai wizard-king. 
The Anarch's Guild should not be confused with the Anarchists faction.
