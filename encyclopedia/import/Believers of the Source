The Believers of the Source are one of the most open-minded groups in Sigil towards the multiverse. They believe that anyone can become a god, even if you were borne ugly, with a horrible defacing scar, or if you're just plain nasty. There is divinity within us all. They say that this divinity is called The Source, from which all life in existence springs from and is endowed with the innate desire to return to it. 
The only way to feel the Source, say the Godsmen, is to advance along the path of existence, climbing higher and higher until one is almost on level with it. To feel its energies coursing through your body, to feel on the level of its power... this is what it is to be a deity. To assume the mantle of godhood is to become as close to the Source as one possibly can while remaining an individual... it's said that to ascend beyond the state of 'power' is to reach union with The Source, thus beginning their cycle over again on the karmic wheel. 
The Believers of the Source were a faction with headquarters in the Great Foundry in Sigil. Following the Faction War, they merged with the Sign of One to form a new Faction, the Mind's Eye.
