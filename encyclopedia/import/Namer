Namers, also called 'the file,' are often Faction members in name only. They usually have no official link to the faction other than stating their allegience to their chosen factions thinking, though in some groups - like the Fraternity of Order and the Harmonium - they may be employed by the faction in menial capacity.Â  Most adventurers are namers, since adventuring is a full-time job in itself, but some adventurers like the idea of gaining political power in their factions and aspire to higher rank. Namers can say no to any request from their faction, but opportunities for advancement will likely be closed to them in the future.
Individual factions may have other names for their namers. The Guvners call them 'aides,' while in the Harmonium they're referred to as 'notaries' once they've completed their training in Buxenus.
