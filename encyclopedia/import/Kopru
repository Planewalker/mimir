The koprus are a race of serpentine, tentacle-headed amphibians fond of hot or boiling, sulfurous waters in the tropics. Thousands of years ago they ruled a great undersea empire, but a plague and a slave rebellion, coupled with their ongoing rivalry with the ixitxachitls, caused the collapse of their civilization.
Koprus worship the Elder Evil Shothotugg as well as Prukal, the Dark Globe, and Demogorgon, Prince of Demons.
