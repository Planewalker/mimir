Squerrik, lord of wererats, lives in Cheisin, an endless series of burrows and tunnels, infested with traps, in Gehenna, below the surface of Khalas. He is a fearful creature, ever searching for protections to keep his enemies at bay (not that he has many; he's a bit paranoid).
Squerrik is every bit as evil as Daragor and Eshebala, but his evil is more organized and his trickster slyness makes him exceedingly dangerous.
