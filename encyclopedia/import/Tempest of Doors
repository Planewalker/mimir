After the Faction War, all the portals of Sigil rearranged themselves according to the will of the Lady of Pain. This destroyed some businesses that had depended on certain portals, while creating new opportunities to others. It left the City of Doors unfavored by planar merchants for a time, as they had to rethink the routes they used to reach the city, and it stranded some Cagers inside while they figured out how to get where they needed to go.
