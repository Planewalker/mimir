Sheyruushk is the underwater Realm of Sekolah in Baator's Layer of Stygia and is accessible from a crack between two icebergs not too far from Tantlin. The icy waters are dark, but that does not bother the sharklike sahuagin who live here. The sea devils cavort in the court of, Sekolah, their deity. Awful rites pay homage to the brutal shark deity in which captive Baatezu feature prominently as sacrifices. Sharks of every size and every type constantly roam the waters of Sheyruushk, though both the sharks and sahuagin often swim up into the River Styx. They love to sink River Styx merchant craft as well as the boats of the marraenoloths. Sekolah's blessing is sufficient to render the raiders immune to the influence of the waters of Styx for a short time.
