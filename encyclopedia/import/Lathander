Lathander is a greater deity of Toril. He is neutral good. He shares his Realm in Eronia, Morninglory, with Ushas of the Indian Pantheon and Zodal of Oerth, and is sometimes visited there by Atroa. Morninglory is tinted with the colors of dawn - rubies, crimsons, yellows, and pinks. A small mountain lake bordered by a meadow and a stand of tall timber form Lathander's cathedral here. Sleep and similar spells do not function within Lathander's domain, but creatures who rest here find themselves refreshed in half the normal time.
Lathander's portfolio includes athletics, beginnings, birth, conception, creativity, dawn, eternal youth, renewal, self-perfection, Spring, vitality, and youth.
