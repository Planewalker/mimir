Time dimensionals, also misnamed time elementals, are intelligences composed entirely of the essence of time. They can be found in the Demiplane+of+Time. They exist in all times simultaneously, and can appear in numerous places at once. At least one of them has a relationship of some sort with the goddess Istus.
