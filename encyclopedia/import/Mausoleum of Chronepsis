The Mausoleum of Chronepsis lies within a great cave found in hidden ruins on the Outlands and serves as the Realm of Chronepsis, the dragon Power of fate. Within, the dragon god watches the multitudes of hour-glasses that can be found throughout. Each hour-glass represents the life of a dragon and every dragon throughout the Multiverse has an hour-glass somewhere in the Mausoleum, slowly dropping its granuals of sand, counting down the life of that dragon.
