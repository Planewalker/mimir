Hutijin is a baatezu+noble in the service of Mephistopheles. He commands two companies of pit+fiends in his lord's service. These pit fiends are the aristocracy of Cania, and Hutijin is one of the greatest of the dukes of Baator.
Hutijin closely resembles a pit fiend himself, though he is in fact a greater being. His head is larger than a pit fiend's, proportionately, and his wings are smaller. His hide is a dark rust-red color.
