Scyllans are descendents of Scylla, an ancient fiendish sea monster (perhaps even one of the Lords of the Nine), a being with six serpentine heads sprouting from her neck. Scyllans are lesser fiends native to Stygia; they have only one head each, but many tentacles. A scyllan is about 20 feet tall, if you could stand one up on dry land, and weighs 10,000 pounds.
