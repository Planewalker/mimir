Like the Xag-ya, spiritovores are energons native to the Positive+Energy+Plane. Like crystal+screamers, they subsist to some extent on preincarnate souls.
Soulsippers are 10-foot-long creatures of energy, strangely fishlike in shape. They have wormlike tendrils where a fish's eyes would be. They apparently fill some mysterious fertilization role in the development of mortal souls. They sing soothing songs to calm their foes.
Soulmarauders have bodies like manta rays, but like other energons they're composed of incorporeal energy rather than flesh. Soulmarauders hunt soulsippers and other energons, but can survive on preincarnate souls if they must.
Soulscapers are four-armed, vaguely humanoid giants composed of brilliant energies. They have godlike intelligence and prodigious spell-like abilities. They tend to gardens of preincarnate life as druids tend to their forests. They can command any lesser energon, including soulsippers, soulmarauders, and xag-ya.
