Fensir, also called Ysgardian trolls, frequent the first and third layers of Ysgard. Despite their name, they are nothing like prime+material trolls. Fensir wear only simple clothing. While some are hideously ugly, many fensir have a basic human appearance. They have larger ears and noses than humans, and have grey-brown, earth-coloured skin. Their skin is tough and leathery. Fensir average between 6 and 8 feet in height, although females regularly exceed that norm.
