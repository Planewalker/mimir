Soulforged items are created by the Archons of Mount Celestia. Armor made this way is brilliant silver in color. Though gold is a common element in the fi ligree and decorative designs that highlight these items, the metal turns white because of the itemâ€™s incredible purity. In addition, the surfaces of soulforged armor and shields, if they are held at just the right angle, bear traceries reminiscent of the feathers of archon wings. Though this design feature is not added intentionally, it is always present. The celestial smiths who craft soulforged items focus on power and steadfast resolution in the overall design.
Soulforged weapons feature the same silver sheen and feathery pattern as soulforged armor and shields. In addition, a distant hymn of praise to the forces of good is audible with each swing of the weapon.
