Utu is the Sumerian god of the sun. His title is the Unbalanced. He dwelled in Mechanus until the death of Enki, where - now out of Enki's watchful eye - he moved his Realm, the Absorbing Light, into Arborea. His realm is a dazzling yellow glow that kills undead forces all living beings who move within it to merge with the god, who is too busy fighting with his own mind to prevent it. 
He is a greater deity. His symbol is a radiant sun disc. His sacred animal is the falcon, his color is orange, and he asks for a sacrifice of magical weapons annually, during a solar eclipse.
