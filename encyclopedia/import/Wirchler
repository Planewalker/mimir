Wirchlers are native to the fiery layers of Gehenna; they resemble ravenous mouths with scrawny, hairy arms. They pay precious fire-gems to Night Hags in return for Larvae to torture.
Wirch is also a verb denoting their special attack, stimulating the pain centers of their victims by rubbing their teeth together. This is only possible in groups of four or more.
