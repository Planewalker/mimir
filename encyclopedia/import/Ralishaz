Ralishaz, the Unlooked For, is a god of chance, misfortune, and madness worshipped on Oerth. He is a shapechanger, constantly changing form and gender, alternately beautiful and hideous. Despite his unpleasant associations, he is chaotic neutral, not evil. He is allied with Kurell, but Norebo despises him and Rudd opposes him. His Realm in Limbo is called the Kiss of Luck.
