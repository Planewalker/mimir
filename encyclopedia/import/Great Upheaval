Over six hundred years ago, there were roughly fifty-two factions in Sigil. Few were as organized or as large as the factions today, but they were powerful enough to engage in the kriegstanz. The conflict was so intense that fierce battles became common in the streets, catching both factioneers and bystanders in the crossfire. With several factions espousing fanatical or opposing viewpoints, it seemed the war wouldn't end until one side managed to wipe out all the opposition. However, the Lady of Pain brought an abrupt end to the conflict, making her will known by sending her servants, the Dabus, to each faction with a message:
"By the order of the Lady of Pain, there will be but fifteen factions in Sigil. Organize thy colors in a fortnight - or die."
After two weeks of turmoil the number of factions within Sigil had dropped to fifteen. Some fled Sigil, while others dissolved entirely. The stubborn died horribly, presumably at the hand of the Lady of Pain, indirectly or otherwise. Over ten thousand died, and it seemed the kriegstanz had finally ended with what would become known as the Great Upheaval. It had simply entered a new phase, however, as the remaining factions gradually took control of Sigil's institutions and competed for control of the city.
