Dazhbog, the son of Svarog, is the sun god in the Slavic Pantheon. He is lawful good. He rides across the sky in a chariot made of diamond. His cult is rapidly overshadowing the cult of Ukko.
Dazhbog inherited his father's holy symbol, a symmetrical cross inscribed within a circle, and his title, the Bright Sun.
