Bueroza, or steel devils, form the lowest levels of the noncommissioned ranks of the Baatezu
infantry. They are found more often in the sergeantâ€™s position than the
oft-mentioned Barbazu. As they are more cunning and intelligent than
barbazu, they also make suitable honor guards for the minor nobles of
Hell. 
Bueroza look like withered, armored men with webs of steel.
