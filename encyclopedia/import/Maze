The Lady of Pain may at times imprison individuals or entire factions within ethereal mazes, spinning off sections of her city and causing them to repeat in unpredictable ways, then tailoring the maze to reflect the crime.Â The night hag Ravel was imprisoned in a maze of thorns after attempting to take control of Sigil (from Plugin &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Not Found). The Communal faction is said to still be in a maze, somehow, and the factol of the Expansionists was imprisoned in a maze for hundreds of years; he survived there, not aging a day until he finally found his way free. As a result of the Faction War many factols were mazed.
