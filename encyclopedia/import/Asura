Asuras are chaotic good celestials, bitter rivals of the Aasimon. They have fiery wings and the talons of eagles. They are prophets and divine messengers and fanatic opponents of evil. They commonly travel in hosts, offering their services to whatever deity will take them. Lone asuras have been known to go mad.
When Archons slip from the path of Law (but remain Good) they are transformed into asuras.
