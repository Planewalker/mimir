Anarchs are people with a natural ability to shape the raw chaos of Limbo without conscious effort. Simply by remaining alive, they can maintain a stable, habitable region in the tumultuous soup of the plane. Non-anarchs find the stable areas they create with their imagination and will dissipate when they fall asleep or otherwise unconscious; anarchs have no such problem.
Anarchs can be trained to further extend their abilities by the Anarch's Guild. People can be anarchs without belonging to the Anarch's Guild.
They should not be confused with the Anarchists faction.
