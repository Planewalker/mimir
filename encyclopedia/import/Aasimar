An aasimar is a humanoid with a bit of Celestial ancestry. They can result from any sort of celestial ancestor, including Eladrin, guardinals, Archons, asuras, or the Aasimon, from whom they derive their name.
Aasimar have a variety of unhuman features depending on what sorts of celestials make up their ancestry; they can be as varied as tieflings, their lower planar equivalents. Typical features include golden eyes, pointed ears, small wings, beautiful horns, emerald skin, or a light covering of fur.
Aasimar gain from their ancestry a great deal of respect and trust from good souls. Because of the innate goodness within them, they seldom abuse this trust, but just as there are good tieflings there are evil aasimar who have twisted their heritage into a tool for their own selfish ends.
