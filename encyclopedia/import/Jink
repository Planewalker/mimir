Jink[/b] is the Cant term for money. Any currency can be called jink. The Merkhants believe that jink is the most important force in the planes. That might go a little far, but no one can doubt the power money has even in the planes of gods, angels, demons, and heroes. But, of course, jink is only as valuable as it's believed to be, proving that belief is the truest power.
Gold coins in Sigil are sometimes called jinx.
Also used as a light curse when spoken.
"She jinxed you with that baatorian coin, clueless"
