The Sodkillers [/b]are of a mind that any dilemma can be resolved with force. Might makes right. And since they see themselves as being mighty, they see themselves as being right. The more cynical of the Mercykillers (or simply the meaner ones) who didn’t think that the Sons of Mercy’s way would work decided if Arwyl+Swan’s+Son was going to revive an old faction, so were they. This time they wouldn’t make the mistake of sharing the reins of power with anyone, much less annoying idealistic do-gooders like the Sons of Mercy. Now they hire themselves out as mercenaries, proving their philosophy works. They’ve already cemented themselves in Sigil behind the cover of the Minder’s+Guild, biding their time until the factions regain their status. When that time comes, they’ll seize their goals with all of their might until they have everything they want in their grasp.
