Brimir is a frost giant who belongs to the Ring-Giver faction. He owns a beer-hall called Okalnir in Jotunheim. During the winter it closes, and Brimir hibernates on top of his beer kegs. During the other months, giants come to wrestle, boast, and drink themselves senseless. Anyone who can keep up with the giants' pace is welcome.
