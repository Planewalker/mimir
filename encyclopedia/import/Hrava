Hrava is a Shadow demon, the little voice in the heads of the addle-coved citizens of Bedlam, who insinuates itself in their dreams and gives them advice, seldom showing itself directly.  
He formed a group of mercenaries called the Sarex, gangs of madmen who strike at his enemies where there's no witnesses, leaving a sign to remind others who's really in charge of the town.
