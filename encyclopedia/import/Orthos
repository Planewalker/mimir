Orthos is a being of uncountable age, having existed so long ago that its seal has appeared in some ancient civilizations. It exists outside the commonly purveyed reality, as a displaced soul called a Vestige. Nobody is sure of what Orthos was before it became a vestige, but given its appearance and entrance when summoned, it is named the Sovereign of the Howling Dark.
