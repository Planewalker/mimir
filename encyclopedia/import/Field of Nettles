The Field of Nettles[/b], one of the major battlefields of the Blood War, first came into use as two squadrons of fiends fought it out for possession of 90,000 square miles of wasteland, bluffs, and nettles (the Field is 300 miles to a side). 
Stuck between two tributaries of the River Styx in Oinos, the first Layer of the Gray Waste, the Field became a standard staging point for the war, and it’s a rare year that doesn’t see a battalion or two march through in an attempt to seize the land. Bodies piled high, and the Field rapidly became a major scavenging center for those who follow the battles of the Blood War.
