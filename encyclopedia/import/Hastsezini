Hastsezini, also known simply as Fire, delights in destroying settlements that neglect to sacrifice food and fresh meat to him. The Great+Spirit has given him the ability to destroy anyone living, and he prefers this duty to his other one, that of providing light and warmth to those who lack it. He manifests as a tall man with skin the color of pitch and an ugly hawk's head, or as a human-shaped flame. He is lawful evil, one of the most popular deities worshipped by the Efreeti nobility. In the City of Brass his mosque is a pyramid of reddish-gold copper.
Hastsezini has a realm on the Elemental+Plane+of+Fire, though he is often found in the Beastlands and the Upper and Lower World, which are demiplanes connected to the Beastlands.
