The inner planes are the planes of elemental substance and energy. The four main inner planes are Fire, Water, Air, and Earth, and the Positive energy and Negative energy planes. The elemental planes combine to form the Paraelemental Planes, and the elemental planes and energy planes merge to form the Quasielemental Planes. In the Planescape Cosmology, the Inner Planes all border the Ethereal Plane.
Elementals and Mephits are the primary form of life in the Inner Planes. Depending on the plane, other forms of life may exist. The four main elemental planes are ruled over by the four elemental rulers (Kossuth, Istishia, Akadi, and Grumbar), and the Archomentals, one good and one bad for each plane (Cyronax is the odd man out, as he rules a paraelemental plane). Genies are also major power players in the Inner Planes. On some planes, mephits claim to have dominance over the plane, but they are most often simply ignored by other races.
