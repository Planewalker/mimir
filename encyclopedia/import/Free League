The Free League, or Indeps, is one of the 15 factions of Sigil...but only because they have to be. They don't consider themselves a faction, and don't give a lick really about what the other factions have to say. They're free spirited and against supreme authority.
The Harmonium is their biggest enemy. Also there seems to be a strange disease that effects only Indeps who enter Sigil, killing them is weeks, although only a fraction of the faction contract it.
The Free League is stationed at the Great Bazaar in the Market Ward of Sigil, where free trade reigns. They also hold informal meetings in the Gate-town of Tradegate in the Outlands.
Their faction symbol is a dragon eating itself.
