Susanoo, or Susanowo, is storm god and lord of the seas in the Japanese Pantheon. He was one of the first children of Izanami and Izanagi and the brother of Amaterasu and Tsuki-Yomi. He is brash, impetuous, forthright, and completely unpredictable.
He has been banished to Limbo, where he travels in a spherical vault filled with salt water, storms, and all manner of sea creatures. The vault sweeps through the plane, wrecking attempts by mortals to establish order or even solid ground.
