Most derro worship Diirinka, a deity of magic and cruelty. He was once part of the Dwarven Pantheon, but he was banished after he betrayed his brother Diinkarazan to Ilsensine, running away after he had stolen arcane knowledge from Ilsensine's caverns. He is said to have used this knowledge to create the derro, or at least twist and manipulate them, creating the first of their sorcerous savants. 
He takes the form of a wizened derro lich. His Realm in Phlegethon, the third Layer of Pandemonium, is called Hidden Betrayal.
