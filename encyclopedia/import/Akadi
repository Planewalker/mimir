Akadi is queen of the Elemental spirits of air, the full force of wind, storm, and breeze. Her titles include Queen of the Air and Lady of the Winds. She dwells on the Elemental Plane of Air in the center of a whirlwind in the center of a primal maelstrom.
Like the other Elemental Rulers, she is alien and aloof. She teaches lessons about constant travel, speed, and flight. She is diametrically opposed to Grumbar, who is slow and resistant to change.
