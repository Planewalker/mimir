Legend says Eligor was once a half-elf dragonslayer that was so good at his job, Tiamat came before the Seldarine and demanded his soul after death.  She threatened to order dragons to attack elves without mercy unless the elven gods gave her Eligor's so, and the Seldarine capitulated.
Tiamat supposedly returned Eligor to life, convincing him to fight on behalf of dragonkind as revenge for his abandonment by his gods.  When a lone member of the Seldarine came to retrieve him from Tiamat (which god it was is unknown), Eligor and the god fought.  Once again, Eligor was killed; this time, no god would claim him, and he became a Vestige.
