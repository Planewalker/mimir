Kiputytt√∂ was goddess of sickness and Mother of the Plague in the Finnish Pantheon, a sister of Loviatar and daughter of Tuoni and Tuonetar. She appeared as a black skinned, twisted old crone with a scarred face. Her realm in Carceri was a gloomy, marshy place, dark despite the ever-present glow of the plane, and cold. Disease was carried on its winds, so those that approached did so at the risk of gout, ulcers, or the plague.
She was killed by Talona, who has taken on her portfolio and appearance. One obscure myth*, however, claims that Loviatar won her sister's freedom from the land of the dead, but only during the summer months. During the winter, she dies again.
