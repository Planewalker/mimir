Earth Elementals [/b]are originally, of course, from the plane+of+Earth. They are normally seen as hulking masses of dirt, stone and sometimes crystal or gems, with cold featureless faces and (sometimes) two eyes that sparkle like brilliant, multifaceted gems. Their language, Terran, sounds like the silence of deep tunnels, the rumblings of earthquakes, and the grinding of stone on stone. 
Though they travel slowly, they are relentless in the fulfillment of their appointed tasks. They can travel through solid rock as if it were air, but cannot swim. Their "boss" is Grumbar.
