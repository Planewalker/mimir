Earth weirds are elemental+weirds with a cold, calculating mindset. They are foretellers of death and doom. They can pronounce an individual's impending fate or foretell the apocalypse. They are also prognosticators of wealth and fortune. They seek emblems of finality or the bounty of the earth as gifts - skulls of thousand-year-old liches or stones that have never seen light.
They resemble beautiful humanoid women with sparkling gemstones for eyes and hair the brown color of earth streaked with veins of silver and gold. Their lower bodies are shifting columns of stone. 
The immature forms of earth weirds look like serpents made from earth and soil. They tend to be solitary and territorial. On the Elemental Plane of Earth they often ally with Pech tribes.
