Kukul is the Ancient Father of the Gods in the pantheon of Maztica. A being of pure gold, he is said to have made the other powers in the pantheon.
Kukul is believed to be dead, his heart giving out when he learned of strife between his sons. If this is the case, the gigantic husk of his being now drifts through the void of the Astral Plane. There are surely some who would give much for such a quantity of precious metal, embued with the remaining energies of a Power, no less.
