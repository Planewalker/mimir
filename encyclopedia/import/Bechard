Bechard is an Obyrith lord, called the Lord of Tempests, the former ruler of the realm of Yeenoghu. He was betrayed by the Tanar'ri and his connection to the layer was severed; since then, he has lain dying on the shore like a beached whale, his control over weather gone wild, creating endless hurricanes beyond even his control. 
Bechard was succeeded by the fallen celestial Azael.
Bechard is also the name of a Pit Fiend serving Mephistopheles.
