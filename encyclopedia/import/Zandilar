Zandilar the Dancer was an elven goddess (of the now-dead Yuir pantheon), the mother of Selvetarm, who was born from her brief union with Vhaeraun. When her elven followers were being wiped out by drow, she seduced Vhaeraun in an attempt to gain information from him. He betrayed and imprisoned her, and Zandilar only escaped with the help of Bast.
Zandilar was forced to merge with Bast to avoid dying altogether. They became a single deity, Sharess.
