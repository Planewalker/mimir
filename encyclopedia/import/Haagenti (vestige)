Haagenti was a shapeshifting hill giant sorceress who transformed into a beautiful frost giant so that she could bear the children of Thrym. Thrym cursed her and their sons, transforming them into the first minotaurs. The incestuous coupling between Haagenti and her sons resulted in the minotaur race.
Haagenti forswore beauty forevermore, and because every plane is beautiful to someone, became a Vestige.
Haagenti is also the name of a presumedly unrelated Abyssal+lord, the Lord of Alchemy.
