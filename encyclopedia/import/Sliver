Slivers are celestials, feminine spirits made of moonlight and flame, servants of the goddess Sel√ªne. They are guardians of the Gates of the Moon and the Infinite Staircase.
They are sometimes confused with the shards, the seven mighty Planetars who also serve Selune. These special planetars closely resemble the slivers in appearance.
The slivers and the lillends tolerate each other, but they are not truly allies.
