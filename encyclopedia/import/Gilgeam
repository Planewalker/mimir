Gilgeam, the son of Enlil, was a god-king of intermediate power who ruled the kingdom of Unther on the planet Abeir-Toril in the Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting.  After the Time of Troubles, Gilgeam was judged cruel and neglectful of his subjects by Ao and reduced to the status of a demigod.  As a result, both his avatar and his true form were destroyed by Tiamat.
