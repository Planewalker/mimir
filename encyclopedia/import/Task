Known as the Taker and Holder, and as the Wrester, Task is the draconic god of greed. While Astilabor is the goddess of acquisition (with no taint of evil), Task is the god of pure greed. He is worshipped by many evil dragons, and even some brass dragons. Tiamat also claims the portfolio of greed, however.
His lair in Pandemonium is said to hold the largest and richest hoard in the Multiverse, though worshippers of Astilabor dispute this.
