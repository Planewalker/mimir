One day Zeus developed a terrible headache. To relieve it, Hephaestus used his axe to split the mighty god’s head open. Out came Athena, full grown and fully armed. She quickly became Zeus’ favorite daughter, and is the greek Power of noble combat, architecture, sculpture, spinning, weaving, horses, ox olives, prudence, and wise counsel. As a warrior goddess she is the protectress of Athens and other cities throughout the Multiverse, but she is no less skilled in the arts of peace, inventing the potter’s wheel, teaching men to tame horses, and helping them build the great ship Argos. In her true form, Athena is a helmeted, statuesque woman of great beauty. She is often seen bearing her father’s shield, Aegis, or with an owl perched on her shoulder.
Athena is a chaste warrior who resists any attempts on her honor with force. Even seeing Athena without her clothes will be punished by blindness (no save allowed). She is the protectress of Athens, and will always send her avatar to help if that Anthill is threatened. Omens from Athena are usually delivered by owls.
She resides with the rest of the Olympians in Olympus.
