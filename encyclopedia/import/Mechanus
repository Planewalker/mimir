"The perfect synthesis of world and machine, this plane is constructed of an infinite number of gears and cogs, connected by an ever-turning array crankshafts, axles and rotors. Where the machine is kept oiled and greased it runs smooth and quiet, with only the gentle creak of metal rubbing against metal and the pungent smell of mechanical lubricant to remind a cutter he's anywhere odd. Oh, and the view -- even a hardened planewalker draws a sharp breath when he first claps eyes on Mechanus." - Quoted from www.Mimir.net
Mechanus, also known as the Clockwork Universe, Nirvana, and the Land of Cogs and Gears, is a Lawful Neutral plane. In the Great Wheel it is situated on the exact opposite side as Limbo. 
Tick, tock, tick, tock: Mechanus turns around the clock. The plane actually looks like nothing more than the insides of a giant engine. Some say this place is the source of time and motion, or at least a multiversal regulator. Well, if it's regulations you're after, Mechanus has more than enough to spare. It's the Plane of Perfect Law, and hence the home of the Modrons, Inevitables, and the Guvners. Formians are often seen here as well, especially lately.
The Petitioners of Mechanus is known to be hard-working and diligent, with little patience for anything but conducting their given tasks.
