Duprak Jarneesh, one of Sigil's Golden+Lords, a cleric of the Power Puchan, and self-titled 'Lord of Wealth', is often seen as one of the more ruthless of his kind in The Lady's Ward. Duprak has built a massive fortune on his own, and also fueled by the tithes of followers of his deity and others who simply wish to curry favor (either his, or his deity's, or both).
Duprak intends to construct Sigil's first temple to Puchan, and much of the tithes he takes in are claimed to be going to such, but many among Sigil's elite and knights+of+the+post suspect that eventually Duprak will simply vanish with most of the funds, abandoning Sigil and his followers alike.
Oddly enough, they're all wrong, and Duprak has been for some time intentionally sullying his own name in order to ferret out the identities of many of the more notorious knights+of+the+post whom he feels are unduly harming the people of Sigil. What money he has collected from his faithful will eventually go towards building a temple, but the for the moment is simply held in trust to cement his status as a Golden Lord long enough to expose those corrupt souls of the Cross-trade who are rapidly viewing him as one of them.
