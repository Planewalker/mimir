Metzli, the Lady of the Night, is goddess of the moon, night, and animal growth in the Aztec Pantheon. She is the kindly patron of growth, but also the terrible mistress of cold damp air, ghosts, and other fearful shapes and shadows. She is said to have brought life into the world by throwing a leper on a bonfire, then walking into the flames herself.
Her avatar is an albino female warrior armed with a sword of white metal that cuts through any armor. In her home, which is physically on the moon of her world, she is a beautiful, ghostly woman made of silver light.
