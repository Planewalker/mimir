Descendents of wicked members of an inferior order of Jann, the great ghuls[/b] are genies who have become undead. They are usually female, and all great ghuls are beguiling and seductive shapeshifters. The only clue to their true nature is their feet, which resemble the hooves of asses. 
In their true form, ghuls have clawed hands, hooved feet, and thick hair. Their skin is corpse-pale, corpse-cold and clammy, and they have the hunched posture and feral look of the ghouls, their mortal equivalents. They range from seven to ten feet in height, though they may magically change their skin and bones to much smaller shapes. Great ghuls are fond of perfumes and scents. They dwell in ruins or caves. They are excellent actors and liars, and many are powerful sorcerers.
Only jann slain by great ghuls become ghuls themselves; all other races are simply devoured.
There are two other breeds of ghul-kin, also undead jann. Soultakers[/b] have the power to take control of their victims' souls with a simple kiss. Witherers[/b] are the greatest of ghul-kin; they use soultakers as lieutenants and great ghuls as pawns in their elaborate schemes. They can age mortals with a touch.
