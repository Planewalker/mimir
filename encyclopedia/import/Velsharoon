Velsharoon is a Neutral Evil demiPower, also known as the Vaunted. His symbol is a crowned laughing lich skull on a solid black hexagon, his divine Realm is Death's Embrace in the Bleak Eternity of Gehenna, on the layer of Mungoth. This musty crypt of a realm is the realm of the Vaunted, and all secrets of necromancy are contained within it.
Velsharoon achieved demi-godhood at the end of 1368 DR, though he had been alive for some centuries before that. He found some texts created by Talos, showing the secret of becoming a demigod, but he switched allegiance to Azuth, knowing that Talos seeks ever to destroy his servants. Some say that Velsharoon is an alias of Mellifleur.
