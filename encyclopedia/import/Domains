Domains are the portfolios of gods in the form of divine magic. They allow the clerics that possess them to cast additional spells and enable additional abilities. Gods usually have four or five domains, and clerics can select two. 
Â For example, the Knowledge domain, granted by gods like Odin and Boccob, gives bonuses to Knowledge checks, and allows the cleric to cast various divination spells.
