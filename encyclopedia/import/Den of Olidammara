The Power of scoundrels, Olidammara the Laughing Rogue is an intermediate god who concerns himself with music, revels, wine, humor, and similar ideals. His Realm, the Den of Olidammara, sometimes called Winesong, is located in Ysgard's first Layer. Wood, stone, and stranger substances create a grand but haphazard structure, as if several mansions of various cultures were mashed together. On the inside, mazes, locked doors, blind hallways, and secret treasuries surround a grand hall where music and dancing are mandatory. Usually, the guests of this inmost den include rogues, bards, performers, and entertainers of all stripes and all places. Wine, romance, and song rule here, where Olidammara lounges at his ease on a grand divanâ€”unless he is disguised as one of his many guests using his magic laughing mask. Because some terrible prank often draws him far away from his den, other deities treat Olidammara with deserved caution no matter where they are.
