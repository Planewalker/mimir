Melchon is a baatezu+noble in the service of Mammon, on whose behalf he leads 18 companies of Erinyes in battle. A devil most jealous of his stronger fellows, Melchon is something of a malcontent in Minauros, and would welcome any setback to Bael or Focalor â€” but he masks his true feelings.
Melchon is a fiery red-skinned, humanoid devil with upturned, bull-like horns; black, curling brows and beard; black hooves; and large, crimson wings.
