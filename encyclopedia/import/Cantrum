What is today called the Dark Eight was originally called the Dark Nine (reflecting the Baator's nine layers). The ninth member to this illustrious gathering was Cantrum, who was acknowledged by the rest as their leader. At some point Cantrum sired Mordukhaver the Reaver, his son with Tiamat.
Cantrum was assassinated by either an Abishai or a paladin (accounts differ) and instead of trying to replace their irreplaceable leader, the other eight pit+fiends re-organized and called themselves the Dark Eight. 
Once every hundred years, one hundred osyluth gather in circle around the Dark Eight to discuss gelugons who deserve to get promoted to the rank of Pit Fiend. Together, the one hundred osyluth represent one vote, the Dark Eight possessing one vote each. This meeting is called Cantrum's Circle, in memory of Cantrum.
