Epona, goddess of fertility and horses, was worshipped throughout Gaul and Great Britain. Epona's interest in horses made her a favorite with later Gallo-Roman cavalry units, but the Celts never saw her as a deity of horses alone. 
Epona is usually portrayed with a mare or foal, and her symbol is a horn of plenty, a shepherd's crook, or a bunch of fruit. She has much in common with Brigantia in temperment.
Epona dwells in Tir na Og with her daughters, the Nic'Epona.
