Factotums are full-time members of a Faction. Unlike most namers, being in a faction is a full-time job for them. In Sigil, factotums act often as guides and messengers (the same thing as touts, but in the service of a faction), but  they may also be soldiers and scholars, diplomats or enforcers, or even spies or knights+of+the+post. Factions may give other names to their factotums as they see fit.
Factotums are outranked by factors.
