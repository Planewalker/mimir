Brightwater[/b] is a  Realm within the Layer of Olympus on the Plane of Arborea.
No less beautiful than Arvandor, Brightwater is well-settled with quaint cottages and manors. Unlike the elven realm, Brightwater is bustling with activity, all of it fun. The realm is devoted to joy, good fortune, pleasure, and beauty. It is the place to seize the day and live life to the fullest.
The goddesses Lliira, Sharess, Waukeen, Rudd, Tymora, and Sune all dwell here, at least on occasion.
