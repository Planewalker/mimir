Crius, one of the elder titans and a son of Gaea and Uranus, dwells on the Layer of Colothys on Carceri, banished there by the Olympian gods. His home is a temple of white marble in the mountains, built to the scale of individuals over 25 feet tall. 
Crius is the Titan of Weight and Density, able to increase or decrease the weight of objects at will.  He can make things immovable by mortals, or he can make them entirely weightless. He can cause anything launched at him to fall short of its target. Crius has used his unique powers to make immovable works of art. He's a brilliant sculptor and painter in a wide variety of media. He's also a wicked artist of torment, owning many frightening devices of torture and pain (but only usable on berks over 15 feet high).
