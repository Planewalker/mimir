God-isles are the immense petrified remains of the metaphysical ideals of powersÂ that have been slain or who died due to lack of worship. God-isles float on the Astral Plane, where Githyanki and others often mine them for minerals and build communities on their stony surfaces. One such community is the Githyanki capital city of Tu'narath. The Guardian of the Dead Gods watches over the god-isles and woe to those who would disturb them when he is near.
