The decatons are the lowest order of officials found in Modron society. They oversee the base modronsâ€™ physical welfare and serve as the voice of the greater powers to the working class.
A decaton appears as a tentacled sphere atop a pair of stumpy legs. Its ten tentacles are spaced evenly around its horizontal circumference. Above these are four eyes, also evenly spaced, and a single mouth, which is located at the very top of its body.
