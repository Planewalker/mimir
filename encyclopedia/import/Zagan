Zagan was a yuan-ti in an ancient empire, long before the rise of humanity. To his vast crowds of humanoid slaves, he was treated as a god, and his advisors finally informed him they had found a way he could become a god in truth: he had only to gather his thralls in one place and execute them in a ritual of power.
Zagan found, to his sorrow, that belief was power, and the death of his believers made him less godly, not more. As his might dwindled, his trusted advisors stabbed him in the back.
