Jovar is the sixth Layer of Mount Celestia. It is also known as the Glittering Heaven, probably because of the rather wasteful use of gems all over the place.
Its formed like a ziggurat, made up of seven layers. How a ziggurat can be a part of a mountain without actually, you know, being part of the mountain is anyones guess. The good guys want it that way, and that's what the good guys get. Ohh, and there's a Solar Aasimon on the top of the Ziggurat too. He guards something important.
