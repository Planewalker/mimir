The first layer of Pandemonium has the largest caverns, with some big enough to hold entire nations. Large or small, most caverns are desolate and abandoned to the winds.
Several of Pandesmos's caverns and tunnels possess a feature in common besides the omnipresent wind. Streams of frigid water flow from cavern to cavern, some down the center of the tunnel in midair because the objective gravity exerted by each wall cancels out the others. Many of these streams, but not all, are tributaries of the River Styx.
Pandesmos is home to the Madhouse, Winter's Hall, and the realms of Ho Masubi, Talos, Tuoni, Tuonetar, Raxivort, Telchur, Elo√©le, and Anshar. Other likely denizens are Norebo and Gelf Darkhearth.
