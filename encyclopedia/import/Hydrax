A hydrax is a kind of water elemental devoted to Law. Most tend at least somewhat toward evil - if they were Outer Planar creatures instead of Inner Planar creatures, they would dwell in Acheron.
Hydraxes are crablike creatures made from ice. Six legs and three arms are spaced evenly spaced around their carapaced bodies. Most of their time is spent constructing beautiful buildings and devices out of ice. Hydraxes are deadly foes with anemos, krysts, and undines.
