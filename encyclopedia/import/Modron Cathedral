The Modron Cathedral is hidden deep in the heart of Regulus. It's a tower so tall and vast that it seems to defy the laws of physics, but it doesn't - it's only cleverly and impressively made. Modrons are constantly buzzing about it, polishing it, revising it, and guarding it. 
The central feature of the cathedral is the Modron Orrery, a perfect model of the Multiverse made of spheres and clockwork. It can be used to observe the various conjunctions of the planes, and it can even be used as a scrying device allowing observers to see the clockwork actions of tiny people on an infinite variety of worlds, spheres, and planes - assuming the precise coordinants of those people are known. It can even be used to teleport people to any point in the cosmos - or are they merely within the Orrery? Is everything part of the Orrery already? 
Unfortunately, the sheer vastness and complexity of the device has been known to cause insanity. 
The Modron Cathedral cannot be visited without a pass from the modron Central Office of Processing and Requests.
