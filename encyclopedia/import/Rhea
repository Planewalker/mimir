Rhea is a Titan that was originally worshipped as the Great Goddess of Minoan Crete on the Prime Material Plane, and is an example of the Great Mother goddess who took many names and shapes. Above all, she symbolized fertility, in which her influence extended over plants, animals, and humans. She also controlled the varying seasons, caused products of the soil to flourish, and even protected men in battle.
Eventually, she became the wife of Cronus and gave birth to the Olympian powers. After Cronus swallowed Hestia, Hera, Demeter, Hades, and Poseidon, she saved Zeus by substituting a rock in swaddling clothes. Rhea’s anguish over the loss of her first five children was ended when Zeus grew to manhood and led a revolt against Cronus. In her true form, Rhea is a beautiful woman with a generous figure.
Since Zeus seized his father’s throne, Rhea has yielded much of her power and many of her responsibilities to her godly children. Nevertheless, she is still revered as the mother of the gods, and sometimes answers appeals concerning fertility or motherhood. Omens from Rhea generally take the form of dreams. 
She resides with her children in Olympus.
