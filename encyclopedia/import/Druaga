Druaga, the so-called Ruler of the Devil World, is a lesser deity who presides over the summoning of Baatezu. He is associated with the Babylonian Pantheon, though he is not related to those gods. 
Druaga has a realm in Dis called the Retreat of the Fallen. Both he and Dispater are aware of one another, but have a pact of mutual non-interference. The pact permits Druaga to force Baatezu to do his bidding, though the Lords of the Nine do not allow him to change the workings of the plane.
When a follower of the Babylonian pantheon enters Baator, he has to enter through Druaga's vile palace, with its smoke and shadows, columns and stirrings.
Druaga never appears to anyone the same way twice. His true form has eight taloned arms, ruby red scales, and four legs ending in snakey masses with the head of a beautiful boy.
