Cthulhu is a bloated humanoid form 100 feet high with an octopoid head and a face of tentacle-like cilia.  It has scaly, rubbery skin, and prodigious hands and feet with curved talons.  A pair of folded bat-like wings protrude from between its shoulders.
Cthulhu lies dreaming in the sunken city of R'lyeh, imprisoned by the Elder Sign.
