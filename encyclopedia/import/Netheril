The Human kingdom of Netheril on Toril began as the Alliance of Seventon, a cluster of villages at the edge of the Northern Sea, beneath the region now known as the eastern High Ice. At its height, the kingdom occupied the entirety of what the elves call the Anauroch Basin.
Netheril was a magocracy divided into two parts: Low Netheril, which lay on the ground, and High Netheril, made up of entire cities held aloft by powerful magic. The mages of Netheril wielded magic more powerful than any that can be cast today, as the goddess Mystra has put an upper limit on Toril's magic to prevent follies like that of Karsus, whose attempt to become a god killed Mystra's predecessor and destroyed High Netheril.
