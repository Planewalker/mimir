Mihstu are free-willed mist creatures of a malign nature from the Elemental Plane of Air. They like cool, damp places that are well hidden from sunlight. Mihtsu are not entirely solid and can shape their bodies at will, but they usually appear as clouds of swirling mists and vapors. They can seep through small cracks and openings, and can spread themselves out over larger areas.
Mihstu form four razor-tipped tentacles from their bodies when they enter combat.
