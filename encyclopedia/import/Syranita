The one aerial member of the Asathalfinare, Syranita is the goddess of the Aarakocra. She is great friends with Aerdrie Faenya, who introduced her to Deep Sashelas. She has other friends among the Djinn and Jann, human sky gods, Stronmaus, and Remnis. She is on good terms with Chan, who assists her when needed.
She appears as an aarakocra female with silver skin and pink-gold feathers. Her portfolio includes aarakocras, protection, sky, and watchfulness. An intermediate goddess, she is neutral good.
Her Realm, technically considered part of Arborea, is called Whistledge. Like Aerdrie Faenya's realm, which it borders, it exists on the border of Ysgard and Arborea; it consists of clouds, floating two-crowned trees, and flying islands. She can fly out of her realm into either of the two planes.
