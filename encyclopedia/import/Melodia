Melodia is a Burg in Buxenus, Arcadia's second Layer. It is noteworthy as the headquarters of the Harmonium. Like the rest of the plane, it is quite orderly and lawful, with a place for everything and everything in its place, well everything lawful and not evil. The Faction's Factol, Faith, can be found here along with an array of the Hardheads' High-ups.
