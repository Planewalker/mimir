Wraithworms[/b] are serpentine creatures found in deserts and wastelands throughout the Outer Planes. They may be found everywhere from Carceri to the Beastlands, and other places besides. They are neither good nor evil.
It's thought, however, that wraithworms are native to Pelion, the third layer of Arborea, where the first and most archetypal member of its race rests sleeplessly beneath the sands, guarding some ancient and terrible power.
Wraithworms have black scales and green, glowing eyes. A diamond pattern of purple scales marks their back, along with sharp dorsal spikes.
