Wee Jas, also called the Ruby Sorceress and the Taker, is a goddess of death, law, love, and magic worshipped mainly on Oerth. She has two realms in Acheron, in Tintibulus (called the Patterned Web) and in Ocanthus (called the Cabal Macabre). She is lawful neutral, but selfish and ruthless. She opposes gods of chaos, though one such god - Norebo - is her occasional lover. 
Wee Jas was an ally of Mystra of Toril, before the latter goddess died and was replaced by a deified mortal assuming the same name.
Members of the Fated and Dustmen are both appropriate as worshipers of the Ruby Sorceress.
