The nine tertian modrons are in charge of trial, judgment, and sentencing in Regulus. They supervise the quartons and hear all crimes brought against the realm's rigid orthodoxies. Most cases deal with Rogue Modrons.
Tertians look like twelve-foot-tall humanoids with horns on either side of their bald heads, and long prehensile tales that end in macelike balls. They cast spells as 20th level clerics and 20th level sorcerers.Â  They get divine spells from the Law, Protection, War, or (presumedly) Mechanus domains from Primus.
