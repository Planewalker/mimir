The undisputed "king of the wild mages," Horung was shunned when young. The Half-elf ventured alone into an area of wild magic and taught himself to harness the energies there: he has invented several spells. Horung is from Toril, but a wild surge sent him to another world.
He was recently initiated into the Xaositects by one of his former students, Quake Lavender.
