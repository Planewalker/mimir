Tir na Og, "the Land of the Ever-Young," is the Realm of the Celtic Pantheon in the Outlands. It's also studded with many small farms and villages. Many famous planars come from this region, including factols Erin+Montgomery and Darius the Veyl. 
It takes 3-18 days to get between each individual realm in Tir na Og. The Wild Hunt also roams the region, ready to hunt souls with its pack of red-eared fey hounds. Gods of this realm include Silvanus, the+Daghdha, Diancecht, the+Morrigan, Goibhniu, Nuada, Epona, Oghma and Lugh.
