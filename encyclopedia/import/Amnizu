Squat, hideous little Baatezu, amnizu (ahm-NEE-zoo) are guardians of the paths into the plane of Baator. Controlling legions of lesser baatezu, they ensure that none can pass into the plane through the River Styx without answering to them.
Although the amnizu caste is considered greater in status than that of the cornugons, amnizu are required to be "demoted" to serve as cornugons before they can ascend any higher in the baatezu hierarchy. This is because the amnizu are dominated by Prince Levistus, and often serve his wishes rather than those of the Dark Eight.
