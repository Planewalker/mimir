It is said that once Arborea hosted a third major pantheon, beside the Olympian gods and the Seldarine, who lived in what is now the wastes of Pelion. Originally, Pelion was fertile and green as Olympus, but as its ruling pantheon faded the layer crumbled to dust. 
Now only ruins remain, but secrets such as the Last Word can be found within.
