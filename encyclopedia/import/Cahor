Cahor the Deceiver is an exiled baatezu+noble dwelling on Avernus. He is a masterful actor, mimic, and illusionist, with real chaotic tendencies that make him detested by the lawful Baatezu hierarchy. He amuses himself trying to make Avernus into a realm of confusion, where no one but he knows where they stand. He manipulates an dmisinforms all he meets to stir up trouble, create feuds and strife, and upset diabolic plans. His destruction would not upset the other powers of Baator too terribly, but he is tolerated because his schemes confuse intruders as well. 
His true appearance, that of a tall, mottled black and gray-skinned, horned and bat-winged humanoid, is rarely seen.
