A male of the medusa species, Vashaak is the offspring of one of the most powerful servants of the Hag Countess of Malbolge, given as a gift to Triel+the+Fallen in hope of an alliance which never came to pass.
Vashaak is now the chief handservant of the Slug Archduke, performing many tasks including cleaning after the filth and offal left by the Lord of the Flies. He wears an iron mask and chains to keep his petrification ability from getting out of control.
