Vhaeraun, or Vhaerun, is the Drow deity of thievery, males, territory, and evil activity on the surface. His Realm, Ellaniath, is in Carceri, on the Layer of Colothys. It's said that no one can find it without his permission.
Vhaeraun is the brother of Eilistraee and the son of Lolth and Corellon Larethian. He was banished from Arborea along with his mother. His son is Selvetarm.
Vhaeraun is allied with Mask, Shar, and Talona. His enemies are many, as he is prone to carrying grudges, but he is at particular odds with Sehanine Moonbow, Eilistraee, and Lolth.
