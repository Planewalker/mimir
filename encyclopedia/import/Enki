Enki was a deity of the Sumerian Pantheon, known as a son of Enlil and a greater Power in his own right. Though a shapechanger, he always appeared as green as the rivers and oceans he ruled. He once had a Realm in Mechanus, a wheel covered with an ocean and bridged with a span of woven gold and finely-crafted crystal. Since his death, the sun-god Utu, whose realm once adjoined Enki's, has grown more wild and uncontrollable, and slid out of Mechanus into Arborea. Enki's wife was Nin-Hursag.
Enki was a binder of Tanar'ri and other demons, and the gods Anshar and Nergal of the Babylonian Pantheon used this to their advantage to lure him into a trap and kill him.
Some members of the Will of the One hope to resurrect him as a demonstration of their power.
