Frigga is the Norse Power of the clouds, sky, married love, and wives. In her role as goddess of married love, she is sometimes prayed to for fertility. Frigga is the second but principal wife of Odin, being the mother of Balder, Hoder, Hermod, and Tyr. She can foretell the future, and has the power to control all forms of weather, to view any area that has a breeze blowing through it, to assume the form of any flying animal, to spin flax into gold, and to make any husband fall madly and permanently in love with his wife. In her true form, she is a mature woman of great beauty.
Though permitted to share the throne with Odin, Frigga spends most of her time in her house, Fensalir in Asgard, spinning golden thread or weaving multicolored clouds. She often sends her avatar to attend to the welfare of mortal wives, either taking vengeance on cruel husbands or assuring deserving worshipers of a blissful marriage. Her wishes often conflict with those of her warrior husband, and she will not hesitate to resort to trickery to get her own way.
She has many proxies, but some of their names are: Fulla, Gna, Lofu, Gefjon, Eira, and Holda. Gna has a horse that traverses air and water.
