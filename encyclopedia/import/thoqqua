Thoqquas, also called rockworms or fireworms, are found equally on the Paraelemental Plane of Magma, the Elemental+Plane+of+Fire, and the Elemental Plane of Earth. On the Plane of Earth it's a hated vermin, but this is where it can find the most food. On Fire, it's relatively ignored, but it starves. On Magma, it achieves a balance but can't find contentment.
They look like worms made of magma. A thoqqua is about 1 foot in diameter and 4 to 5 feet long. It weighs about 200 pounds.
