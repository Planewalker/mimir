"The hordes" are life forms native to the Elemental Plane of Earth. Each single life force has hundreds of seprate insect-like bodies. The size of the bodies ranges from 3 to 21 feet long. One horde life force can control up toÂ  10,000 hit dice of bodies. Replacement bodies can be created at the rate of 1 HD per turn. Unlike insects, there is no "queen" body - the life force is widely spread, occupying all bodies evenly.
Each individual life force has its own name. All the bodies in a single life force will respond to the same name. The creature can only die if all its bodies are destroyed.
The horde creatures do not consider any other life forms to be intelligent. They take what they need without regard to other creatures. They are incredibly intelligent, and communicate telepathically with dozens of other hordes at once.
Each horde is very lawful evil and always dangerous. The hordes' enemies are the Kryst and the undines.
