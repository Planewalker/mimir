Fierana, or Fierna, is the Lord of the Fourth, the ruler of Phlegethos, the fourth layer of Baator. She is one of the Lords of the Nine. 
She manifests as a beautiful but fiendish woman with eyes that dance like flame. She projects an appearance of carelessness, of a concern with sensuality above the pragmatic concerns of government, but this is a Peel. 
Her father is Belial, the previous Lord of the Fourth. Some witnesses think that Belial has retired from Baatific politics; others think he secretly runs the whole show, and Fierana is just a puppet. Both are deceptions, as are most things in Baator.
