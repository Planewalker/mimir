Kochbiel (pronounced Kawkh - beel) was once one of the great generals of Baator, a marshal in the service of the now-destroyed Beherit. 
After Beherit's death, Kochbiel was exiled to Avernus, as he was too feared and mistrusted by the other Lords of the Nine to win himself another place in the hierarchy. A cold and calculating general, his inspired tactics, iron leadership, and personal brawn made him the victor in many armed squabbles against rival lords. Kochbiel is said to have explored (and enlarged upon) many subterranean chasms, caverns, and tunnel-warrens in Avernus, and is believed to spend much of his time moving about from one of these rough lairs to another. He and Nergal are rivals, and often find and raid each other’s treasure hoards.
Kochbiel resembles an exceptionally large, gray-skinned Pit Fiend with bull-like red horns. He has four massively muscled arms set in two opposing pairs — that is, a “front” pair plus a “back” pair facing the other way, two arms sharing a bony-plated, spike-horn-protected shoulder on each side of his body. His eyes are a brilliant, flashing yellow, and his tongue and inner mouth a vivid purple.
