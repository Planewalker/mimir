The Sunken City of Many Doors, Panchengjudohuh,&nbsp;is a ruined metropolis built in a magical cavern in Kara-Tur, beneath the city of Durkon in the land of T'u Lung. It is a mazework with doors that lead throughout Toril and other worlds of the Material+Plane, and to the upper and lower Outer Planes as well. 
What door leads where is unpredictable, controlled by the Ministry of Planar Adventures in the Celestial Bureaucracy. If the portals are abused, the Ministry may turn them off completely for a time.
