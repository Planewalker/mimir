Red Shroud is a Succubus sorceress/fatespinner (and member of the Fated) ruling the town of Broken Reach in the first layer of the Abyss, the Plain of Infinite Portals. 
Red Shroud isn't entirely inhospitable to travelers - it's in her interest to keep Broken Reach a popular stop - but she demands obedience from her guests, expecting them to help enforce the Reach's fragile peace. She has protected her Burg against mobs, Molydei, Githzerai, and even a minor Abyssal+lord. She keeps her current (and fourth) consort, a Nalfeshnee called Ygrax, as a pet. She's been known to sell her succubus daughters and Incubus sons to planewalkers with enough Jink. One such daughter of Red Shroud is Fall-From-Grace.
Red Shroud is a daughter of Malcanthet and Pazrael.
