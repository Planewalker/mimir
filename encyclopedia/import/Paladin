Dedicated to upholding law, promoting good, and serving as an example for others in the name of their god, paladins seem to live their lives as an effort to carry a tiny bit of their deity wherever they go. If they have done their jobs well, spending time on the plane in question will be like coming home, and bringing that same sense of beneficial transformation to other planes will be a worthwhile challenge for a truly worthy planar champion.
Paladins may thus provoke extreme examples from others. Those who share the paladin's faith treat the holy warrior with greater-than-normal respect. Those with opposite views consider paladins little more than sinister agents, and they treat them accordingly.
Some believe all paladins gain their powers from the First Monastery of the Planes-Militant.
