This huge wolf is the offspring of Loki and a giantess, Angur-boda. Due to an agreement among the gods not to slay each otherâ€™s offspring, the wolf cannot be killed. He is so strong that he can easily break any chain placed around his neck. He wandered Asgard free for many years before the dwarves finally forged a leash he could not break. Forged from the roots of a mountain, the noise of a moving cat, and the breath of a fish, this golden leash is no thicker than a strand of silk, yet it is completely unbreakable.
Thank Tyr for getting the thing on him.
Every now and then, however, the Fenris wolf slips his chain and travels to the Material+Plane in pursuit of prey. Men often know when this has happened, for it is a time of terrible omens when the avatars of the gods walk the land in search of the terrible beast.
According to the Norns, the Fenris wolf will devour Odin during Ragnarok.
In the Forgotten Realms, Fenris is known as Kezef the Chaos Hound, the Ravager of Heavens. He appears there as a huge mastiff whose flesh is covered with millions of bloated maggots.
