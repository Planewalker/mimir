The slopes of Solania, Mount Celestia's fourth Layer, are deeply tunneled with a vast dwarven mansion called Erackinor, the Realm of the dwarven powers Moradin theÂ Dwarffather and his wife, Berronar Truesilver. None but dwarves and dwarven Petitioners are allowed within. Those who enter and return speak in hushed tones of stonework and craftsmanship that far surpasses anything a dwarf might have seen on the Prime Material Plane. When Moradin fires up the deep Soul Forges below the roots of Mount Celestia, all the halls rush with the noise of the bellows. Dwarven clerics say Moradin uses the Soul Forges to temper the spirits of his people and their weapons. The forges may have other uses as well. The armories of Erackinor are second to none, and the combat-veteran dwarves and dwarven petitioners that fill Erackinor's halls make the mansion nigh impregnable.
