The Positive and Negative Energy Planes are inhospitable realms of raw life or death.
The Positive Energy Plane is life at its rawest and most dangerous. Brighter than the heart of a star, it can overwhelm a Berk, causing those who remain in the plane for too long to explode with sheer vitality, becoming one with the multiversal force of life. The Positive Energy Plane is thought to be the origin of mortal souls.
The Negative Energy Plane is raw death, a terrible, dark, enervating place that drain those who go there of their life force. The Negative Energy Plane is home to legions of spectral undead. The Dustmen maintain an outpost, the Fortress of the Soul, on this plane, and the Doomguard maintain fortresses along its edges.
