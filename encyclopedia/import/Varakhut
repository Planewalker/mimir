The mightiest form of Inevitable known is the oddly abstract and
utterly inhuman varakhut. These strange beings are the self appointed
defenders of all the gods, knowing that the destruction of any god
brings chaos on the multiverse and changes the balance of the concepts
that allow it to exist. The magical powers of varakhuts are immense,
and they are well equipped to defy anyone who should challenge their
magical abilities. Varakhuts are the undisputed masters of the inevitable
race, and though kolyaruts lead any groups of them, varakhuts can call
together a group of inevitables so that a critical mission is
fulfilled. With the power to change reality itself with ease, however,
these mighty beings of law rarely need any assistance.
