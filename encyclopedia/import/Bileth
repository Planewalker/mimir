Bilith is a baatezu+noble in the service of Baalzebul. He is Baalzebul's tribune, speaking with his master's authority.
Bileth appears as a large man clad in gilded coat of plate. He uses weapons only in a pinch, preferring to fight with his fists backed up by his massive strength. He is
bearded, crimson-skinned, and has horns and hooves. He is tailless, but has large black bat-like leathery wings. He can also breathe fire, but he will do this only if angered or hard-pressed.
