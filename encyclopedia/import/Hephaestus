Hephaestus is the Greek Power of blacksmithing and the patron of artisans, craftsmen, and mechanics. Unlike most gods, he is slightly deformed, resembling a tall, bearded hill giant with a club foot and a hunchback.
His mother, Hera, was embarrassed by her son’s deformities and kept him out of sight. In order to win the respect of the other gods, he fashioned a golden throne for her. When she sat in it, she was trapped, and he would not release her until she and the other gods accepted him as their equal. Since then, he has proven one of Olympus’ most valuable residents, fashioning golden palaces, intricate machines, and beautiful armor for his fellows.
Hephaestus is generally a benevolent god, though he is extremely touchy about his deformity. Although he is married to Aphrodite, he is in love with Athena, who will have nothing to do with him. Because he has so few worshipers, he treats them well, often making gifts of adamant weapons, shields, and armor to those that serve him especially well. Such objects have great magical potential. Omens from Hephaestus often appear in the flames of forges.
He resides in Olympus with the rest of the Greek Pantheon, in an area where volcanic activity is common. He works in the very heart of a volcano, aided by his uncles, the Cyclopes. Occasionally, the gnomish power Nebelun comes by to offer advice and help.
