Vidar a lesser god of the Norse pantheon, is a chaotic good lesser deity of silence and strength. He is one of the few Aesir destined to survive Ragnarok.
He stays in his hall in Asgard, Vidi, and keeps to himself as much as possible. He fights with the Aesir when asked, but would rather go off slaying giants on his own.
He is the son of Odin and Grid.
