A mimir is a magical device that records sounds that are given to it. A mimir operates in much the same way as a magical tape recorder, and is used by Planars to make diary entries or in record keeping.
A mimir will often take the form of a floating, talking skull made of unknown silvery metal and can be purchased in Sigil. But mimirs are not required to be in this form. Like any magical item they may be customized.
