Laghathti (lah-GATH-tee) are octopuslike obyriths that
have existed for eons in the+Abyss and are particularly at home in the
black depths of the River Styx. They also crawl along its bleak shores.
The oily black waters surge and froth as a storm of
tentacles erupts from below. Five of the midnight-blue tentacles have a
pale blue underside studded with hundreds of tiny mouths. Five others
are slimmer and end in wide paddlelike fins. Another two are shorter
and more muscular, terminating in long, crocodilian jaws that make a
horrific high-pitched wailing. The thing seems to have no body, only an
indistinct knot of writhing ropes and tendrils at its core.
