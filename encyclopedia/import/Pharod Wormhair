Pharod Wormhair is the Collector King of the Hive, a man crippled in body and spirit. His mind, however, seems to be as sharp as ever. He rules the Buried Village with an iron fist, keeping even that disorderly rabble in line. He is a sneak, a thief, and he seems to know far too much about you, though he does not reveal it without coaxing.
The "King of Rags" rules the Collectors, a community of crosstraders, graverobbers, and other desperate ne'er-do-wells beneath Ragpicker Square. He's also Annah's adoptive father (for whom she has, at best, ambivalent feelings). The Nameless One seeks him out because the tattoos on his back advise him to. Once a man of nobility and influence but dubious integrity, Pharod demands that the Nameless One retrieve a certain object, a Bronze Sphere, for him in exchange for information so as to avoid an infernal fate (unsuccessfully, as he is later found on the Pillar of Skulls in Avernus). He is later killed by shadows for his association with the Nameless One who, it is revealed, was the one who told him to look for the sphere in the first place (for his own purposes).
