Planar rabies is spread via the bite of an infected animal. At the end of the incubation period (2-20 days), the healed wound becomems irritated and painful, local extremities becoming stiff and numb. Psychological effects include depression and anxiety followed by periods of excitation and irritability, progressing to general terror and difficulty breathing and swallowing. The victim suffers from extreme thirst and spasm of the larynx that increases when water is present or even mentioned.
The next stage occurs 2-12 hours later, producing a thick, foamy secretion of mucus at the mouth and uncontrollable fits of rage. 2-5 days after that the victim dies from convulsive seizures, cardiac arrest, or respiratory disease.
Fiends, celestials, slaadi, modrons, Rilmani, elementals, genies, powers and so forth are immune to the disease, but fiends are frequently carriers of it. Sceulia is commonplace in the Beastlands/
