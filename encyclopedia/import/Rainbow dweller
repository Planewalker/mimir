The rainbow dwellers are among the purest forms of life on the Plane+of+Radiance. They have a translucent humanoid form composed completely of light and ever-shifting colors, with eerie opalescent eyes. 
Though intelligent, they are quite alien, and their actions are unpredictable (thus their chaotic neutral alignment).
