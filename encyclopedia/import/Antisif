Antisif the Befouler is an ancient Tanar'ri lord, the former ruler of the 21st Layer of the Abyss (now called the Sixth Pyre). He was the lord of blasphemy, a despiser of the gods and religious faith. He was once a lover of Malcanthet, and is said to be the father of those succubi who became the first of the lilitus. 
Antisif was betrayed and imprisoned by his balor general Kardum, who imprisoned him within the Wells of Darkness.
