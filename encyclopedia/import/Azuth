Azuth is the Faerun Power of wizards and mages (as opposed to Mystra, who is goddess of all magic). Azuth is Mystraâ€™s friend and advisor and has played an even greater role ever since the Time of Troubles. Care and caution in the use of magic are important to Azuthian spell casters. Magical mistakes often cannot be undone.
Azuth's Realm in Buxenus, the second Layer of Arcadia, is called simply Azuth, showing that if the god has a flaw, it isn't humility. The eclectic town of Mage's Rest, a bewildering cluster of eccentric wizardly dwellings, can be found there. Neighboring Azuth is the realm of Savras.
