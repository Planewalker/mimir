Fire elementals are masses of walking flame flickering around a central, vaguely humanoid form with two vaguely armlike appendages that seem to flicker back into the creature's flaming body only to spring back from its sides a few seconds later. The only facial features of a fire elemental are two large glowing patches of brilliant blue fire, which seems to function as its eyes.
Their language, Ignan, sounds like the crackle and hiss of a large fire.
They are ruled by Kossuth, their tyrant-king. On their own plane, they often dwell in mixed-race communities that include fire+minions, mephits, Harginn, Gen, plasms, flame+spirits, and similar creatures.
