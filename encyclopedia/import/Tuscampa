These monsters seem to be native to the prison plane of Carceri. Their huge tusks deliver a painful ripping to those unfortunate enough to be in the way, and their natural armor plating seems to protect them from bludgeoning attacks. They don't seem to be very intelligent, but what they lack in wits they make up for in brawn. More's the pity.
