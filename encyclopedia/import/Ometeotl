Ometeotl is "the god-above-all, of the near-and-close, he who is at the center" in the Aztec+pantheon. He is male and female, negative and positive, light and shadow. His female aspect is called Omeciuatl. He is the first of the gods, who created first himself, then the other gods, then everything else. He is never pictured, because he is as invisible as the wind. He never answers appeals for aid, and will only involve himself in human affairs if the order of the universe itself is threatened.
In the Astromundi+Cluster, he is known as Pyrax.
