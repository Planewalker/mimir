Brigantia is the Celtic Power of the rivers and rural life. She was raised on the milk of a creature of the other-world, a white, red-eared cow. She is worshipped by the Celtic queen Cartimandua (women in positions of power are not at all uncommon among the Celts) and by the pastoral villages and towns. She is the protector of flocks of geese and herds of cattle, seeing they flourish to help feed her hungry worshippers. Her dominion over the rivers allows her to use their waters for therapeutic purposes. She often wears a crown and is depicted in Celtic art sitting atop a globe. She is also sometimes outfitted for war, wearing a breast plate and carrying a spear.
Brigantia is of a relaxed, peaceful nature. She rejoices in the slower, quieter ways of the country folk, and never ventures into large towns or cities. Her tending of animals is compulsive, and she will often keep that task even when other pressing matters are brought to her attention. 
She shares a Realm, the Isles of the Blessed, with Belenus on Elysium's fourth Layer, Thalasia.
