Tantulhor is about the weight of iron, has
a slightly brownish color, can be worked into a smooth finish, and is
apparently
unbreakable - weapon blades fashioned of it will cut anything they
touch,
except stone. The metal can only be found on four of the planes of
Baator - Phlegethos, Malbolge, Maladomini, and Nessus - and
no
where else in the Multiverse. The very few mines in existence are
better
protected then most Baatezu fortresses, although acquiring raw
tantulhor
would do a would-be master thief little good. Methods of forging and
working
this metal is completely unknown outside the Hells, and the 3 currently
operating tantulhor forges are literally the best kept secrets on the
planes.
Even then, proper forging of a tantulhor blade may take years.
Knowledge
of the metal is limited outside the Hells to highly experienced sages
and
wizards who specialize in the lower outer planes. The Rod of Dispater
is
known to be made of tantulhor, as are many devils' talismans.
