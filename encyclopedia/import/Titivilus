Titivilus is the nuncio of Dispater. He is like a contract lawyer — he always looks for all possible interpretations or holes in promises made and things said. Like many politicians, he rarely gives a definite answer or position, but always appears to do so by using such words as “inoperative,” “determinism,” “authority,” “conclusive,” and “apparently,” and such phrases as “under consideration” and “at this time.” He will use jargon and archaic phrases; what Titivilus says usually doesn’t mean what one thinks it does.
Titivilus delights in punning, circular arguments, philosophical debates, and other
means of verbally bewildering others, and also enjoys being cryptic. He may well
polymorph himself into the form of a sage or mystic of some sort, protecting his deceit with misdirection, and spout meaningless or false prophecies (or even impersonate a deity, if an unsuccessful commune spell is cast nearby).
Titivilus appears very similar to a satyr, but he is actually more human-looking, save for his bat-like wings. His complexion is pale, but his face slightly ruddy.
