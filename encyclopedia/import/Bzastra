This rare, reclusive native of the Elemental Plane of Water had evolved by chance when several ring beasts basked in the aura of a blue waterwhip plant. The chemical natures of the ring beasts and the plant aura interact and fuse the two together into a new being. It is curious and observant, slowly exploring its native plane, sometimes recording its findings on shells.
The unemotional bzastra seem to have no goal other than survival and private contemplation. However, they live in a complex society of scholars, sharing their findings and ideas wordlessly. A bzastra domain is typically a vast kelp forest, telekinetically shaped to ward out dangerous predators or vermin. It contains a
number of well hidden individual dwellings, linked together by vine tethers.
