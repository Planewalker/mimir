The mad, tormented brother of Diirinka, Diinkarazan is bound to a stone throne in a level of the Abyss called the Prison of the Mad God (catalogued as Layer 586). The layer is a swirling vortex of air and gas, with rings of whirling rocks flying around him. The plane constantly distorts space.
Diinkarazan was so imprisoned by Ilsensine in retribution for his part in Diirinka's theft of magical knowledge from the illithid god. He appears as a tall, gaunt derro with a staring, insane face dominated by glowing red eyes with black pupils. His hair streams behind him, changing color, texture, and appearance. He cannot be freed by anything less than a greater god, and he is permanently insane and tormented by illusions of the things he most fears.
