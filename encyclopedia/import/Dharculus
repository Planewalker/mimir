A dharculus resembles a swarm of blind, writhing creatures flailing through the substance of the Ethereal Plane, where they are most often found, although they can attack in the Material+Plane. This swarm is actually a cluster of fanged tentacles that all f use together in a wormlike braid.
Dharculi originated in the Far Realm.
