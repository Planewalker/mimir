Ice was formally a Proxy of Lugh, but she fell from grace. Lugh let her live, but warned her that his remaining proxies would kill her if they saw her again. She fled to Sigil, where she makes a living giving advice to those who lack it.
Ice is a Tiefling, neither male or female though she identifies as a woman. She dresses in the black skin of a naga, with spikes and blades.
