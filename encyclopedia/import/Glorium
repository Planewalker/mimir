Glorium's a small Burg on the shores of a deep fjord, part of a sea that extends into the infinite Hinterlands. It's the Gate-town to Ysgard.
There are actually two ways to Ysgard in Glorium: one's a maelstrom in the savage waters of the fjord, leading to one of Ysgard's own seas. The other is a root of Yggdrasil, the World Ash, located in a cavern in the mountains outside town.
The people of Glorium are rowdy but hospitable, though they have an antagonistic relationship with the local bariaurs. The biggest threat to Glorium's safety are the beholder worshippers of the god Gzemnid, whose realm is nearby.
