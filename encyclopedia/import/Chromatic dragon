Chromatic dragons are generally regarded as the evil half of dragonkind. They are selfish, greedy and quite powerful, worshiping their evil 5-headed goddess Tiamat who resides in Baator. Their colors and powers are listed below.

White:[/b] The weakest and least intelligent of the chromatics. They reside in artic climes with devistating breath attacks of cold.


Black:[/b] These skull faced dragons reside in damp marshes and attack with streams of caustic acid.


Blue:[/b] These dragons live in the deserts of most prime worlds, burrowing deep into the rock. Their attacks are crackling bolts of lighting.


Green:[/b] These agressive dragons live in forests and use a harsh gas as their breath weapon.


Red:[/b] The strongest and most intelligent of the chromatics are also the most jealous of their horde. They use powerful attacks of scorching fire.

Not many dragons exist on the Outer Planes.
The Chromatic Dragon[/b] is also a nickname of Tiamat herself, just as her opposite Bahamut is often called the Platinum Dragon.
