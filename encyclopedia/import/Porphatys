The fifth layer of Carceri, Porphatys, is the spiritual home of the shallow and
self-absorbed who refused to aid others when they had the chance. It is a cold layer dominated by a shallow, acidic ocean, cut only by sand bars and drifts of semi-solid acid snow. Oceanus' Temple, dedicated to the Titan of the same name, is located on Porphatys.
