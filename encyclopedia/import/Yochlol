Yochlol are a subset of Tanar'ri that are specific to the service of the the goddess Lolth of the Drow pantheon. Yochlol are generally looked down upon, or even despised, by other tanar'ri because of their devotion to a single deity rather than the broad racial motivations of the tanar'ri race and the Abyss as a whole.
Yochlol appear as either attractive female drow or as large, one eyed, perpetually melting columns of waxy flesh with several grasping tentacles.
Yochlol are typically sent by Lolth to serve as intermediaries between herself and her priestesses, especially during important rituals and ceremonies.
