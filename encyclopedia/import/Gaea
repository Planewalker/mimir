Gaea, of the Olympian+pantheon,&nbsp;is a daughter of Chaos, sister of Eros, Erebus, Tartarus, Aether, and Nyx. Her firstborn and mate was Uranus. Her children include the Titans, the Hecatoncheires, and the elder Cyclopes. The latter two races were imprisoned in Carceri by Uranus. 
She schemed with her son Cronus to overthrow Uranus. He did so, but he was in turn overthrown and imprisoned in Carceri by his son Zeus, something Gaea still hasn't forgiven Zeus for. 
Gaea dwells on the Prime Material Plane. Some say she is the Prime Material Plane, the force that binds together all the worlds. Unlike most powers, she doesn't require worship, only life.
