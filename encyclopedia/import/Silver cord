Silver cords are tendrils that connects a Basher's physical body, usually on the Prime Material Plane or an Outer+Plane to its Astrally projected form. On the Astral Plane, it appears as a silver tail that extends off into the distance tapering off into nothing. The severing of the cord, say by a Githyanki knight's Silver sword, is fatal.
