Levistus is the Prince of Stygia, the fifth hell of Baator. Alone of the Lords of the Nine, Levistus ignores the ancient rules of courtly etiquette the others obey, openly declaring his desire to conquer the rest of the Hells. His Amnizu ignore the protocol of the Dark Eight, constantly conspiring against the rest of the Baatezu hierarchy.
Levistus is without doubt the most hated of the Nine; while the rest of the Nine hate one another, they hate Levistus more.
Levistus has been imprisoned in an icy glacier since he slew Bensozia, the late consort of the Dark+Lord+of+Nessus. He rules telepathically from within his prison. He has power over amnesia, having the ability to both steal memories and taunt amnesiacs with hints of their former existence.
