Skullrot is a prison for prominent "guests" on Carceri on the layer of Othrys. Adimarchus is one of the prisoners here.
Skullrot stands 200 feet tall and is made from the skulls of fiends somehow made as hard as stone. The wailing of its maddened fiendish prisoners can be heard from some distance away.
The jailer of Skullrot is the half-Gehreleth lich Dark Myrakul, a servant of Graz'zt.[/b]
