Galnaki, the "City of Spires," is a Githyanki city built atop an asteroid fragment. Very young for a githyanki city, it is only a few decades old, built by the githyanki mage/psion Trinth.
Trinth rules from a palace of glass and steel using a powerful artifact, a magical sceptre called Yrinolir. The sceptre sent her dreams of a world full of powerful creatures the githyanki once ruled - the world of Athas. Consumed with this vision, she gathered an army of followers in defiance of the lich-queen Vlaakith, and with the power of Yrinolir she conjured a bubble of force around her new city that cut it off from all - githyanki and other - who might interfere with her plan. Blasphemously declaring herself queen, she went to work.
