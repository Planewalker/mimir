Baatezu nobles stand somewhere between Pit+Fiends and the Lords of the Nine in the Baatezu hierarchy. They have been given their first taste of individuality by their patron lords as embodied by their unique forms and abilities. Serving as viceroys and advisors in the courts of the Lords of Baator, the nobles are an integral part of baatezu politics. They hold various titles such as baron(ess), count(ess), prince(ss), and duke/duchess, the meanings of which vary according to the Lord bestowing them. Although they serve the Lords, their primary goals are usually to improve their own station and eventually replace one of the Nine.
