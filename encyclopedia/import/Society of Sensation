The Society of Sensation (or the Sensates, as they are most commonly known) is one of the most diverse and powerful groups in Sigil. It is their belief that the multiverse is meant to be experienced, and that the only way to truly know that some exists is to sense it. 
Sip the wine, don't guzzle it, give everything a thorough looking-over, let the most fragrant of smells waft into your nostrils, exalt in the beauty and culture of the multiverse. Try everything at least once, because without new experiences you are nothing. If you do not sense the whole multiverse, how are you going to know anything? 
Members of the Society of Sensation usually take to the streets of Sigil searching out all there is to see and do and experiencing it. Some of them are fools that go out, drinking and reveling every night, giving no heed to common sense and reliving the same experiences over and over again. Almost without exception, these revelers end up vanishing from the streets of Sigil. Whether this is because they drink themselves to death or indicative of something else is unsure... their factol, Erin Darkflame Montgomery, has mentioned a 'culling' of sorts... Let's just say that the Sensates aren't for hedonists.
Prior to the Faction War, their headquaters in Sigil was the Civic Festhall in the Clerk's Ward. It was famed for its many Sensoria (plural for Sensorium).
After the Faction War, the Sensates disbanded their leadership, hierarchy, and place in Sigil's government, but they continue to practice their philosophy much as before. They are led by their new factol, Cuatha Da'nanin, from the Gilded Hall in Arborea.
Their symbol is of a face with large eyes, ear, nose and mouth with one hand outstretched. (Some whisper the face is of the Lady of Pain)
