Niflheim is one of the three glooms of The Gray Waste. The Layer is named for the Realm of Hel, the Norse death goddess, which is but one of many realms, burgs and other sites to be found on this layer. Other realms include those of Arawn, Pyremius, Ratri, Mask, and Shar. A root of Yggdrasil impinges as well. This is a cold, misty land.
