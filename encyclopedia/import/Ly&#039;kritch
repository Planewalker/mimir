Ly'kritch is a Shadow demon dwelling in Sigil, the City of Doors. It likes to haunt the Civic Festhall, drinking memories from the recorder+stones and trapping those who use the sensoriums into its own gems, which it purchases from Tarholt.
He is an ally of Qaida, who hides Ly'kritch in the catacombs beneath the Mortuary during the day. When Ly'kritch collects enough souls, it travels to the Gray Waste to trade them with other shadow demons, bringing choice souls to Alluvius Ruskin to interrogate.
