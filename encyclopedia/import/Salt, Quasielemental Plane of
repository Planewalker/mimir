The Quasielemental Plane of Salt is the death of water and moisture, desiccation incarnate in shining crystal - barrenness, infertility, cracking lips, eyes shriveled to raisins.
Its border with the Elemental Plane of Water is ordinary brine, but if a traveler foolishly goes deeper into the plane they risk becoming permanently encrusted, the salts leaching all moisture out of the poor Sod's body.
The Doomguard carved their Citadel Sealt on the border with the Negative+Energy+Plane.
Locals include facets, scattered tribes of salt mephits, minor kingdoms of salt quasielementals, and various forms of undead.
