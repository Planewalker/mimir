Anthraxus the Diseased takes the form of a 10' tall man with a rotting, diseased ram's head. He was originally an Ultroloth transformed by Night Hags to eliminate a swarm of meddlesome paladins from the Planes-Militant. When he had fulfilled his contract, he immediately wrested control of Khin-Oin from its previous owner (who some believe to be currently imprisoned in a mysterious abandoned city of dark stone lead in the caverns near the Vault of the Drow) to become the ruling Oinoloth. He ruled for centuries, but he was either violently ousted by Mydianchlarus or convinced to leave of his own accord by a seductive lie or secret that only Mydianchlarus knew. He now roams the Lower Planes, searching for work among the gods of evil. He is still practically a god himself.
His mortal cultists are marked with deforming diseases as a sign of their faith.
