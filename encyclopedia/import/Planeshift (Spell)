The planeshift spell is commonly used to get around from place to place in the Planes. It is a transmutation spell, level 5 for clerics, level 7 for wizards, and can transport multiple people at once. While a particular location on a plane may be targeted, planeshift is not accurate and travellers will arrive within a few miles of their location at best. Because of this, users of this spell should be prepared for adverse conditions on their arrival depending on the targeted plane.
