The chant is a Cant expression that means news, gossip, facts, zeitgeist, moods, or anything else that's going on. "What's the chant?" means "I require knowledge of recent vintage" in Rogue Modron parlance.
The chant is not the same thing as cant, and cant is not the same thing as the chant; the Clueless sometimes get these confused.
