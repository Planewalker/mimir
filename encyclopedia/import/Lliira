Lliira, Our Lady of Joy, is a lesser deity in the Faerunian Pantheon, presiding over carefree celebration, carefree feeling, contentment, dance, festivals, freedom, happiness, hospitality, liberty, and joy.
She also took care of Waukeen's portfolio of trade, money, release, and wealth while Waukeen was held prisoner by Graz'zt. Since her friend's return, Waukeen once again claims these spheres of influence for herself.
She dwells in Brightwater in a district called the Quarter of Orange Lanterns. The quarter is quietest during the day, with crowds milling, eating, and enjoying the sun, engaging in picnics, summer dances, and courtship. At night it blossoms into a loud carnival packed with musicians, drunks, scantily-clad dancers, beggars, and knights+of+the+cross-trade.
