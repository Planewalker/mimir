Taba is a Altraloth, the ultimate master spy and thief with the ability to take the shape of any Fiend. It is not known for certain that she is female, but that is the form she is most often seen in. She is able to slip in and out of any of the Lower Planes without notice. She speaks all lower planar tongues with no accent and can radiate any evil alignment she chooses.
She can help anybody get anywhere, from Zelatar to Malsheem - for a price. Those who wish to contact her must do so through her dozen or so Night Hag creators.
