Tintibulus is similar to other layers of Acheron, but the giant stone forms are found in other shapes than cubes - including tetrahedrons, octahedrons, dodecahedrons, and icosahedrons. The blocks are solid throughout and made of gray volcanic stone. When collisions occur, the stone fractures along regular hexagonal fault lines.
Tintibulus is sparsely populated. Wizards come here to study the magic and mathematics of the plane. The Patterned Web is the Realm of Wee Jas, along with the Cabal Macabre in Ocanthus.
