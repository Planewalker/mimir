Puchan is the Vedic Power who guides, watching over travelers, ushering the dead to Yama’s Realm, leading men to wealth or away from trouble, and showing herdsmen where to find good pastures for their cattle. He also brings all things into proper relationship with one another, blessing marriages, protecting men from those would exploit them, and determining what shall be food and who shall be the one to eat it. As the protector of travelers, he often comes into conflict with Kali, whose priests prey on travelers in order to perform their bloody rites. In his true form, Puchan appears to be a normal man, often carrying a golden lance.
Puchan is a beneficent god who tries to help mortals by setting them into the proper relationships with their environment. He is especially disturbed by Kali and her worshipers, whom he considers twisted manifestations of the cosmic order. In areas plagued by Kali’s sects, Puchan’s avatar is often found begging for passage with a group of travelers that seems likely to be attacked by the thagnas.
His realm, Restweal, can be found in Brux, the second of the Beastlands. His priest Duprak Jarneesh is one of Sigil's Golden+Lords.
