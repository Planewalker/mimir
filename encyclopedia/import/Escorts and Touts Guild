With the fall of Sigil's factions and the rise of the guilds that followed the Faction War, the Escorts and Touts Guild formed from the combination of the pre-existing Escorts Guild and the group of independent touts headed by Kylie the Tout. The guild ensures that those who need a guide don't get bobbed. The guildhall sits on the end of Turtle Lane, just spikeward of the Great Gymnasium, in the Guildhall Ward. It is a two-story Kip of simple white stone and a vaguely blue slate roof skirted across with Razorvine. Members are identified by a mark of three concentric blue circles tattooed on forehead or painted daily.
