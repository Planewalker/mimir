Kuan Yin is one of the most popular of the Chinese powers, for she is the goddess of mercy. She constantly strives to ease suffering of all kinds, and is especially fond of rescuing shipwrecked sailors, curing the diseased, and protecting endangered women and children. Her surname, Sung-Tzu-Niang-Niang (“Lady who brings children"), reflects her place as the goddess of human fertility. In this role, she makes sterile women fertile and brings souls to newborn children. In either aspect, Kuan Yin’s true from is that of a slim young woman dressed in white.
Kuan Yin is dedicated to compassion and peace, especially where women and children are concerned. When somebody commits a violent act that affects children, there is a tiny chance per child and/or woman affected that she will notice and send her avatar to intervene. The person responsible will always be punished severely, though not by the loss of life. Omens from Kuan Yin are often delivered by talking infants. Any woman stealing a pair of slippers from Kuan Yin’s temple will become pregnant. 
Kuan Yin's Realm, The Lotus Garden, is found on Mount Celestia's fourth Layer of Solania on a mountaintop adjacent to Chung Kuel's Ministry of Virtue. Followers of Kuan Yin seek her out to ask for peaceful mitigation of troubles and blessing in childbirth. She is served by Archons and spirit folk.
