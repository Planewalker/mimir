Equinals are the second most common Guardinal (after cervidals). They look like large humans with some equine qualities - huge chest, steel-hard, hooflike fingers, long manes, and so forth. Make no mistake, though - they're celestials, personifications of good.
Equinals enjoy one another's company and are fond of athletic games of skill. In times of war, they're the heavy foot troops of Elysium.
These guardinals are famed for their tenacity, bravery, and stubbornness.
