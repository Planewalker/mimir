The Fortress of the Sun, once known as Light's Blessing, is the Realm of the Power Pelor of Oerth, also known as the Sun Father and the Shining One. This greater deity is the master of sun, light, strength, and healing. Pelor's domain, once a vast manor surrounded by orchards, vineyards, and farmland for miles, is now a goldplated citadel that forms a beacon atop Krigala, the largest island Elysium's Layer of Thalasia. 
The Fortress of the Sun dominates the land for a hundred "miles" around and is clearly visible from the shores of the River Oceanus. It glows like a beacon day and night, providing continual daylight for a hundred miles in every direction. Creatures are affected as if in full daylighr within Pelor's realm, regardless of where they hide. 
Pelor sits in a great audience chamber at the highest spire, where he confers with guardinals, planetars, and solars, dispatching them to deal with the forces of evil throughout the Multiverse. Because Pelor is one of the most powerful deities on the Great Wheel, he has correspondingly more control over Elysium's morphic nature. Everywhere his golden light reaches magic of sun and light are enhanced and illusionary magic is diminished. Pelor has the power to make additional changes to magic if he wishes.
