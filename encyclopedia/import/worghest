Worghests are Planetouched descended from the union of a goblin and a Barghest. They look like blue-haired, wolflike goblins, but can take the form of wolves and feed on the flesh and life force of their victims. Their eyes glow orange when they feel passionate about something. They're cowardly creatures who avoid positions of leadership despite their great strength and size. They tend to be lawful evil.
