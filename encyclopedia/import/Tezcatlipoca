Tezcatlipoca is a god of night and treachery in the Aztec+pantheon. He was formally worshiped by the Toltecs as a sun/warrior god who fought a daily battle against the night, but he has changed after he was dethroned by Quetzalcoatl. He has never forgiven Quetzalcoatl for his fall. As god of moon and lightning, he is known as Apocatequil.
He dwells in the constellation of Ursa Major. His former aspect is very similar to the Maztican god Tezca. His holy symbol is a jaguar, or a black mirror.
