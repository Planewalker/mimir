Agares was a Dao general murdered by his lieutenants for being obsessed with defeating a particular opponent.  Such behavior was considered a sign of disloyalty, although Agares remained dedicated to his emperor and the cause.  Because of the betrayal, Agares became a Vestige instead of dissipating and merging with the Plane+of+Elemental+Earth.
