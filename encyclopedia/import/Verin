Verin (Vuron, Ztefano) is the Master of the Roving Hordes and the Chancellor to Graz'zt. Verin is one of the most brilliant minds in the Abyss, infinitely patient; able to comprehend the motives of the lawful, chaotic, good, and evil alike and predict their future actions. He hasn't a bit of elitism in his skeletal, transparent body, and he treats tanar'ri and mortals with equal respect. He has a network of spies throughout the plane, and is often found in the courts of other lords of the Abyss to advise and manipulate him. As the albino Verin, he is well known as a servant of Graz'zt. In his aspect as the ebon Ztefano, few know his origins or loyalties.
