The Reckoning was a war in Baator where the lords Zariel, Belial, Moloch, and Baalzebul fought the alliance of Dispater, Mammon, Mephistopheles, and Geryon. Both alliances ultimately turned on Asmodeus himself before Geryon and the Dark Eight revealed the whole thing had been a trap. 
In the aftermath, Geryon and Moloch were dismissed from their positions, and Mammon and Baalzebul were forced to take new forms. Belial was made to retreat into the shadows, making his daughter Fierana the official ruler of Phlegethos. The Hag Countess was given charge of Malbolge, and Levistus was returned custody of Stygia.
This happened thousands of years ago.*
