Ice weirds resemble beautiful women carved from transparent ice; the lower halves of their bodies are columns of ice disappearing into Paraelemental pools. Due to their rigid natures and fear of melting, they have become predictors of the unending battle between Chaos and Law.
They are one of two races of elemental+weirds related to the Quasielemental+Plane+of+Ice. The other is the dazzling Snow weird.
