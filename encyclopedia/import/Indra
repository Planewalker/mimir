Indra, also known in earlier Vedic times as Parjanya, is the Power of the atmosphere, storms, and battle. He is the embodiment of aggressive action, a great lover of war, and was the leader of the Vedic+gods when the Aryans first entered India. Indra always watches any battle with great interest, and often cannot resist sending his avatar down to participate on the side which has shown him the most favor. He has the power to raise those slain in battle, as well as complete control over anything occurring in the air, such as storms, rain, wind, and especially thunder and lightning. Indraâ€™s true form is that of a muscular man with unusually long arms and red skin.
Indra is arrogant, selfish, jealous, and completely amoral. He is also prone to gluttony (especially where drink is concerned) and loves all other pleasures of the flesh. When a worshiper who regularly honors him with riotous feasts is about to enter a desperate battle, there is a small chance that Indra will send his avatar to help. Omens from Indra come in the form of storms, lightning, or wind. 
He resides with Vayu and Agni in the Realm of Swarga in Limbo. It is a giant spherical vault filled to the halfway point by a sea of enchanted milk. Indra's abode is in the center of this vault, floating on what is either an island-sized tortoise or a tortoise-shaped island. His palace, described as a marble blob covered with carvings of the god and blanketed by constant rain, is served by a hundred hundredfold of the chaotic faithful.
