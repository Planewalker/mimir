The plane exists at a strange angle to the rest of the Multiverse, its geometry skewed, with dimensions most Cutters have never heard of.
It is also called the Dimension of Nightmares by the people of Mystara. In the nation of Glantri there, wizards have created a school of magic empowered by the energies of this strange Demiplane.
Inhabitants include diaboli, malfera, Neh-thalggu, nagpas, and fihyrs.
The Demiplane of Nightmares is coterminous with the Region of Dreams and the Far Realm. Some say a portion of the plane has been taken by the Dark Powers of the Demiplane+of+Dread, and is now part of that other demiplane.
