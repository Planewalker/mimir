Scramblespeak is the odd language spoken by members of the Xaositect Faction. It can range from the mixing around of the words in a sentence to completely incomprehensible sentences. An example might look like this: "Was the faction Karan once led sometimes by" meaning "The faction was once led by Karan, sometimes."
