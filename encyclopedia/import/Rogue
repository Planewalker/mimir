Rogues are either heroes or heels. Creatures on the Lower Planes grudgingly give them a hateful respect - in their opinion, a good rogue is untrustworthy, treacherous, and deceitful (good qualities all from their point of view, unless practiced against them). Beings of the Upper Planes hold the same opinions of a rogue's character, but find little laudable in those qualities. 
The only thing more varied and unpredictable than a rogue's intentions are the infinite planes of reality. No matter what a rogue wants to do, no matter what treasure or information or experience she seeks, it can be found somewhere on the planes.
