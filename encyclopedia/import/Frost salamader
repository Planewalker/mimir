Frost salamanders are evil reptilian creatures native to the Paraelemental+Plane+of+Ice. The biologists of Mystara believe them to be native to the Salamander of the Elemental+Plane+of+Fire, though there is little evidence for this. They have six legs like a basilisk. There are rumors of peaceful, intelligent societies of this creature, but thus far they're only that.
