The Armory is located in the The Lady's Ward or the Lower Ward, depending upon whom you ask, and, prior to the Faction War, housed the members of the Doomguard. It was a great place to buy and sell weaponry in Sigil.
Many other factions would have loved to have taken over the Armory, the Harmonium for example, but the Doomguard had the weapons, and they liked to keep it that way. When the Faction War erupted, the Armory was destroyed when it was assaulted by the Hardheads. For a year afterwards, the Armory stayed a collapsing ruin.
With the Sinkers gone, the Armory is now in the hands of Nicolai Mabru, a formerly chaotic Basher who found order and harmony and now attempts to pass on these ideals to those who would train with him in the rebuilt structure.
