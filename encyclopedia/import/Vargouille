Horrid creatures from the Lower Planes, vargouilles [/b]are disembodied heads grown wings. Their bite is lethal, and worse, the victims of said bite are likely to become vargouilles upon their death. Though the vargouilles are not too dangerous in single combat, they flock to a fight and can prove deadly to an unprepared traveler. Those who would travel in dark places and catacombs should be wary.</p>
