Bar that[/b] is a Cant phrase meaning "shut up," or "don't talk about that." It's not considered terribly rude; it's quick, to the point, and often used as a warning. 
"Those Githyanki weren't so tough. I don't know what the big deal about them is."
"Bar that, Phineas. The githzerai looks like he takes exception to your Screed."
The phrase is also a way of dismissing something that seems nonsensical. 
"I heard the city of Union is wealthier than Sigil!"
"The Mercane Anthill? Bar that!"
