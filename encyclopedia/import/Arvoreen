Arvoreen , the Defender, is the nearest thing the Halfling Pantheon has to a Power of war. He is the god of defenders, promotes the strategy of "active defense," that is, preparing for the eventual incursion of those who would harm the halfling race and being ready to repulse the invaders. His Realm can be found in the Green Fields on Mount Celestia.
