A dimensional sextant is an 8-inch sphere (constructed out of any appropriate material) with arrows protruding out from it in all directions. It leads the bearer to the nearest planar Portal. The dimensional sextant is held in both hands, and the shimmering arrows point in the correct direction.
This device is more or less the same as the "planar compass" described in The Planewalker's Handbook, except with the planar compass you can seek out the nearest portal to a specific plane, providing you have an object from that plane.
It's also very similar to an Elemental compass.
See also the Sextant of the planes.
