Torm's realm in Mercuria is known as Trueheart; his palace, located in the realm's heart, resembles a military fortress. Its walls are mithral, its battlements diamond, its gates adamantine. Hosts of Archons and Aasimon fly in and out at Torm's command, serving the cause of Law and Good on the planes. They are particularly vigilant against the plans of Bane.
