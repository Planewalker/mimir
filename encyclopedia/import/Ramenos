Ramenos is a sleeping god revered by bullywugs and other degenerate amphibious humanoids. He is in declinine, having dwindled to the status of a lesser god over the centuries and being likely to decline still further. The evidence of his old power is now in ruins. 
Ramenos dwells in Smaragd, catalogued as the 74th layer of the Abyss, where his Tanar'ri worshippers push sacrifices into his open mouth. Merrshaulk and Sseth dwell on the some Layer.
