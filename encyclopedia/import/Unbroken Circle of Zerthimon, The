The Unbroken Circle of Zerthimon is a text engraved on a complex puzzle made of steel. It is both a record of Githzerai legend and a learning tool, for each legend is a parable containing a secret of githzerai sorcery. 
The full text can be found here.
The zerths who revere the text of the Unbroken Circle were considered heretics by other zerths, and this division among the People was enough to weaken the walls of Shr'akt'lor, allowing an enemy army to break inside.
There are some who allege that the Unbroken Circle is a fake created by one not of the githzerai people in order to enslave them. Others insist the text is pure, even if its author was not.
