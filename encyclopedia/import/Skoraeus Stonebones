The god of stone giants, called the King of the Rock and the Living Rock, Skoreaus is part of the second generation of Giant gods, born at about the same time as Surtr and Thrym. It is said that his brothers' evil drove him to hide himself below the world and ignore everything apart from himself and his people. He is knowledgeable about banes, magics, and great treasures buried in the Underdark. His chosen sphere is artistic achievement.
He dwells on the Material+Plane. He knows all that occurs in areas that touch stone.
