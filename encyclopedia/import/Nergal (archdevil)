A powerful baatezu+noble, Nergal hoped to rule the Layer of Malbolge after the destruction of Beherit, its previous ruler. Instead, the layer was given to Baalzebul, who controlled it through his viceroy Moloch. 
Nergal was banished to Avernus, the most powerful of the "rabble of devilkin" banished there. He appears as a lion-headed, winged toad with mottled pinkish-grey, warty skin covered with sores which ooze a clear, colorless, poisonous ichor. The ichor gives him the name Bringer of Pestilence and Fever.
