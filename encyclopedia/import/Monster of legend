Monsters of legend are archetypal forms found throughout the Upper Planes, beings of legend incarnate. Whenever epic stories are told about battles with monsters, a single monster of legend appears in the Outer Planes, worthy of all the tall tales told of it. Examples include The Hydra, The Chimera and The Kraken. These are not to be confused with the various hydras, chimeras and krakens found throughout the Prime Material Plane.
