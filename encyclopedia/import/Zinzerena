Zinzerena is the Drow goddess of deception, ambush, humiliation, rebels, and assassination. She opposes the rule of Lolth or others who would tyrannize the dark elves. 
Zinzerena was born a drow sorceress with an aptitude for illusion magic. Her mother faked her death in order to smuggle her away from the priestesses of Lolth. She grew in power, studying alone as a spellcaster and assassin specializing in the use of poison and disguise, and gained her divinity by tricking Keptolo out of a fraction of his. Lolth banished her from Toril and is using her name and image as a disguise, attracting rebels and dissidents to her own worship through this ruse. On other worlds (particularly Oerth), Zinzerena still prowls the subterranean depths of the Material+Plane as a lone assassin and opportunist.
This goddess is popular among members of the Revolutionary League.
