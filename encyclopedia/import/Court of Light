The Queen of the Nagas, Shekinester, calls the Court of Light her Realm. It can be found spireward of the Gate-town of Plague-Mort in the Outlands. Divided into three parts, the Court is sought out by those planewalkers that wish to purify their souls and test their character. The realm is split into three different sections symbolizing the three natures of the Naga Queen. Outermost is the Loom of the Weaver, a maze of tangled, thorny vegetation, then the Hall of Tests, the Shkinester's palace, and within the palace is the Arching Flame, a spirit-cleansing fire.
