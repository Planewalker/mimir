This gaunt biped has black, leathery skin, glowing eyes and bat wings. A berbalang is an odd creature that spends most of its time in a comatose state while its spirit wanders the Astral Plane to philosophize, court and mate. Its outlook on life and the multiverse is unusually uplifting and positive, but a berbalang doesnâ€™t feel it has any rightful place in it. Berbalangs resign themselves to be loathsome, murderous monsters undeserving of love or kindness. Their incorporeal spirits travel to the Prime Material Plane to feed on sapient life.
