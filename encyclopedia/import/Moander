Moander is a dead god once worshiped on Toril. His portfolio included corruption, parasites, and decay.
It was Moander who tainted the Olympian goddess Tyche in the guise of a sweet flower, threatening to turn her entirely to evil before Sel√ªne split her into two seperate beings, Beshaba and Tymora.
He was slain by Finder Wyvernspur using a shard of paraelemental+ice.
His Realm, Offalmound, was on the 223rd layer of the+Abyss, also known as Rarandreth.
