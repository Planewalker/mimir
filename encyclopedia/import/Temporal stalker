The temporal stalker is an undead creature found in the Demiplane+of+Time, the spirit of a dead chronomancer. They appear to be composed entirely of the mist-smoke of the demiplane compressed to a near-solid form, pulsing with silver light, with twin red glows signifying eyes. They can create minor paradoxes with a touch, and those slain by temporal stalkers become temporal stalkers as well.
