Myhriss is a lesser deity worshiped on Oerth. The goddess of beauty, love, and romance, she is depicted in a number of ways, all beautiful and female. Wee Jas dislikes her, but she appreciates the vain goddess for her obvious attractiveness. She is neutral good.
She rises from the River Amiel in Thalasia, the fourth Layer of Elysium.
