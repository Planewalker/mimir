Yondalla is a greater goddess of the Halfling Pantheon. She is lawful good.
Yondalla presides over bounty, children, community, creation, death, diplomacy, explorers, family and familial love, fertility, halfling life, halflings, harmony, leadership, prosperity, protection, security, the cycle of life, the hearth, tradition, and wisdom.
Her realm, the Green Fields, is in Venya, the third heaven of Mount Celestia. Most of the halfling gods dwell there with her in a paradise of endless harvests and mild weather.
Yondalla also has a darker aspect, Dallah Thaun, Lady of Mystery. Dallah Thaun is the secret of the halfling people, who do not mention her around outsiders. She is the patron of secrets, guile, lies, half-truths, flattery, stealth, and manipulation. Yondalla does not quibble with her other self over her methods, as they share a common goal.
