Yan-C-Bin is an Archomental, the Elemental Prince of Evil Air. More subtle than the other princes, only a slight disturbance in the air marks his passing. He spends his time wandering the Plane, spreading fear to all who dwell on the Elemental Plane of Air.
Yan-C-Bin is served by the race of ildrisses, who act as his spies throughout the plane.
