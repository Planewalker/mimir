Martinet is the constable of Asmodeus. His job is to clean up the frequent political messes of Baator. His influence has stopped several wars from breaking out among the lords, and his diplomacy has ended even more conflicts. Martinet has an extremely level head, and he never flies off the handle. He has withstood the tirades of Baalzebul and Mephistopheles without raising an eyebrow, and he always has a cunning retort. While he is not greatly powerful himself, he is feared because others know he is the voice and mouth of the Dark Lord of Nessus.
