The 1e MotP says this:
"Yurtrus's realm on the layer of Oinos is dreary and depressing even by
Hades's standards. All plants die before reaching its borders. Only
Yurtrus and his equally silent orc spirits live within; even the
daemons tread carefully through this terrain."
On Hallowed Ground says this:
"Almost nothing is known of Yurtrus or his realm, which is commonly
called Fleshslough. That's because anyone who enters the realm never
leaves, not even avatars sent by other powers. The entrance to the
place is two great black-iron doors set into a forbidding hillside in
Oinos; the stench of death wafts out every time the doors swing open."
