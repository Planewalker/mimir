Chilimba is master of the lava+mephits, seemingly a hybrid of magma+paraelemental and lava mephit stock. He studied torture under a pit fiend, and by the end of his training it was he who was teaching his master in innovative new torments.
Chilimba dwells in a fortress of basalt on the Paraelemental Plane of Magma called the Caldera, carved in the image of an immense red dreagon.
