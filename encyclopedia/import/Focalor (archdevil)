Focalor is seneschal (an agent, or bailiff) to Mammon, and wields much of the real power in Minauros, for his master is somewhat neglectful of security and diplomacy. The thin, often silent Focalor is careful in word and deed, and a master strategist. He is respectful, too, and takes no risks with the safety of Glwa (Mammon’s consort) and that of the palace itself. Most of the other archdevils (and the outcast Nergal) believe that Mammon would be easy prey were it not for the strength of his few dukes, and for the wise care of Focalor. Focalor’s loyalty seems unshakeable; most of the archdevils have in the past tested it, and they continue to do so.
Focalor appears human — a thin, bearded, and middle-aged statesman or sage with power and heavy concerns — until he unfurls his feathered wings from his flowing robes or reveals his brown cloven hooves. Focalor wears an iron gauntlet on his right hand, as his badge of office. He is normally armed with a staff, but will seize any weapons in battle. His skin is a pale pink-green, and if his armpits and flanks are revealed, tiny scales will be seen.
Focalor is also the name of a Vestige.
