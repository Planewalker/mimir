The Cadence of the Planes is the rhythm the Multiverse beats to. The Transcendent Order believes the multiverse is a living thing with a heartbeat, a rhythm. It knows exactly what should happen, and Ciphers can decipher the Cadence and know it too if they only open themselves up to it, no longer burying the Cadence beneath a barrage of thoughts. By cultivating silence they can learn to listen, and remember what they truly are.
Think with the multiverse, not at it. Be the planes. Be one with the Cadence.
