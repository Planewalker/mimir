Moignos are bizarre, two-dimensional creatures that roam Mechanus. Their tuny bodies are nothing more than strings of equations given form and shape by the Plane itself. They have no visible sensory organs and all but the oldest can be seen through. As they age they become more complex equations. These work to make all the necessary calculations to keep all the gears of Mechanus in harmony.
