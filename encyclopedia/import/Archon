Archons (ARE-kon) are beings of pure law and good,natives of Mount Celestia. They minister to and protect the inhabitants of their plane, and champion lawful good throughout the multiverse.
Archons begin on the first layer of their plane as glowing, incorporeal lanterns; those who learn well the lessons of the caste are promoted to higher forms. Archons are ruled by the seven Tome Archons, each of whom rules a layer of the plane in the name of the gods who share it with them.
Because the archons and gods of Mount Celestia are tied into the same bureaucracy, archons may be "promoted" into Aasimon of various kinds. Most archons above hound status serve the gods as well as the plane in general. Those archons who "fall" into Chaos, but not Evil, are transformed into asuras.
Archons sometimes become involved with the Blood War; when they do, they battle the chaotic Tanar'ri in preference to the lawful Baatezu. They dislike the baatezu's evil ways, but know they cannot hope to defeat both races of fiends at the same time.
