Eolians [/b]are a form of chaotic Air elemental, shifting wind-beings that look like heat shimmers though they are actually cool and solid. Chaotic to the extreme, they help planewalkers if the mood strikes them, although they later may get the urge to betray or even harm their “friends”. Eolians count anemos and krysts as their natural enemies, as well as the highly regimented hordes. They launch unpredictable attacks against the cities of the Djinn.
