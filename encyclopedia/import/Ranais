Ranais, usually called the Funereal World or simply Funereal, ]was a world on the Prime Material Plane where gods if death were worshipped; each city worshipped a different one. When the city of Moil turned from the worship of Orcus to other gods, however, Orcus tore the city&nbsp;from the face of the world, casting it into a Demiplane near the Negative+Energy+Plane and put its people in a sleep from which they could not sleep until they witnessed the sun - and, of course, the demiplane was permanently dark. Eventually the sleepers died, though their ghosts continued to haunt its streets.
The world itself died shortly after Orcus' violation of it, the sun becoming small and cold and the inhabitants becoming wraithlike creatures who call themselves the Lovelost.
