Harrowfell is a tower ruled by demons on the layer of Othrys in Carceri. It is made from broken weapons of the Blood War somehow welded together with fell magicks. At its peak is a spire of magical crystal that protects the minds of those who touch it against unwarrented intrusion.
The current ruler of Harrowfell is an exiled Marilith called Byakala.
