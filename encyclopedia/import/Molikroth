Molikroth was the devious and cruel Baron of Cania, who siezed control over the layer in a coup from its previous lord, the Archduke Mephistopheles. He had power over ice and cold, and was known - like his predecessor - as the Lord of No Mercy. 
For thousands of years, Molikroth ruled Cania from the citadel Mephistar with absolute authority, keeping a watchful eye on Prince Levistus. No one passed into the layer without the Baron's knowledge. 
Molikroth manifested as a grossly huge man, wearing foppish, flamboyant finery. He looked like a foolish clown in his expensive Sigilian fashions, the better to convince people to underestimate him.
And underestimate him they did. When his underlings had given him enough rope to hang themselves, Molikroth revealed himself as another guise of Mephistopheles himself. Revealing a new portfolio aspect - hellfire - Mephistopheles incinerated those who had betrayed him by joining Molikroth's coup. 
His consort remains Baalphegor.
