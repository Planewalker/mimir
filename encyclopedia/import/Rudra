Rudra is the Vedic Power of storms and disease, the bringer of death, and the malevolent deity who feeds on the corpses of those slain in battle. Because he has the power to cause disease, however, he also has the power to cure it â€” though he utilizes this ability far too rarely. Rudra is also a lord of the animals, with the ability to spread disease or vitality among them as well. He carries a large black bow which fires invisible arrows of disease. He has the power to create a storm at will. In his true form, Rudra is a red-skinned man with a blue neck.
Rudra delights in spreading disease. When he is not terrorizing some part of India with a terrible storm, he is busily firing his invisible arrows of disease at hapless mortals. If properly worshipped, by sacrificing a cow upon waste land, Rudra may be persuaded not to fire his arrows at a particular community. Omens from Rudra often take the form of illness or an unexpected storm. 
His Realm, Focus of Energy, is located in Mechanus on a cog that interlocks with those of Varuna and Yama. His cog, though no less thick than the others, opens into a huge chasm. Within this chasm Rudra is said to fire his arrows into the Prime+Material, culling the weak and leaving the worthy. He is served in this plane by the maruts.
