Obyriths are primordial beings of Chaos who inhabited the+Abyss long before the Tanar'ri, who some claim they created. 
Yugoloth legends claim the obyriths themselves were created originally by the baernaloths, their own creators. Others claim the obyriths are a sort of spiritual pollution generated when the powers of Law shaped primal Chaos into the Great Ring as it appears today.
Their forms are monstrous, alien, maddening to look at. Reality refuses to acknowledge their true shapes. 
Obyrith races include the Ekolid, Laghathti, Sibriex, Uzollru, and Verakia.
Notable obyrith lords include Areex, Asima, Bechard, Cabiri, Dagon, Kizarvidexus, Obox-ob, Pale Night, Pazuzu,  Veshvoriak, Vroth-Khun, Ubothar, Ugudenk, and the Queen of Chaos.
