Reorx is a small god. He's a dwarf you see. Not tall like Sargonnas or goodest as Paladine. He really likes dwarves. They're his favorite over all others in the whole world. He lives in caves and mountains. That can be a bit boring.

Reorx dwells in the first Layer of Arcadia in a Realm called the Anvil of Creation.</p>
