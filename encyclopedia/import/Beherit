Before Moloch, the ruler of Malbolge was Beherit (called Lucifer in Elminster in Hell).
Beherit was destroyed by Asmodeus for breeding archdiabolic children
without permission - he was devoured whole by the Overlord of the
Hells, and his consort Batna was destroyed as well. Beherit and Batna's
son, called Lucifuge in Elminster of Hell and conceived in
defiance of Asmodeus' decree, was also destroyed. Baalzebul, who had
been Beherit's chief rival, fought Nergal over posession of the layer.
Asmodeus granted the layer to Baalzebul, exiling Nergal to Avernus.
Baalzebul appointed Moloch to rule Malbolge in his absence.
