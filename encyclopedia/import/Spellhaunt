A spellhaunt[/b] is a living spell. They're formed when spells are cast in places where planar energies warp the nature of reality. Sometimes a spell cast on one Plane can create a spellhaunt in a completely different part of the Multiverse. Spellhaunts are not intelligent, but they can sense magic and attack that they might feed on it.Â  
Without a steady diet of magic, spellhaunts dissipate and die. Chant has it that an Abyssal+Lord (no one can agree on which one) has domesticated a group of spellhaunts, which the Tanar'ri call Feeders.
