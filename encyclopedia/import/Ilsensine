Ilsensine is the god of the illithids, manifesting as a glowing brain with tentacles. Ilsensine is a god of mental dominion, psionics and (some say) magic. It dwells in a series of caverns beneath the Dwarven Mountain in the Outlands called the Caverns of Thought, along with a vast army of mind-controlled thralls. 
Ilsensine is served by illithids, Cranium Rats, and Eaters of Knowledge.
