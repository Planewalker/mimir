Vathris is a hero-deity of anguish, lost causes, and revenge worshiped by some few on Oerth. Two thousand years ago, he was a demigod of progress and ingenuity worshiped in the city-state of Itar. He died, along with his nation, in a war with the rival state of Sulm. He returned to life, sort of, about thirty years ago, when thirty-six of his ranking priests enacted a ritual to revive him.
He is much diminished from his previous form, with a grisly torso wound that still oozes black bile, wielding the onyx longspear that killed him. His eyes are empty sockets. Where he once stood for the future, now he only obsesses about the past. He can manifest only once or twice a year, and then he dies again, to reemerge a year later. Needless to say, he has no permanent Realm.
