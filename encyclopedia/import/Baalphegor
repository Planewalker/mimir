Baalphegor, the consort of Mephistopheles, is a most highly regarded she-devil, attractive,
charming, and artful, the inventor of many of the strategies and
devices used in the hells. Asmodeus regards her as one of his most
valuable assets and he tolerates the machinations of Mephistopheles
because of her. She is a musical-voiced, beautiful female, apparently
human save for her ruby-red eyes, forked tail, and slim, delicate
leathery wings. Her feet are human in appearance, and she is sleek and
curvaceous with cinnamon-brown skin. She appears young and carefree,
but when angered her light voice can crack like a whip, and her eyes
flash fire. She is only five and a half feet in height.
