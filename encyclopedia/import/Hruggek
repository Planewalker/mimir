Hruggek delights in savage combat, but does not seek mass
battles or epic warfare - he teaches his people to use their stealth
and wiles to pick off small groups. He and the other gods of his
pantheon have an understanding - they don't act contrary to his
interests, and in return he leaves them alone. He has a slight alliance
with the the goblin god Khurgorbaeyag, and urges him to work against
Maglubiyet. He doesn't get along with Bargrivyek, who seeks to unite
the goblins and hobgoblins, something Hruggek sees as dangerous.

Hruggek's cave in Hruggekolohk, his Realm in the second Layer of Pandemonium, Cocytus, is surrounded by severed heads of various
races, which continually cry his praises or beg for mercy, and gift him
with powers against their respective peoples. Hruggek didn't make the
heads - they were already there when he arrived, remnants of more
ancient gods who carved the plane's tunnels. Perhaps Kali, the Indian
goddess, was involved. He manifests as a muscular bugbear.
Hruggekolohk is unusually honeycombed and filled with many standing pools, interspersed with bones and garbage. These pools are magically heated, and various forms of pallid, grublike life grow within them. The Petitioners congregate in villages on the banks of these pools, often hunting the sickly pond creatures. Stealth and ambush are the favored bugbear methods of war.
