Khaasta are a planar lizardlike race walking on two legs known to be aggressive and vicious.
The nomadic khaasta roam the Outlands, the Abyss, Pandemonium, Limbo, Ysgard and Yggdrasil in caravans, raiding, slaving, trading, and foraging. It's said they originated in Demogorgon's realm, but they've since spread much further. They keep giant lizards as beasts of burden.
