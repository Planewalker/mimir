Torch is the Gate-town in the Outlands to Gehenna. The city's built on three volcanoes rising out of a blood-red marsh filled with poisonous frogs, leeches, and death. The upper sections - one on each volcanic mountain, Karal, Maygel, and Dohin - are walled, connected to one another by bridges. The lower sections fester in the swamp, with no walls to protect them.
Torch has no less than six major thieves' guilds. Prominent locations in Torch include the Festhall of Falling Coins and Daubei's Obscure Woe.
The Portal to Gehenna is a gigantic scarlet orb that hovers in the air like an unblinking eye, or a very close moon. It can be reached by flying, teleporting, or by dropping from a tall spire and trusting your luck.
