Yeoman[/b] is a Burg in Bytopia, in the Layer of Dothion. The people there, mostly gnomish Petitioners, are dedicated to hard work and its rewards. Great veins of metals and minerals, as well as fine woods, provide the locals with ample materials for their skillful crafts. And don't try to Peel 'em, Yeomanites are Peery to cross-traders and react harshly to scragged thieves. 
The Planar Trade Consortium is making inroads in Yeoman.
