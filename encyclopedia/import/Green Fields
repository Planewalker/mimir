On Mount Celestia's third Layer of Venya lies the combined realms of the Green Fields. These realms include Yondalla the Nurturing Monarch's, Arvoreen the Defender's and Cyrrollalee the Hearthkeeper's. Here crops never fail, the weather is always mild, and plentiful harvests are a blessing. As the realms of the halfling powers, that means comfort. The Fields is a combination of burrowed households, small rustic buildings, and endless fields. No large predators live in the Green Fields; moles, rabbits, and badgers are common.
