The Dirk &amp; Firkin is a well-heated, well-kept greenhouse in the Lower WardÂ  that has attracted large crowds of upper+planar customers ever since it opened. It's a fragrant refuge full of Eladrins, palm trees, Aasimon, flowering plants, Einheriar, ferns, bariars, lillends, and devas.
Those weary of the ward's stench make pilgrimages here. It's also a tavern - the food is simple but wholesome, and the drinks are strong, clear, and sweet.
