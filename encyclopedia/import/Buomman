Buommans, the "moaning monks," are inhabitants of the Astral Plane, possibly descended from humans hundreds of thousands of years in the past. They dwell in temples and shrines on the corpses of dead gods. 
In appearance buommans are similar to humans, but with long, sagging faces and elongated hands and feet. They are slightly shorter and slightly heavier than humans; males have long hair and bushy brows, while females have no apparent body hair. 
They have a racial vow against speaking, communicating by means of low, throaty song. They tend to be lawful neutral or lawful good.
