Rotting Jack was a Proxy of Kiaransalee (formally a servant of Orcus) in Thanatos. He was a Babau with rotten skin and eyes, both crawling with maggots. He ruled Naratyr in Kiaransalee's absence, plotting to destroy and replace her. 
When Orcus returned to rule his Realm once more, Rotting Jack was among those destroyed or sent as conscripts to the Blood War.
