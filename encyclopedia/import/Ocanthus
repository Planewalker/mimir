Ocanthus, the final Layer of Acheron, is said by some to be the source or final destination of the River Styx. It is an eternal storm where razor-sharp blades of ice (frozen Styx water) cut and slice every fleshy thing that dares to exist here.
The Bladelings survive within the gray wood of their city of Zoronor; little else does. 
Wee Jas has built a delicate yet horrifying castle that glows softly in the darkness of the layer. She calls it the Cabal Macabre; she has recently moved into it after abandoning her previous Realm, the Patterned Web in Tintibulus.
