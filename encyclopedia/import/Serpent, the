The power of eldritch might stirs in the heart of the multiverse with an intelligence and a soul all its own. The most powerful arcanists know this and grow familiar with magic’s own mind and spirit. Some call it the Serpent, and others call it the Godmind or the Soulspark. Whatever they term it, they know it exists—even if they never speak that knowledge aloud.</p>
- Monte Cook, The Book of Eldritch Might II</p>
The Serpent is an enigmatic being or force worshipped by the lich god Vecna. It is magic itself. 
Some sages suggest  that is a overgod of evil and magic, a similar to Ao, the overgod of the faerunian pantheon. Overgod are creatures who do not interfere in mortal matters but have the power to promote or demote gods.
