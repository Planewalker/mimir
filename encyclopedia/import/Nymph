So beautiful that a glimpse can blind or even kill a man, nymphs are embodiments of loveliness, a triumph of nature. They are ever-young women with sleek figures and long, thick hair, radiant skin and perfect teeth, full lips and gentle eyes. Her scent is delightful, and her long robe glows, hemmed with golden threads and embroidered with rainbow hues of unearthly magnificance. They inhabit the loveliest of wilderness places, clear lakes and streams, glacier palaces, ocean grottos, and crystalline caverns. They believe in the sanctity of nature and will try to keep their lairs safe and pure.
Nymphs are common in Arborea. Their deity is Verenestra.
