St. Bane kicks ass and takes names. He does what the good gods are afraid to do. St Bane wears armor and a flowing white beard, and he carries a flaming trident, "the Scourger." He is a hero-deity and renowned paladin of Pelor, the patron saint of all who hunt the undead. He was granted divine ascession after slaying Khuul the Witch-Ghoul, a servant of Orcus who terrorized the northern Flanaess centuries ago. He is an ally and former member of a group of planar heroes called the Whiteguard.
