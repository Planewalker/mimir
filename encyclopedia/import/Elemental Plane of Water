The Plane of Water is just that: water as far as the eye can see. There's no surface and no bottom. Occasionally, coral reefs stretch up from the depths, supported by slender branches that extend endlessly into the immeasurable depths. In these immense caverns are the palaces of noble marids. The greatest of these is the Citadel of Ten Thousand Pearls, naturally shaped from a gleaming coral reef. It's a place of brilliant fish, flawless pearls, swaying coral fans, and exotic flavors borne here by distant currents. Not far from this is a vortex to the plane of Air, known as the Bubble Net. Another major metropolis is the City of Glass.
Elsewhere the plane changes, gradually becoming cold and icy in one direction (Ice), cold and misty in another (Steam), thick and slimy in a third (Ooze), and bitter in the last (Salt). Little else is found here, because the denizens of this plane have scant interest in the doings or offerings of outsiders.
Natives include Marids, Nereids, water+mephits, Undines, Water elementals, Water weirds, Tritons, Hydrax, spitters, Varrdig, Suisseen, and Bzastra. There are also merfolk, sahuagin, krakens, sharks, plesiosaurs, leviathans, and singular beasts so unimaginably huge that they don't have names.
