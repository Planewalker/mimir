A former apprentice of Horung the Anarch and a teacher of Quake Lavender, Nahal is curious about the effects of wild magic on the world of Toril. She has studied extensively and uses her knowledge to help others avoid being harmed by wild magic. She also searches Toril (and other planes) for Horung. She does not realize yet that Horung the Anarch has been initiated into the Xaositects by Quake Lavender.
Nahal is human, and neutral good.
