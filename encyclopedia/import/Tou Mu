Tou Mu is the goddess of the North Star in the Chinese Pantheon. She appears as twenty-foot tall woman with sixteen massive arms, three eyes in her barely human head, and red scaly skin. She carries a bow, arrows, a spear, a sword, a flag, a living dragon's head, a lotus flower, and a piece of the moon, all of which she is able to use as weapons; her free claws do a great deal of damage as well. She flies in a chariot made of adamantine with gold figures of dragons decorating the sides. The chariot tongues are made of solid diamond and the wheels are unbreakable green jade.
Tou Mu dwells with Lu Yueh in a layer of the Abyss called Feng-Tu, in a mighty citadel constructed on a forked branch of the River Styx called How Nai-ho. The citadel of Feng-Tu is entered through Kuei-Men-Kuan, the Gate of the Demons. The two deities rule over a household of Manes and other demons.
