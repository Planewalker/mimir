Mask is god of intruigue, shadows, and thieves in the world of Toril. He is neutral evil.
His Realm, the Shadow Keep, is located in Niflheim, like Shar's realm, although some place it in the Plane+of+Shadow (like Shar's realm). It is a small castle built of raw shadow. The castle is almost impossible to see in the gloom of the plane, though a daylight spell can make it stand out long enough to be visible. Mask spends little time here, as he prefers to move about the planes participating in heists and divine intrigue.
