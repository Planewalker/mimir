Vucarik, the Consort of Chains, is a powerful demon lord thought to be a son of Pale Night. 
Unlike most lords of the Abyss, Vucarik rules over no single layer, but instead roams the entire plane at his whim. The sounds of metallic rattling always precede the coming of the lord and his host. Wielding lengths of enchanted chain and covered from head to toe in rust-darkened metal, the battalion scours the Abyss (not to mention adjacent planes), seeking to inflict the tintinnabulous word of Vucarik on those who will listen. At his whim, he may elect not to kill those who he encounters, but send them forth as heralds or warnings instead.
