Fire genasi, or Flame Lords as the call themselves, are Genasi, that have an ancestor from the Plane of Fire or were heavily influenced by the plane. The most common ancestor for these genasi are the Efreeti genies. Typical physical traits for these genasi include perpetually warm skin, hair that moves like fire, or a scent of something being burnt (Just what often depends on their mood).
