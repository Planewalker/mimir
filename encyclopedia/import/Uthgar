Uthgar is a god of physical strength worshiped by Uthgardt barbarian tribes on the world of Toril. He is chaotic neutral.
His Realm, Uthgardtheim, is found on the first Layer of Ysgard. Though cold, it is no worse than the cold regions of Faerun - a far cry from the realms of deities like Loviatar and Auril.
