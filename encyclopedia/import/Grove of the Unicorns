Deep within the Beastlands layer of Krigala is the Grove of the Unicorns, a realm Ehlonna shares with the like-minded goddess Mielikki.
The grove sits at the base of a cluster of great sequoias that form a
natural cathedral for those beneath the canopy. The lowest branches of
the great redwoods are hundreds of feet in the air, such that those
with wings can fly through Ehlonna's cathedral without difficulty. Those
who reside within the borders of Ehlonna's realm live in peace with the
trees and animals, and they are similarly left alone by the wild
creatures. The thinking creatures of the Beastlands adore Ehlonna, such
that she is often aware of occurrences that happen far from her domain.
True to its name, the grove attracts groups of unicorns. In addition,
there are herds of bariaurs in Ehlonna's service. The grove is not far from Skerrit's realm; centaur petitioners are found in Ehlonna's realm and unicorns in Skerrit's. Shialla's realm, the High Glade, is also adjacent.
Mielikki's grove is unremarkable for itself, but notable for the celestial chargers and unicorns that frequent it.
