The World Serpent is an archetypal entity, the universal symbol of the snake holding its tail in its mouth, representing infinity and so forth. It is said to have shattered long ago, breaking up into numerous aspects, including Shekinester, Jazirian, Merrshaulk, and Ramenos. The Slavic Pantheon knows of the aspect Zmiya, the enemy of Perun. The Norse Pantheon speaks fearfully of Jormungandr, son of Loki.
