This suit of Mercykiller armor apparently has been standing here in the prison under Curst for some years. It has not been disturbed, which is strange, considering how very quick the people of Curst are to seek a profit.
A fanatical Mercykiller who is lawful neutral, Vhailor's drive for Justice is so strong that it enabled his soul to remain long after he had died and his corpse rotted completely away. He now inhabits his suit of armor, and does not appear to recognize that he has died. He simply doesn't think about it - and why should he, when there are so many criminals in the Multiverse to bring to justice? Vhailor's favored weapon is his executioner's axe, "Final Judgement." The "Final Judgement" is a cursed weapon and cannot be removed from Vhailor, even if a Remove Curse spell is cast on him.
When he was alive, he tried to track down and bring to justice one of the Nameless One's incarnations. This incarnation sealed Vhailor in a magical prison in the gate town of Curst. When the current incarnation of the Nameless One (the player) meets Vhailor, Vhailor doesn't immediately recognize that the player is the killer he has been hunting. However, through a certain conversation path, the Nameless One can end up revealing to Vhailor that he is the killer that Vhailor has been tracking, ending with violent results. Other conversations allow the Nameless One to convince Vhailor to depart this realm and truly "die".
He is found relatively late in the game in a magically sealed prison cell located under Curst. Like Dak'kon, he can immediately join the party after conversing with him for the first time. Near the very end of the game, The Nameless One will battle Vhailor in the Fortress of Regrets if the player has been mostly chaotic and/or evil throughout the game.
