Many settlements in the dwarven realms engage in profitable trade in metal goods. Like their prime brethren, planar dwarves are well known for their skill at the forge. Those that leave the realms often use the skills they have learned to set up their own smithies in whatever plane they settle in, and cities such as Sigil are always receptive to dwarves for just this reason. 
The majority of dwarves are found in the Dwarven Mountain, located in the Outlands. Most non-lawful, non-evil, dwarves are drawn there either when they die or when they find it on their travels. Lawful neutral and lawful good dwarves are most often encountered in Erackinor, located in Solania, a layer of Mount Celestia. Some dwarves can even be found in Nidavellir (the realm), which is located in Nidavellir, the third layer of Ysgard. The dwarves of Nidavellir tend to be slightly chaotic, and many of them are also magically inclined.
The duergar make their home in Hammergrim, a realm in the second layer of Acheron, Thuldanin. Finally the derro, a race of chaotic evil dwarves, are found in the Hidden Betrayal, located on Phlegethon, a layer of Pandemonium.
Millennia ago, the frost giants of the Iron Waste, Kostchtchie's Realm in the Abyss, enslaved a tribe of duergar and brought them to their home to craft armor and weapons. All but the hardiest perished, and those who survived gradually changed, becoming more like their frost giant masters.
