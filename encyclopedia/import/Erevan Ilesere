Erevan Ilsesere is the elven god of mischief, change, and rogues. He is a fickle, unpredictable deity who can change appearance at will. He has a great fondness for fine wine. Besides elves, he is also worshiped by some pixies, leprechauns, brownies, sprites and other small, elflike beings.
Erevan is friends with Garl Glittergold, the Daghdha, Olidammara, and other deities of fun and fortune, but his boon companion is the draconic Power Avachel, also called Hlal. He dwells in Arvandor in a shifting, trap-filled palace made from wood, stone, and crystal near one of Yggdrasil's roots.
