Zenythri are Planetouched with the blood of lawful neutral planar beings. 
Zenythris most resemble perfectly formed humans. They range in height from 5’7 to 6’3 with perfectly smooth skin, evenly shaped bodies, and well-defined muscles. Even their hair naturally forms into the zenythri’s personal style. They are often attractive by human standards, and could easily pass as one if not for the bluish-purple tint to their skin. Some have more unusual features such as metallic colored hair and eyes, or even areas of skin that have hardened into metal.
