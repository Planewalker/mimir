Faluzure is a draconic deity representing energy draining, undeath, decay, shadows, illusion, and exhaustion. He is worshipped by shadow dragons and undead dragons. He is also called the Night Dragon; his burrow, the Mausoleum of Pain, is in the desert Layer of Minethys in Carceri.
Faluzure is a wretched, creeping thing no longer able to fly, but he has a gravely terrible beauty nonetheless. He is vast and sleek, with silver-edged scales of midnight blue and vestigial wings; he may also appear as a handsome human or comely elf. He is a brilliant, gifted master of disguise, and lacks his sister Tiamat's recklessness. He requires a continuous stream of death to maintain his beauty and perfection; if he goes without death for too long, he becomes gaunt and skeletal.
Like Chronepsis, Bahamut, Tiamat, and others, Faluzure is a child of the draconic creator deity Io. Faluzure hates Bahamut and Tiamat equally, and he fears Chronepsis. He may occasionally ally with Nerull.
