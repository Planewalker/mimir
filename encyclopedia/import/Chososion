Chososions[/b] are alien creatures similar to manta rays with constantly fluttering fins and stranger appendages - long, flexible pseudopods ending in flat grasping pods that extend from their mouths.Â  The pseudopods are the only parts of the chososion that are ever corporeal - the rest of the creature only barely exists in this Multiverse. It's thought they dwell primarily in some unknown plane, sometimes called the Macrocosm, which acts as a bridge between the Inner Planes and another multiverse entirely. See also the Ordial Plane.
Chososions are never seen outside the Inner Planes.
