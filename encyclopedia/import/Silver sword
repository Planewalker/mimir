Silver swords are swords created by the Githyanki for use by the knight caste. They are magical in nature and the level of magic imbued in them varies from sword to sword. The greatest ability of these swords is to cut the Silver cord of an astrally projected entity, killing their bodies wherever they may be projected from. Should one of these weapons fall into the hands of a non-githyanki, there is no means the githyanki will not employ to retrieve it.
