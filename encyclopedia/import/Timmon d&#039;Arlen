Timmon d'Arlen is a Golden Lord, a powerful merchant prince of Sigil. The d'Arlen family has long been trying to gain control of Sigil's touts, but hasn't completely managed it yet. They've long been fighting a silent war with the Transcendent Order over this point, and Timmon was even manipulating the Fated as a weapon toward this goal until Rowan+Darkwood put a stop to that (whether Timmon retains any influence over the Fated now that Darkwood is gone is an interesting question; the current Factol of the Fated, Aram Oakwright, is a relative of Emma Oakwright, who had been d'Arlen's tool).
