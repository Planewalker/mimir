This disease is common on planar layers where war and death are commonplace. Limbs afflicted with abysal rot eventually become gangrenous, leaving a Sod with few options outside of powerful magical curing or amputation. The most common occurence of abyssal rot comes from injuries received by Tanar'ri, Baatezu, or rotting undead.
