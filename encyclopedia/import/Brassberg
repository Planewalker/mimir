Brassberg is the realm of Aasterinian, one of the deities of the Draconic pantheon.  It is located in Nidavellir, on Ysgard. It is a series of small caverns just big enough to contain Aasterinian's hoard. Trespassers are devoured unless they're amusing; some members of the Society of Sensation have survived a visit to her realm. Aasterinian does enjoy the inventions of the Norse dwarves, and sometimes her avatar walks among them in dwarven guise.
