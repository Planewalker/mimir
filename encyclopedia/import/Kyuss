Kyuss, the Wormgod, is a hero-deity known in the world of Oerth, imprisoned in an obelisk there by a flawed ritual. He was once a priest of Nerull.
He is responsible for a number of grotesque, sometimes undead, creatures collectively known as wormspawn. These include the spawn (or Sons) of Kyuss, avolakia, ulgurstasta, hounds of Kyuss, and the worm that walks.
