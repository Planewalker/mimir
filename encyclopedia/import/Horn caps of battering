These small brass caps fit over the ends of a Bariaur's horns (they can also fit on the tips of other creatures' horns, but the horns must actually be part of that creature's body). They allow the bariaur to make a ram attack equal to that of a battering ram.
Female bariaurs don't typically have horns, incidently.
