Hanali Celanil (HAN-uh-lee SELL-uh-nihl) is the elven goddess of love, romance, beauty, fine art and artists. She is one of the three aspects of the greater goddess Angharradh. 
Hanali dwells in Arvandor with most of the rest of the Seldarine, owning a crystal palace there. She is romantically linked to Erevan Ilesere; Fenmarel Mestarine resents her for spurning him long ago. 
She shares the waters of Evergold, which grant youth and beauty to those who drink from them, with Sune, Aphrodite, Bast, and other goddesses of beauty.
