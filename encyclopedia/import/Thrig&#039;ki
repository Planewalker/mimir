Thrig'ki is a lesser deity of the Neogi Pantheon.
Although the deity of “love,” Thrig is better translated as jealousy or
hatred. To neogi, jealousy and love are the same. Thrig’ki appears as a
neogi with writhing snakes for hair and twelve spidery legs.
Thrig'ki is neutral evil. Its home plane is the+Abyss, which the neogi call Karish.
