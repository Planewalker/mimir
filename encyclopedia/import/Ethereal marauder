Ethereal marauders live and hunt on the Ethereal Plane. Ethereal marauders’ coloration ranges from bright blue to deep violet. An ethereal marauder stands about 4 feet tall, but its overall length is about 7 feet. It weighs about 200 pounds.
Ethereal marauders speak no known languages. Survivors of their attacks on the Material Plane claim that they emit an eerie, high whine that varies in pitch depending on the creature’s speed and health. They are often kept as pets by Nilshai.
