One of the highest-ranking levels of Baatezu in all Baator, cornugons (KORN-yoo-gon) are those who have ascended through the ranks of their fellows by way of countless generations of betrayal, self-sacrifice, deception, and all manner of vices. Covered with tiny horns, wearing a huge pair of wings, and heavily muscled, they look like stupid creatures and often play on that to their advantage - they are, in fact, deeply intelligent creatures, and there's no telling how deep their schemes might run.
