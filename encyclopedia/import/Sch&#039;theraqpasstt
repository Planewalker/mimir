Sch'theraqpasstt was a lesser god, some say the creator of the yuan-ti race. Desiring to gain ultimate power, it conducted a ceremony designed to completely merge its mind with that of the 111th Layer of the Abyss, becoming a sentient, infinite realm. It got what it wanted, but the raw chaos of the Abyss drove it completely insane, so mentally ill it is unable to do much of anything. The layer is now called the Mind of Evil, a place where reality itself is so insane and capricious almost no life can survive. 
Sch'theraqpasstt survives as a demonic entity, a much-reduced aspect of its full power manifesting as a 60' long winged serpent. Even in this form, it occasionally lapses into complete idiocy.
