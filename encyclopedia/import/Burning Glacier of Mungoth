Mungoth is the third Layer of Gehenna, as cold as the first two layers are hot.
The great glacier on this layer is one of the few level places there for the Tanar'ri and Baatezu to fight, so fight they do. It's a treacherous place full of mudslides and unexpected crevasses, moving as much as 30 feet in a day. Yet it's better by far than most of the alternatives.
The "burning" part of the glacier's name refers to acid. Just saying.
