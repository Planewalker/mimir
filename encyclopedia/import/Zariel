Zariel was ruler of Avernus until a few thousand years ago, when she was deposed by her chief warlord, a Pit Fiend called Bel. He imprisoned her beneath his new palace and is slowly draining her of her power. Now he is the Lord of the First in all but name. 
The fireballs of Avernus are said to be manifestations of Zariel's helpless rage.
