Bytopia, known as the Twin Paradises and the Land of Just Rewards, are pure Good with overtones of Law. It has two layers, Shurrock and Dothion. Shurrock is wilderness, while Dothion is cultivated. These paradises face one another; each is the other's heaven. The highest mountains connect them.
Rather than merely being opposites (although they are that), Shurrock and Dothion represent a complementary pair. Shurrock is raw materials in nature and Dothion is civilization, craftsmanship. Both are needed, and they act in concert. 
In a larger sense, Bytopia is any cooperative group. It is fair trade, fair wages, hard work, industry, and community. All deals made in Bytopia tend to be mutually beneficial. Raw materials are mined or harvested from Shurrock, and finished goods are traded back. 
Bytopia's cooperation is Good's answer to the cruel exploitation of Gehenna, the codependent counterpart of the independent Beastlands, and the diametric opposite of the betrayal of Carceri.
Bytopia contains the Gnomish pantheon (among other gods), intelligent trees, the souls of many domesticated animals, and the spirits of all those who believe in fairness and cooperation between equals as the highest good. 
Although they will not let others starve or suffer, the people of Bytopia do not commonly give charity: they expect people to work for what they get. In this way, they agree with the least selfish of the Fated.
