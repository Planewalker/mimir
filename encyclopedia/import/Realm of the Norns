The Realm of the Norns lies in the Outlands near the Gate-town of Faunel. It lies within a grove a trees and is centered on the Well of Urd (often considered the actual name of the Realm), a scrying pool used by the Norns (sometimes called the Three Fates) of the Norse Pantheon. The pool can reveal the fate of any being in the Multiverse.
