As the first man to die, Yama became the Vedic+Pantheon's lord and judge of the dead. His palace Yamasadena and his city Yamapura are his Realm and are located in Mechanus on a cog that interlocks with those of Varuna and Rudra. Between the land of the living and his kingdom flows the bloody river Vaitarani, which all spirits must cross on their way to Yama’s judgment seat. After Yama has considered the spirit’s deeds in life, he decides what form the spirit’s new body should take. When Yama’s judgment is complete, the spirit goes to its new body in the world of the living. (Sometimes, in the cases of the very wicked, this journey takes the spirit through 21 hells of fire, filth, icy winds, thorns, etc.) Only those who have achieved unity with Brahman escape Yama’s judgment. Yama has the power to see a man’s entire history at a glance. In his true form, he is a green-skinned man with copper-colored eyes. He is usually dressed in red and is often seen riding his giant water buffalo.
Yama’s duties as judge of the dead keep him too busy to interfere in human affairs. No amount of praying or beseeching on the part of a mortal will influence his judgment, though he will often listen to another god’s opinion in regards to the fate of a dead person. Those who are likely to die soon often receive visits from one of his four-eyed dogs, an owl, or a pigeon.
