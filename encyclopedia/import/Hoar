Hoar is a god of Toril. In the Untheric pantheon there, he is known as Assuran. He is god of poetic justice, retribution, and revenge.
His fortress in Mechanus, the Doomcourt, is made of marble and covered in frost. Heads surround it, mounted on pikes, each representing someone who had offended the god.
