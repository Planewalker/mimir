Simpathetics[/b] are crow-like beings native to the Abyss (though some say they hail from Maladomini). They feed on good emotions, leaving behind nothing but violence and greed. 
Simpathetic feathers are mottled brown and gold, but a blood-red streak marks the edges of its wings and tail. Its eyes gleam with crimson malice.
