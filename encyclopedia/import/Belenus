Belenus is a celtic Power of the sun and of fire, a patron of the druids. He has the ability to control the heat and light from fires and from the sun, bringing them into focus to destroy or blocking them off to freeze when he wishes. In May, the Celts drive cattle through special Beltain fires while Belenus watches with favor and raises the overall quality of the livestock. Belenus encourages the construction of standing stones to measure the progress of his sun and sacred groves where his druids may meet and build great bonfires to him.
Belenus sends his avatar to the world of men frequently to visit with chieftains and court the ladies of the Celts. He can look unfavorably upon a particular village and cause the sun to stand still or never come up for some period of time. With such powers, he can easily bring otherwise powerful chieftains in line with his thinking. 
He shares a Realm, the Isles of the Blessed, with Brigantia on Elysium's fourth Layer, Thalasia.
