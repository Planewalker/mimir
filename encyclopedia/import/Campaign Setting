For the Egyptian god, see Set.
Planescape is a campaign setting originally made for 2nd edition Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons (abbr. AD&amp;D). This means that it is a set of locations and characters common to each campaign that is carried out within that setting. In short, Planescape ties together every campaign setting made for D&amp;D and the real world into a mythological whole, doing its best to mend the many conflicting ideas with new thoughts.
Planescape thus created a fascinating experiment trying to expand the founding philosophy of D&amp;D into somehing more.
