The hydroloths (HI-dro-loth) live somewhat outside the normal hierarchies of yugoloths armies, in that they live in and patrol the River Styx, exclusively. Hydroloths can be found nearly anywhere in the Lower Planes, from Pandemonium to Acheron, however most of them are found on Gehenna or the Gray Waste. There are some rumors that say that the ultroloths use the hydroloths as spies in the Blood War. However, this information is highly dubious, given the general intellect of the average hydroloth. They are the only creatures known to be able to swim in the Styx without losing their memories.
They are squat humanoids, about 10 feet tall, with large flaps of skin under their arms. They have frog-like faces and warty, yellow skin.
