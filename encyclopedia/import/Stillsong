An unearthly chorus of voices beyond those of mortal beings, rapturous melodies, and infinite harmonies of heart-rending beauty. 
Stillsong is a god in transition, currently manifesting itself as a sphere of purest song 40 feet in diameter. It left its name behind in prehistory. It has drowned in water and been reborn; it was crushed by earth and regrown; it was burned by fire and purified, and now it has all but finished its dissolution in the element of air and is reforming itself before submitting to a final judgement of the Creator Gods.Â  
It has an great affinity with delphons and moon+dogs, but much about it is a mystery. It wanders the Upper Planes, primarily along the length of the River Oceanus, but it has parallel manifestations in the Prime Material Plane and Elemental Plane of Air.
It may also be somehow connected to Water Lion.
Stillsong is neutral good. Its divine rank and portfolio are unknown. Its symbol is a transluscent golden crystal sphere.
