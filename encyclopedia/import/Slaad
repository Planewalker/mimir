Slaadi (singular: slaad) are creatures native to Limbo, usually toadlike or froglike in appearance but not always. They're beings of pure Chaos, the neutral equivalent of Tanar'ri and Eladrins. 
Like their equivalents on other planes (Archons, Rilmani, Tanar'ri, Baatezu, yugoloths, guardinals, modrons, and Eladrins), slaadi have many subtypes based on increased understanding of the alignment they personify. Slaadi are known by their colors: mud, red, gormeel, blue, green, gray, death, white, and black. I don't know what color "gormeel" is. 
Slaadi seek to create chaos and anarchy wherever they go. They are rivals of the Githzerai who share their plane, but not always enemies. Their own society is a constant struggle for dominance. Individual slaadi sometimes take up other pursuits, like writing. In the Upper Planes slaadi may appear to be evil-leaning, while in the Lower Planes they may tend toward good.
At irregular periods they travel to a site called the Spawning Stone to fertilize one another's egg sacs. All slaadi can lay eggs, but only red, blue, and mud slaadi are parasitic.
The most powerful of the slaadi are godlike beings known as the Lords of Chaos.
