The Suel are an ethnic group from the Greyhawk campaign setting.  Also called Suloise, Suel features are characterized by fair skin, blue, violet, or gray eyes, and platinum blond, blond, or light red hair.  Descendants in the tropics are heavily freckled.
At war with the Baklunish, the Suel Imperium was decimated by the Rain of Colorless Fire, which reduced the Suloise empire to a vast desert called the Sea of Dust.  Now the Suel are scattered throughout the Flanaess, the Amedio Jungle, and Hepmonaland.
