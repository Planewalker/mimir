Camazotz is the Central+American god of bats and horrible things that fly at night. Appearing as a huge bat surrounded by a cloud of normal bats, he has a dual aspect - he is both a ravenous monster that spreads plagues and sickness and a benign flyer whose servants eat crop-destroying insects. He can be appeased by offerings of insect plagues. As Zotzilaha, he is also a god of vampirism and the underworld. 
On the world of Oerth, Camazotz is worshipped by the Olman people. It was he who "gifted" the kingdom of Telaneteculi, creating a kingdom of werebats where once only humans reigned. 
Camazotz dwells in the World Below, which some claim exists on a parallel Material+Plane.
