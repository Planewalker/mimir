Lupercio is an Abyssal+lord, called the Baron of Sloth. A son of Pale Night and
an unknown father, he is also the embodiment of the strength of darkness. The darkness of his body spills for miles, with only his
smiling maw visible to his victims. Shadow fiends cluster around him,
eagerly feeding on his limitless shadows. His home layer, the Slugbed, is covered with his
filth and dung, but also contains clouds of radiance, beautiful forests
and graceful castles - there is no overriding theme. Sometimes his
presence oozes onto other layers of the Abyss; Lupercio seems to hardly
know the difference.
