In Egyptian mythology, Hathor is the cosmic cow-goddess, taking the form of a cow or human-cow hybrid. She is the daughter of Ra and wife of Bes.
Hathor's influence has extended to childbirth, dance, fate, folk music, love, moon, motherhood, and poetry. 
Her Realm, Succor, is in the first layer of Elysium, Amoria.
