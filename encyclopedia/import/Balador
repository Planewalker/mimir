Balador, Father Bear, is god of werebears, wise and thoughtful. He is the masculine counterpart to his sister Ferrix, goddess of weretigers. Balador has good friends among the fey and elven pantheons, as well as those human deities who understand how valuable werebears can be to the forests and woodlands.
In myth, Balador is often the servitor of a greater nature or druidic deity. He roams the Beastlands, with his lair, Ursis, in Brux. He takes his food from the rivers and lakes, sometimes persuading other deities to brew honeyed mead for him. His only enemies are Daragor, Eshebala, and Squerrik.
