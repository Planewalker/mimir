Portals are one of the fastest and most common ways of traveling the Multiverse. Generally a portal is a two-way (sometimes one-way), two-dimensional field inside a bounded space, binding two different locations to one another. A portal can cross between planes. The majority of portals have one fixed destination, although some may have multiple possible endpoints.
Many portals go through Sigil, but many don't. 
Some portals need a Portal Key to function, but then again some do not--except the Sigillian ones. They always need a key. 
Other ways of travelling between planes include: conduits, color+pools, vortices, planar+paths, and the occasional spell. Dying is another way of crossing planes, but you'll probably end up a Petitioner, and that isn't always for the best.
