The Aztec and Maya presented the world with an interesting set of closely related gods, goddesses, and creatures. The beings are just as evil or just as good as those in other mythoi, but they are not moved by anything resembling human thoughts or feelings. They act only upon their own inscrutable motives.
These beings are said to come from the stars of the Prime Material Plane. Their worshippers believe in a 'world above,' which includes the stars, planets, and clouds, and a 'world below,' where Mictlantecuhtli rules over the dead. The gods of the World Above can even be visited with spelljammers, if one is willing to risk their wrath.
