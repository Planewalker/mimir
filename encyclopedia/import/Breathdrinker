The breathdrinker is a dreadful Elemental that feeds on air extracted from the lungs of living creatures. Breathdrinkers are normally invisible, except when attacking - at that time, they take on the form of a misty, translucent duplicate of their victims. Their eyes appear as tiny red spheres of light.
Breathdrinkers are native to the Elemental Plane of Air. They are the favored assassins for some wicked priests.
