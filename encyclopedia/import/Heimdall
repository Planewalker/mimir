Heimdall is the Norse Power of the dawn light and guardians. He is the son of Odin and the nine Tempests, each a daughter of Aegir. Heimdall was born on the horizon and nurtured on the strength of the earth, the moisture of the sea, and the warmth of the sun. He has the power to see a hundred miles by day or night, and his hearing is so sensitive that he can hear grass growing on the Prime+Material. Heimdall dwells in Himinborg, a city located atop the bridge Bifrost, which connects the Prime Material Plane and Asgard. In his true form, he is a strapping warrior in white armor. He carries a flashing sword and the famous alarm horn, Gjallerhorn.
Heimdall’s main duty is guarding the rainbow bridge, Bifrost. He will not allow anybody to cross it without Odin’s express permission. He is the one who will summon the other gods to Ragnarok by blowing upon Gjallerhorn. Heimdall is the sworn enemy of Loki, and will always send his avatar to aid mortals caught up in the mischief god’s plots.
