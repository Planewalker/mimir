The lumi believe themselves to have formed from the primal light of the
creation of the Multiverse. Light is indistiguishable from truth in
their minds, and they have made it their mission to destroy all
falsehood from the multiverse. Ultimately, this means the extermination
of everything outside the Positive+Energy+Plane and the [[Plane of
Radiance]], but for now they rally their numbers to concentrate on those
who wield negative+energy and Shadow, and known deceivers.
