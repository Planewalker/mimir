The capital of the efreet, the City of Brass is built on a hovering hemisphere of solid brass fully forty miles across, and protected by a brass wall with eight gates. The whole city glows hotly at all times; only the power of the efreet keep it from melting away in the heat of the Elemental+Plane+of+Fire. The city is built on a delta formed from a river of magma. 
Also on the hemisphere are the Obsidian Fields, where the efreet grow crops native to their plane, and the Sable Forest, where the efreeti nobles go to hunt. 
The city itself is one of the wealthiest planar metropolises in all the Multiverse.
