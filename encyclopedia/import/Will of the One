The Will of the One are a subgroup (or fraction) within the Sign of One faction who believe the One is incarnate in the form of a Bariaur named Terwolfe.
Terwolfe's interpreter and high priestess (of a sort) is a water Genasi called Prisine.
As the proported One, the being who dreams the rest of the Multiverse into existence, Terwolfe will make predictions which seem to continually come true. Soon, the Will of the One plan to demonstrate their dreamer's power by resurrecting a dead god. There is some debate within the order over which god it should be - the most favored candidates are Aoskar and Enki. On the one hand, anyone who resurrected Aoskar would surely draw the wrath of the Lady of Pain. On the other hand, what better proof of Terwolfe's power could there be than drawing down the Lady's wrath and surviving it? 
Also associated with the Will of the One are the Linqua Omott and the Dabus Fell.
