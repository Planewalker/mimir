Phaulkon is a lesser deity of Oerth presiding over air, archery, birds, clouds, and wind. Phaulkon is the father of Kord, conceiving him with Syrul. He is chaotic good.
He is sometimes seen in the elvish realm Arvandor, where his friend Aerdrie Faenya often dwells, but also wanders the Elemental Plane of Air. His worshipers often team up with Murlynd in order to destroy ancient devices of war, and he is a staunch ally of Jascar in the battle against evil.
