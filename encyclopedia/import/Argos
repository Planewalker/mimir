Believed to be related to beholders and gibbering mouthers, argos resemble giant amoebas with one large central eye, a hundred lashless, inhuman eyes, and many sharp-toothed mouths. Their eyes, like beholder eyes, have a variety of special powers. Their colors tend toward transparent blues and violets, and they smell like flowers. Though they are intelligent, they do not wear clothes, storing equipment in temporary cavities within their bodies (though their digestive juices ruin objects stored in there for too long). They are ravenous creatures driven by their hunger. It's not unheard to see them in the employ of their beholder kin. 
It is likely that they are descended from, and worship, the Great Mother.
