Kriesha, the Winter Witch, is a goddess of the Cerilian Pantheon who dwells in Stygia, the fifth of the hells of Baator. She is a cruel goddess who permits only the strong to survive and demands absolute obedience from her followers.
Her Realm in Stygia is a place of breathtaking, icy beauty, where crystalline glaciers terminate in palaces of ice and frost where her favored souls are permitted to dwell. Outside are the cold wind and the wolves.
