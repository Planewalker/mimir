Sword archons are winged Archons, messengers and warriors of Mount Celestia. Their hands transform into swords burning with holy flame. They used to have the heads of hunting cats, but in this era this seems not to be the case. 
Two sword archons, fallen from good but not into evil, serve Zadara the Titan.
