It is said that Sheyanna is the source of the rivalry between Garl and
Gelf, for both woo her in many Gnome legends. Sheyanna doesn't commit
to either brother, however, choosing instead to encourage matchmaking
and passionate affairs among the mortal gnomes in her care. Thus a
romantic triangle is formed -- a triangle that has launched a thousand
folk tales. Sheyanna is said to be the ideal of gnome beauty, a
delicate blonde princess with a smile that melts even Gelf's icy heart.
Sheyanna is often depicted with Hearthlight, a golden torch that can spew a fountain of flame wherever she aims it.
Sheyanna is chaotic good. The name and location of her divine realm are unknown.
