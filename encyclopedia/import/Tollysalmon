Tollysalmon is a former Githyanki knight, once a faithful minion of the Lich+Queen+Vlaakith who abandoned her post, convinced of its meaninglessness, and became Factol of the Bleak Cabal in Sigil. Once she succumbed to the Grim Retreat, she was imprisoned in the Criminally and Irretrievably Insane wing of the Gatehouse along with her predecessor, Esmus. There, her innate psionic powers have grown more powerful than ever before, fueled by her madness. She's become immune to death, superstitious Bleakers whisper, and what's more she's escaped.
