Tempus is a greater deity on the world of Toril. He is god of battle, berserkers, duels, plunder, warriors, and war. He is chaotic neutral.
His Realm, Warrior's Rest (also called Knight's Rest), is on the wild, everchanging Plane of Limbo. It resembles an enormous battlefield similar to a rocky desert, with mesas, buttes, and unusual outcroppings towering over the mostly flat land. As in the rest of the plane, the land can be shaped by those with high wisdom, though not to the same degree as elsewhere in Limbo. It erupts in constant battles and random shifts of terrain. It is full of Petitioners eternally making war with one another, like in Asgard. The petitioners in Warrior's Rest regenerate like trolls, but death, for them, is permanent.
Other inhabitants of Warrior's Rest include Githzerai, titans, and Khaasta.
