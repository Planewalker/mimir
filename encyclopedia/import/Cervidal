Cervidals[/b] are the most common of guardinals, resembling humans with magnificent horns or antlers and hooflike feet. They're the most common celestial beings in Amoria, Elysium's nearest Layer.
These guardinals are the most peaceful of the guardinals and the last to join in a fight, but they aren't cowards and they'll remain with their companions to the last.
