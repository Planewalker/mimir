Salamander orchids are beautiful plants native to the Elemental+Plane+of+Fire. They resemble Prime Material orchids, but their stalks and leaves are made of brass and their blossoms are made of gold and crimson flame. This fire moves unusually slowly, more like a liquid than a gas. Salamander orchids can only survive on the Prime+Material if they're "watered" with highly refined, expensive oils, but they can be cultivated rather easily on their home plane. They have appeared in gardens in the City of Brass.
