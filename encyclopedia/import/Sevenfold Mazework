The Sevenfold Mazework is a trading center, court, city, and palace in the center of the Great Dismal Delve. 
It is, as its name suggests, a great maze riddled with Portals to distant regions, with secret doors, spy chambers, and storage areas. It stretches on for miles and miles, winding in all three dimensions (and more than that). It's said to confuse even the minotaurs the Dao keep as slaves, but noble dao understand it instinctively. 
The Sevenfold Mazework has seven parts: the first is home to thousands of Dao and their tens of thousands of slaves. Light is provided by great shining gems. The second are populated by minor hetmen and atamen, the third maze is a set of mirrored halls made to impress visitors; the fourth is a reverse maze, the fifth is a maze of force magic; the sixth was created by the gods of elemental earth; the seventh is made up of tunnels so tiny they can only be traveled in gaseous form - this is the location of the palace of the Great Khan of the dao.
