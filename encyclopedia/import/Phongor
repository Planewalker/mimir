Phongor is the most feared devil in Nessus, after Asmodeus himself; he serves Asmodeus as inquisitor, and little information escapes his probing questions and methods of persuasion. He has subverted the spies of Adramalech and recruited spies of his own throught the planes.
Phongor appears as a dead-white skinned man with glittering pink eyes, a hoarse, hissing voice, tiny horns and oily black hair, a forked tail, and red hooves. He wears open purple or black robes, and a belt to carry his whip.
