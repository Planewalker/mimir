The Fourth Door is one of four doors believed tied to the destruction of Aoskar in some way.  When it manifests every 500 years, it is located in the Lady's+Ward in Sigil in a structure known simply as the Tower.  The door is fashioned from heavy wood and has no knocker, handle or keyhole; it is covered with strange glyphs that cannot be deciphered, even with magic.
