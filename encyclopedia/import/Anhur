Few powers can match the fury of Anhur, war god of the Egyptian Pantheon. However, unlike many war gods, he is a force for good. Like Horus, he fights on against the forces of evil and seldom, ever, loses. The wrath of Anhur is slow coming, for his wisdom is as legendary his ability to make war, but it is inescapable once earned.
In his true form, Anhur is a mighty figure with four arms. He is often seen with a powerful lance that requires both his right arms to wield and which is tipped with a fragment of the sun. When he sends his avatars into the world of men, they carry this weapon with them.
Anhur is a deity, but one who is not quick to pass judgment on others. He expects his followers, especially his priests, to engage forces of evil wherever they find them. Rather than fighting one another, as the Norse petitioners do, Anhur's Petitioners travel to the Abyss, the Gray Waste, and other lower planes. There is no excuse for failure. 
Anhur's small Realm is called Netaph and is located on Ysgard. Netaph is on the same earthberg as the realm of Bast. Only ancient weapons and equipment are available there, but all schools of magic are enhanced. Old forms of magic thrive in Netaph, many of them long since forgotten.Â  Netaph is also known for its many birds of prey.
