One of the Hive's most popular Bub houses, the Bottle and Jug, is without a doubt its most notorious.  The place isn't known for its pleasantness, and its owner Barl Hoxun doesn't take any nonsense (for more information see In the Cage:  A Guide to Sigil pages 107-110).
People in the Bottle and Jug can either fight each other or go against the house champion, a large, one-eyed giant-kin.  If you beat the house champion, you get the right to use of the tavern's four Portals to the elemental+planes.
