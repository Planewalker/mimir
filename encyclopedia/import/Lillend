Lillends (alternate plural: lillendi) are celestials with the lower bodies of serpents and humanoid upper torsos. Their bodies are covered with tattoos, and they habitually wear elaborate masks. Each lillend knows the day she will die.
All lillends are female, though they may not look it.
Lillends are guardians of the Infinite Staircase and the Gates of the Moon. They are patrons of the arts, flourishing among creativity of any type.
