Movanic devas[/b] are devas who are sent to the Prime+Material and Energy Planes to aid mortal followers of the deities they worship in moments of dire need. They have milky white skin and silvery hair and eyes, but seldom appear in their natural forms unless they see a particular use in the shock value of their Celestial appearance.
