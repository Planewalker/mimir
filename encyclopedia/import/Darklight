WhenÂ the spirit of an evil mortal leaves its body upon death, but does not become a petitioner and loses its way to its final rest, it may arrive at the Quasiplane of Radiance where it is filled with radiant energy and becomes a darklight, a free-willed undead being. They appear as man-shaped specters of blackness with bright, shining eyes of everchanging colors.
