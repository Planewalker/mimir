The Zactars are a long-forgotten Faction that teach that everything in the Multiverse was created for the benefit of an entity they call the One True Being. They believe this being will take the form of a half-fiendish female.
Their headquarters, the Zactar+Cathedral, is a ruined building in the Lower Ward. The faction died out long ago, but was recently revived to some extent when an Alu-Fiend called Umbra was born and seemed to fulfill the prophecy. 
The faction was named for Zactar, its cambion founder.
