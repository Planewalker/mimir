Bargrivyek the Peacemaker is a lesser god of the goblin Pantheon. He urges the various goblin clans to unite against their common enemies rather than fight one another. He seeks only peace between goblins; he loves the idea of war with other races.
He is on excellent terms with Khurgorbaeyag, but fears Maglubiyet and Nomog-Geaya.
His Realm, the Peaceable Lands, is in Avernus. Here the deity trains his armies and leads them on raids against Draukari, the realm of Kurtulmak.
