Egder is the huge eagle that roosts in the uppermost branches of Yggdrasil on the Astral Plane, guarding the World Treeâ€™s trunk and branches from all vandals. The great bird stands forever on guard (and is thus never surprised), and on his beak a great falcon, Vedrfolnir, sits, also keeping watch. Those foolish enough to tamper with Yggdrasil will be subjected to an attack by both birds.
There is great enmity between Egder and Nidhogg. This enmity is fostered by the ratatosks, the only known beings that successfully climb the length of Yggdrasil from the Gray Waste to Ysgard on a regular basis.
