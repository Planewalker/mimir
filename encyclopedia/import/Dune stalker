They are tall, gaunt, naked humanoids with unusually large, ovoid-shaped heads, extremely long arms and legs, and razor-sharp claws on their hands and feet. Their skin is reddish-orange and extremely dry and abrasive to the touch. Their eyes are large, their nose are narrow and long.  Their chests are abnormally broad at the top, narrowing to a relatively tiny waist. They have no hair whatsoever, and do not sweat. Their bones are strong, made up of many hollow tubes spiraling around one another to form an extremely strong bundle. Their hides are too abrasive to make desirable garments, but it does make very durable sandpaper.
Their principle attack is a sonic vibration, but they can also, at close range, deliver a "kiss of death."
Dune stalkers wander their plane in nomadic tribes, attacking dust quasielementals on sight.
