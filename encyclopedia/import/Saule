A neutral sun goddess of the Baltic, Finnish, and Eurasian pantheons, Saule is the wife of Meness.Â  Her portfolio also includes childbirth, weaving, and music, and is worshipped by bards.
Saule, also called Saule Mate, manifests as a golden-haired woman dressed in golden robes, pouring out a jug filled with sunlight. She rides across the sky in a golden chariot drawn by two white horses, just as her husband Meness rides in a silver chariot drawn by a gray horse.
