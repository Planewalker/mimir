Known as Lords of Stone, Those Who Wait, Rock Fathers, Old Men of the Mountains and even Hearts of Steadfast Stone, the dharum suhn are spirits inhabiting the element of earth, embodying concepts of stability, strength, endurance, wisdom, contemplation and immovability. Said to be on the verge of being demi-powers, these beings fall beyond the purviews of the earth archomentals, Sunnis and Ogremoch, and are not involved in their conflicts.
