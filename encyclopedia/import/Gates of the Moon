The Gates of the Moon[/b] is a realm in the first layer of Ysgard, the domain of the gods Sel√ªne of Toril and Soma of the Indian Pantheon. It is protected by lillends and shards.
The River Oceanus flows into the Gates during periods of high tide. When the moon is full, the Infinite Staircase manifests in this realm as well. 
The realm of Selune is a shining hall called Argentil, located in the center of the realm. The hall is a place of quiet beauty, and the moonlight seems to suffuse all objects with an unearthly glow.
With Selune's blessing, Soma's petitioners distill the juice of special flowers that grow around the realm; chant is that those who taste the droplets gain insight into the future.
Werecreatures are able to control their transformations fully under the light of the Moon Gates.
