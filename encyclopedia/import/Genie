Genies, also known as jinn (singular: jinni), are dangerous Elemental beings, embodiments of magic in its four elemental provinces. They are capricious, arrogant, and very, very powerful. They speak the elemental tongues as well as their own language, Jannti.
Genies may take mortal lovers, sometimes producing Genasi, but the
outcome is almost always tragic. Those who love genies lose all sense
of reason and judgement and are often destroyed by their love for such
a powerful spirit.
