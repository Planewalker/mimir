Chupoclops was one of the Elder+Evils of the Forgotten Realms setting, a vast ethereal spider who fed on ghosts and gave birth to nightmares. 
It was finally slain by seven heroes, a mixed band comprised of both good and evil souls, both living and ghosts. On each day of the week-long battle, one of the heroes died. On the seventh day the last hero dealt the killing blow before dying himself.
Chupoclops passed from the known planes, becoming a Vestige.
