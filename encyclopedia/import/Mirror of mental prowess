A spying tool and a portal in one, this ordinary-looking magic mirror enables those who know the proper commands to scry and enter other planes, stepping through to the place pictured. The other side of the portal is invisible, and anyone can step back through if the correct spot can be found - at which point, the portal closes, trapping everyone else on the other side.
Perhaps its magic is related to the Plane+of+Mirrors.
