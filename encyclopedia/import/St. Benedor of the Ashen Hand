St. Benedor of the Ashen Hand is a demigod of Oerth. He is neutral good. His creator intended him to be one of the nine demigods imprisoned by Zagyg, but this is not part of the official canon.
Formerly, he was Sir Benedor Monlath of Chathold. Born in the later half of the 2nd century CY, he was a legendary Knight Commander of the Knight Protectors of the Great Kingdom. He has been the mortal foe of St+Kargoth since 203 CY when Kargoth became a death knight. 
St. Benedor's name comed from the fact that he was blinded by, and his hand seared by, the artifact known as the Orb of Sol, an object sacred to Pelor. He is patron saint of the Knight Protectors of the Great Kingdom, and of valor, self-sacrifice, underdogs, and perseverance.
