Zagyg, the Mad Archmage, is a god of humor, eccentricity, and occult lore worshipped by some few on  the world of Oerth. He is a servant of Boccob. As a mortal wizard he imprisoned nine demigods, bound the demon prince Fraz-Urb'luu in a clown's face, and once bested the god Olidammara.
Zagyg wanders the Multiverse. He is responsible for the creation of many odd Demiplanes.
