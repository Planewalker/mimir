The City Barracks is located in The Lady's Ward of Sigil and was the Harmonium's headquarters prior to the Faction War. It is a restful place, the streets near the the Barracks are even empty, quiet and serene: the Hardheads don't like crowds. That peace is punctuated by the imposing presence of crushing granite of the headquarters.
The building looks heavy, dull and impenetrable with a single guarded entrance; four sentries stands before the arched doorway ready to stop and challenge visitors. The Barracks is an immensely long quadrangle that gives an impression of strength but, because the lack of spikes, gargoyles and other ornamentation, it doesn't inspire deep terror.
Hardheads want to make converts, so patrols sometimes literally take bashers off the streets and into the Barracks, where they are broken and "reforged" into members of the Harmonium machine. Given the Hardheads' attitude it's no surprise streets are often empty and calm.
Taverns and inns in the area follow strictly the Harmonium official line: all is regular, chaos minions are kept out and entertainment will put a berk to sleep quickly; only certain songs, plays and jokes have the approval of Harmonium censors.</font>
All of that was before the Faction War. Since that time, the City Barracks has been the base of operations for Sigil's newly formed City Guard, a force of about 300 guardsmen led by Watch Captain Danthis Highmoon.
