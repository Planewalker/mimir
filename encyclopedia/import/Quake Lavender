Quake, a Half-elf, is a wild mage of the first order. According to the chant around the Cage, she received her training from the famed mage Horung the Anarch (whom she recruited into the Xaositects not long ago) and by Horung's former apprentice, Nahal the Incorrigible. 
She's a Factor in the Xaositects, and runs a tavern in the Hive called Quake's Place.
