Tlaloc is a Central+American god of rain and moisture, very similar to Azul. Tlaloc has a snakelike head with prominent tusks and carries an obsidian sword. He is married to Chalchihuitlicue, who convinced him to create the paradise of Tlalocan in Abellio, Arcadia for the victims of death by water.
Tlaloc is a cruel deity in many ways who delights in the torture of innocents. 
On the world of Oerth he is responsible for the creation of yuan-ti.
Tlaloc dwells on the tops of the highest mountains of the Prime Material Plane on a world other than Oerth.
