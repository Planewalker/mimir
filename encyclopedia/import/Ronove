Ronove is said to be the founder of the modern monastic orders among the multiverse. A powerful ascetic, her philosophies centered around rejection of physical needs, then physical laws, and finally the rejection of reality itself. The idea worked, for she could leap great chasms, lift boulders with a thought, and go for weeks without nourishment.                                                            
When her disciples began to doubt her abilities, Ronove made them believe. She locked herself in an iron coffin, which was buried. Her disciples would receive a signal to unearth her some time in the future. Buts years passed, and no sign came. Finally, one of her followers dug up the coffin, and found it empty. Ronove is believed to have slipped out of reality, and has become a Vestige.
