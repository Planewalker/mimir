Shades were once humanoids, but they traded their souls for the essence of shadowstuff, the element of the Plane+of+Shadow. This gives them immortality and supernatural powers tied to darkness and shade. In bright light, they are but ordinary mortals. 
Shades resemble the mortals they once were, but all color is leached from their skin.
Famous shades include Zol Darklock, an ancient warrior-mage from the world of Oerth. Many shades worship Shar or Erebus.
