Dakarnok is a demigod servant of Kurtulmak. In life, Dakarnok was a shaman/chieftain who conquered all the other kobold gens near his own tribe, and then moved against human and gnome settlements scattered along his frontier. He enjoyed considerable military success, specializing in fast, light raids.
It is said that Dakarnok gained godhood through the use of certain magical devices; whatever the means, upon his death his people continued to revere him.
Dakarnok is usually depicted as an unusually muscular kobold with silver-black scales and tiny red eyes, wielding a spiked club made from oak.
