The Palace of Judgment in the Outlands is the most bustling part of the Celestial Bureaucracy, and home of more Portals than anywhere but Sigil. It is the realm of Yen-Wang-Yeh, judge of the dead.
Me-zu oni, Go-zu oni, spirit+centipedes, and other spirits serve as enforcers and examiners of petitioners in this Realm, which is entangled with red tape and stiflingly boring if you're not dead (or even if you are ). Some petitioners have been known to try to escape.
