Visages are undead tanar’ri, fiendish demons brought back to life by their horrible lord now known as Tenebrous. The former demon lord created them to be his eyes and ears, to infiltrate society and do his dirty will. Visages have the power to literally warp a poor berk’s senses anyway they please, often turning the Sod’s mind inside out. Visages is a master of illusion and deception, and they serve Tenebrous well. They are powered by a link to their Lord, not to the Negative+Material+Plane, so they maybe encountered anywhere.
A visage in its natural form appears to be a creature composed of wispy, dark shadow stuff, with ghastly white masks for heads and no legs. However, a person seeing the visage’s natural form will most likely be killed in order for the Visage to assume his identity and place in society.
