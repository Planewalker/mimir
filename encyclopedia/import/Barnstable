Barnstable is a halfling village. It was built in the Material+Plane, but it slid into Limbo not because of its alignment, but in one of the weird accidents that are all too common where Limbo is concerned. 
The people of Barnstable lack any anarchs, so they have to sleep in shifts to assure that their village doesn't destabilize in the night (or what passes for night in crazy, random Limbo). 
Also in Limbo are a jumble of boulders known as Yondalla's Teeth, named by halflings though it has nothing to do with their goddess.
