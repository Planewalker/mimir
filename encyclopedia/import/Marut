Maruts are one of the inevitables, a group of constructs dedicated to upholding universal law. Specifically, Maruts make sure that no one denies the inevitability of death. Maruts are known to have great patience, and will stand outside or in a structure for centuries until it can deal its unique brand of justice. Maruts are armed with many immunities and spell-like abilities to aid itself in battle.
The Marut's (and all inevitables') origins are sketchy. Some attribute their creation to the Hindu god Rudra; but others point to the mysterious creche-forges scattered across Mechanus.
