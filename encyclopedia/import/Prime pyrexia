The first time a character from the Prime Material Plane visits the Outer Planes or Sigil for a week or more, they risk getting prime pyrexia. Planars are immune. Something in the air of the weirder parts of the cosmos just doesn't agree with some primes.
Symptoms include fever and chills, followed by an ulcerated lump on the elbow or armpit. The nearby glands become painfully swollen and often burst with a vile green ooze. 
Prime pyrexia can last three to four weeks, accompanied by high fever and exhaustion. At the end of the time, the patient often dies from cardiac distress or pnemonia. 
Prime pyrexia is not contagious.
