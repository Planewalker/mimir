Bria Tomay is a bard who worked in a silversmith shop with her family. She was, before the Faction War, one of the most prominent leaders of the Free League, though they are a Faction without leaders.
She was exiled to the Mazes along with her wemic comrades Lethea and Lesander, simply for contemplating an alliance with the Fated in the war that the Lady of Pain supposedly didn't want to happen.
