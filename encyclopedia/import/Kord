Kord, god of strength, athletics, and courage, is an intermediate deity of Oerth, the son of Syrul and Phaulkon and the grandson of Lendor. He is chaotic good.
His favorite herald is a Titan. His allies include Bralani, Ghaele, and huge+earth+elementals.
Kord's Petitioners dwell in the Hall of the Valiant in Ysgard's first layer, a grand hall made of stout would where there's always a feast - or a wrestling match.
