Parched mouth comes from the consumption of contaminated food or water - this can be caused by the touch of a Fiend, Larva, or undead creature, or any other unclean situation a Blood may happen across. If examined closely, food infected by the disease appears to have a purplish tinge. Despoiled water or wine has a bland, almost dry texture.
Symptoms of parched mouth include a craving thirst, fierce vomiting, muscle cramps, circulatory collapse, and death.
