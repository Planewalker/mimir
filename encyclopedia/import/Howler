Howlers live in dark planes where chaos and evil hold sway, especially Pandemonium. They hunt in packs, racing through caverns to wear down their prey and rend it to bits.Â  A howler is about 8 feet long and weighs about 2,000 pounds. Although they are surprisingly intelligent, howlers do not speak- they only howl. If there is a language within the howls, as some have suggested, even spells cannot decipher it.
