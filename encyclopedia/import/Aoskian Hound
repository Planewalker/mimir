Few creatures thrive in Sigil. Cranium Rats, roaches and other vermin thrive but most creatures struggle against the human scavengers, collectors and ragmen.
One creature that has survived is the Aoskian Hound. Originally bred by the followers of Aoskar before the religon's dramatic fall from favour, the large two-headed hounds are commonly reared and trained as guard dogs. The blood of the dogs is rumoured to be useful as a component of certain magics relating to planar+pathways and Portals.
