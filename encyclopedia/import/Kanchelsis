The Vampire god Kanchelsis was said - in the most secret of myths - to have been created accidently when the Seldarine
attempted a ritual that involved sacrificing their own blood. This
blood was corrupted by a human god of evil, and the corrupted blood
became Kanchelsis, a being divided between his urbane, sophisticated
aspect - the Rake - and a savage horror known as the Beast. Kanchelsis
dwells in the Abyss in the layer catalogued as the 487th, the so-called Lair of the Beast and Mansion of the Rake.
