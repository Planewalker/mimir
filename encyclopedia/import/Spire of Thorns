The Spire of Thorns in the first Layer of Arborea, far from any Realm or settlement, is a single, poisonous bramble that has grown so tall and strong it has become a tower. The spire's thorns are coated in a poison that addles the wits and dulls the senses, but climbing all the way to the top is said to toughen the body against all toxins.
