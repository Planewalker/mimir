Narzugons are the Baatezu's elite cavalry that are sent to hunt down anybody that escaped Baator against the will of one of its Lords. They usually ride nightmares, but can sometimes be seen riding more unusual mounts such as greater barghests, fiendish dire boars, or even dragons in pursuit of their prey. The lesson of the narzugons is: Rely on lesser beings to help you, and play off the fears of others.
Physically, narzugons are gaunt, pale humanoids whose eyes betray an incomparable sorrow - but their gaze invokes one's worst fears, growing into a baleful hallucination that can kill. They are rarely seen without their trademark masterwork spiked plate armor.
