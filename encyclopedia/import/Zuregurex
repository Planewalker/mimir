Zuregurex was a Tanar'ri lord of storms and the drowned dead, the lord of the 480th Layer of the Abyss, Guttlevetch.
This demon led an army of undead and demonically-fused air elementals against Demogorgon's city of Lemoriax while the latter was consumed with an invasion against the Realm of Fraz-Urb'luu. In rage, Demogorgon destroyed his realm, sinking the islands and turning the waters against him. Zuregurex fled into the Scalding Sea to escape, though some say he has since returned in secret to rebuild his realm.
