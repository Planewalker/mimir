The Primals are a reclusive, little known Sect based in the Inner Planes. The Primals are thought to believe that the inner planes, as the source of all matter, are the ultimate source of the secrets underlying all of the multiverse.
The group is divided into several levels or circles of initiated knowledge, and is incredibly secretive in both its beliefs, goals, and activities. What little is known of them is that by study, or by revelation, members of the group tend to gain considerable sway over the composition of and nature of physical, material, matter (leading to powers such as disintegrate, etc).
