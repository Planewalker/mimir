This Realm in the Ethereal Plane is the home of the gods Solinari, Lunitari, and Nuitari. The gods inhabit citadels each built upon the surface of three massive moons that circle in a mutual trinary orbit. The moons share some mystical link with the moons of Krynn - they may even be in some sense one and the same.
This realm is where the three gods trained the first Wizards of High Sorcery, and it is where the gods of Good led their faithful clerics just before Krynn's Cataclysm.
