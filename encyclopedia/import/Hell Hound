Hell hounds are aggressive, fire-breathing canines of Baator. Specimens are frequently brought to the Prime Material Plane to serve evil beings, and many have established indigenous breeding populations. Hell hounds are efficient hunters. A favorite pack tactic is to surround prey quietly, then attack with one or two hounds, driving it toward the rest with their fiery breath. If the prey doesnâ€™t run, the pack closes in. Hell hounds track fleeing prey relentlessly.
