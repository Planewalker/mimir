Baba Yaga is a cannibalistic hag in Slavic legend. She cooks children, causes storms, and traverses the country with Death at her side. Some say she is a spirit of the forest. Some say she protects the waters of life. She flies through the sky in a mortar and pestle, carrying a club that turns men to stone. She lives in a hut with chicken legs.
Kostchtchie is in some sense her creation.
