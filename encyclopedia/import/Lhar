Lhar is a Half-orc born and raised in Sigil as an orphan in the Gatehouse. He rose to become Factol of the Bleak Cabal. Like all Bleaker factols, he succumbed to a time of madness known as the Grim Retreat. Unlike his predecessors Tollysalmon and Esmus, he prepared for it well in advance, and plans on riding the madness out and returning to his former position.
Because he stepped down as factol, he escaped the mazing that snared the other factols just before the Faction War.
