The sarrukh are one of the 'Creator Races' known to prehistoric Abeir-Toril. Resembling snakelike humanoids, they are responsible for the creation of many other reptilian humanoids, including yuan-ti, lizardfolk, and nagas. According to Serpent Kingdoms, a group of them migrated to Mount Celestia and became Couatl. 
The sarrukh are currently at war with the Khaasta.
