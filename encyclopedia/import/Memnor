Some myths say that Memnor is the brother of Annam, weakened by him in an epic battle and banished to Gehenna. Others say he was born from the head or guts of a vast, barely sentient, world-devouring monster vanquished by Annam or Stronmaus. Still others claim that he was Annam's son, and that when he was young, a game he played with Grolantor caused a minor war with the ogres.
Memnor is subtle, charming, intelligent, cunning, and deeply, intensely cruel. He wishes nothing less than to become lord of all giantkind. His worshippers are evil cloud giants. 
Memnor appears as a kindly, golden-skinned cloud giant with piercing eyes, wearing a robe of deep blue. His Realm in Chamada, the second Layer of Gehenna, is called Thraotor, an enormous thunderhead with a palace of adamantine at its peak, bringing storms wherever it goes.
