An illegitimate daughter of Zeus, the huntress Artemis is the greek Power of young girls, and the mistress of beasts and all wild things. She will have nothing to do with men, perhaps because she has often helped women in childbirth and blames men for all the pain involved. Although renowned as a huntress, Artemis kills only to feed herself and others, never for sport. In her true form, she is a slim young girl.
She dwells in the forests of Arborea, surrounded by a band of chaste and hardy nymphs. She has complete control over any non-magical animal while it is in the forests of Arborea. She has a small complex of caves in the side of Mount Olympus that she calls home, and frequently travels to Arkenos, city of the Amazons.
Artemis loves the rugged life of a huntress. Except for helping women during childbirth, she avoids involving herself in any other human matters. She values her privacy, and will severely punish any man violating it. Omens from Artemis are always delivered by wild beasts.
