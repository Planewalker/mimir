Windglum is a city of Banished in a cavern several miles wide and long in Phlegethon, the third Layer of Pandemonium, with enormous natural columns that hold up the cavern's ceiling. Hundreds of ever-burning globes provide light for the Burg, illuminating a disordered sprawl of individual Cases. The homes in turn surround a fortification known locally as the Citadel of Loros.
Windglum is characterized by an aura of suspicion. The locals are unlikely to trust strangers, and many of Windglum's citizens are mentally unstable. However, one inn in Windglum welcomes strangers. Called the Scaly Dog, it's a place where a planar traveler can meet other wayfarers, hire mercenaries, gather information, or seek employment.
