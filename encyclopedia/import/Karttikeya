Karttikeya has six heads and twelve arms and carries ten swords. This demigod was created by the Indian Pantheon to fight Baatezu and rakshasas wherever they are found.
Karttikeya rides a giant peacock with feathers made of metal. Its beak is said to strike with the swiftness of lightning. His Realm, known as the Fortunes of War, is a temple on an island in a lake of white, drinkable milk that is itself surrounded by an island floating through the first Layer of Ysgard.
