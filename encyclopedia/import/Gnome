Although most often found throughout the Upper Planes, planar gnomes tend to follow a few different paths. A great many tend to the quiet pastures of Arborea and the Outlands, living simple lives. Another significant portion become Guvner sages, spending their days pouring over ancient tomes with an almost joyful sense of exploration. The last major group is the often-maligned tinkerers. Among the magical landscapes of the planes, their clockwork machinery stands out as an eyesore in all but the gears of Mechanus. Interestingly enough, these disparate groups all co-exist quite well in Bytopia, where gnomes are perhaps the most plentiful race.
Most likely due to their tendencies towards a neutral alignment, the svirfneblin, also known as deep gnomes, are one of the few Underdark races commonly found in the caverns within the Elemental Plane of Earth. In fact, that's where they keep their real cities - enormous, fantastic places more glorious than anything they have on the Prime+Material. They have to watch out for Dao slaves, though.
