Like Surya and Savitri, Mitra is one of several Vedic solar powers. He embodies the beneficial aspects of the sun, providing light and warmth, and making plants grow. Mitra also helps Varuna safeguard the rita (cosmic order) by shining his light on all that occurs on earth, and by presiding over friendships and ratifying contracts. He has the power to shine his light anywhere on earth, to provide warmth when it is cold, and to make plants grow. In his true form, Mitra is the warmth and light of the sun.
Like Varuna, Mitraâ€™s primary concern is with rita, the cosmic order of the universe. During the daylight hours, he is constantly watching for any dharma violation which will upset the order. He is especially concerned with contractual promises and the duty owed by friends to each other, and will often cast a white hot light on any person committing an act which violates these duties. 
Mitra shares a Realm, Goldfire, with Surya on Mount Celestia's second Layer of Mercuria. Goldfire is a realm of constant radiance neighboring Vishnu's
realm, the Divine Lotus. Rich and fertile jungles fill much of it, and
its light destroys all undead and illuminates all invisible creatures. Pashitra is Mitra's city of warmth, a city of bright white buildings, each of which has a central stove that radiates warmth. Pashitra contains a well-traveled gate to Bytopia, the home of Savitri. The gate is a set of two golden pillars engraved with signs, seals, and prophecies. Mitra's Temple of the Golden Bull towers above all buildings in the center of town, made of warm marble and festooned with silk banners. Its ruler is the paladin Benazir Singh.
