Diancastra is a chaotic good demigoddess (or hero-goddess) of impudence, pleasure, trickery, and wit. Her father is Annam, and her mother was a mortal giant, probably a storm or cloud giant. She is the protagonist of many tales of trickery and adventure - she has stolen from Blibdoolpoolp, won a drinking contest in the Seelie+Court, matched wits with the lich Lyzandred, and been the lover of Deep Sashelas (which left her with a permanent scar). Annam made her divine in exchange for making him laugh.
