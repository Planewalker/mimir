True Death is the basic belief that is the root of the Dustmen's philosophy. Chapter 3 of the forthcoming PSCS defines it as such:
"The only goal now is to achieve True Death and pass beyond this miserable stage of existence. What comes after True Death? Well, thatâ€™s up for debate. Some believe that after True Death, a body comes back into True Life, and has a chance to live again where he lived before, a place far more vibrant and real than this pale post-mortal shadow. Others believe that it's not True Life that comes after True Death, but a true afterlife, where joy and real happiness are the only things there are, and pain is unknown. Still others believe that True Death is oblivion; that what it brings is a permanent end to the soul and to consciousness. What all the Dustmen agree on, however, is that whatever comes after True Death, it has to be better than this."
