Chaggrins, or soil beasts, are a kind of Grue native to the Elemental Plane of Earth. They may appear as yellowish hedghogs with skull-like heads, as large moles, or as a disgusting, manlike, bipedal shape made of lumpy, wet, clay with malformed, vicious face. Their tiny eyes gleam with malice. 
Chaggrins are sometimems enslaved by Dao or crysmals as diggers or watchdogs. Most other races consider them too hateful to be of use. Outcast chaggrins can be encountered on the Prime Material Plane, where they may serve derro or duergar. Gnomish worshippers of Urdlen consider them sacred.
On their home plane, chaggrins are vermin, exterminated by most elemental beings because they devour precious gems. Some earth+elementals consider them to be delicious, however. 
When killed, it leaves behind a Spell object that contains a single spell suitable for copying into a spellbook.A chaggrin can be summoned with a summon monster IV spell.
