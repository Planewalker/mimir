The Great Bazaar, sometimes called the Grand Bazaar, is the largestÂ market in Sigil. 
A basher can't help but notice the oddities that is the Great Bazaar: a city of tent stalls and shops, where common, rare, and magical wares are sold daily on the street. Inhabitants from a thousand worlds converse in alien languages and attempt to catch the attention of tourist and shoppers alike. Performers dance on the street corners, musicians play music with strange instruments, theologians preach their philosophies to those willing to listen, and magicians perform acts of prestidigitation.
