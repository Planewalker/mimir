Goldenmane's a Bariaur who appears to have some leoine blood. Perhaps one of his ancestors mated with a Leonal. He's more polite and refined than most of his kind, but he's not afraid to tell a Deva to his face that the Celestial's had too much to drink.
Goldenmane belongs to the Believers of the Source Faction (or at least he did before the Faction War. He's the doorkeeper at the Golden Bariaur Inn, which is named after him.
