Humans can be found nearly anywhere in the Multiverse. Most are born and raised on the planes, employed as merchants, adventurers, or any other profession known on the planes. Humans may not be as powerful as many planar races, but they are highly adaptable, allowing them to live in places some planetouched cannot. Much of the conflict between ideologies occurs among humans, especially in Sigil and among the factions. Human settlements usually reflect the architecture of the realm or plane where they live, resembling traditional homes but influenced by whatever races they coexist with. Still, many humans have no ties to any specific realm or land, and can be found wandering and exploring the multiverse. No matter where you go on the planes, humans likely have been there first.
