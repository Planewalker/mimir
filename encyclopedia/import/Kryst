The kryst are intelligent beings made of crystalline rock. They are native to the Elemental Plane of Earth.
A kryst looks like a group of twelve golden crystal spikes, all projecting outward from a central point. The kryst communicate by telepathy or written messages. 
The kryst have a widespread and complex society in their own realms, peacefully living with and helping the earth+elementals. They welcome visitors, and are eager to gain new knowledge of all types. They fear and wage a never-ending war against the hordes, and seek to unite other creatures against them. The kryst are also enemies of the Hydrax, though they rarely encounter them.
