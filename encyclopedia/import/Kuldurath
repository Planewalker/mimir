Kulduraths are hulking quadrupeds native to the Outlands. They're common mounts for Ferrumach Rilmani. They look similar to tusked, hornless rhinos, but their limbs're built like those of rabbits. Their bodies are covered with iron-gray scales. They can emit electric bursts, to which rilmani are immune. They average 14 feet in length and can weigh 7500 pounds.
