D'hin'ni are Planetouched descended from the union of a Djinni and a lightfoot Halfling. They are impulsive and flighty creatures resembling tall halflings with dusky skin. Adult males are bald and females wear their hair long. They favor the study of magic, and speak the languages of halflings and djinn. Most revere Brandobaris or Shaundakul. They are typically chaotic neutral in alignment.
