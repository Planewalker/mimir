Surtr (also called Surtur) is both the lord and Power of the fire giants of Ysgard. He can control any fire on the Prime Material Plane. Surtr resembles an immense fire giant, with crackling flames for hair and eyebrows.
Like most giants, Surtr hates the Norse+Gods of Asgard and is anxiously awaiting Ragnarok. He will lend his aid to any plan that troubles those deities. 
He rules the realm of Muspelheim in the second Layer of Ysgard.
