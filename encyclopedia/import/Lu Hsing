As the Chinese Power of salaries and functionaries, Lu Hsing is often revered by ambitious bureaucrats. He served the founder of the Han dynasty as a loyal and honest administrator. As a result, Shang-ti deified him and gave to him the task of overseeing the fair distribution of rewards in the earthly bureaucracy. Along with Fu Hsing and Shou Hsing, he is one of the three gods worshipped by public servants in order to assure a prosperous career and a happy life. In his true form, he is an immaculately groomed man with a pleasant countenance and a long, silky beard.
Lu Hsing’s primary concern is ensuring that hardworking bureaucrats receive the rewards they deserve. He is more concerned with results than with methods, so dishonesty or treachery does not hinder an administrator’s career, so long as it is employed for the benefit of the state.
However, he detests corruption in any form, so any official committing dishonorable acts for personal gain stands a small chance of coming to Lu Hsing’s notice. In such cases, Lu Hsing tries to correct the aberrant behavior through a series of omens. First, the individual’s salary is somehow lost for three weeks in a row. Second, his superior makes a surprise inspection and, no matter what he finds, chastises the bureaucrat for keeping a sloppy office. Third, the bureaucrat receives a visit and stern lecture from Lu Hsing’s avatar. If the individual still does not redress his misdoings, Lu Hsing arranges public exposure of the official’s corruption. 
His Realm, The Ministry of Rewards, is located in Arcadia on the Layer of Abellio.
