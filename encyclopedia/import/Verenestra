Verenestra is the patron goddess of dryads, nymphs, and sylphs. She is fickle and vain, dwelling in the Seelie+Court in a bower of silver birches, larches, willows, and plane trees decorated with silver filigree, mirrors, and jewels. She is jealous and avoids contact with other goddesses of beauty, love, and romance.
