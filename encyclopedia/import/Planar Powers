Some powers are limited to a particular sphere on the Prime Material Plane. These're called single-sphere powers.[/b] Other powers are popular within multiple crystal+spheres - these are the multi-sphere powers. [/b]Still others are popular among planewalkers, too. These, I guess, would be the planar powers.[/b]
Examples of planar powers include the now-dead Aoskar, Celestian, Shaundakul, and Keoghtom, all gods of planar travel.
Other planar powers are popular among the factions: St. Cuthbert is popular among the Harmonium, Siva is popular among the Doomguard, and Trithereon is popular among the Free League.
