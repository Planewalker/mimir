Tabi (singular: tabur) are a race of Lomendur from the plane of Mechanus. They often serve lawful neutral spellcasters as familiars. 
In their true forms, a tabur looks like a white marble statue exactly two and a quarter feet in height. It has perfect, symmetrical proportions, resembling an idealized version of the race of its master. When open, their eyes look like silvery pools.Â  Tabi can polymorph themselves into hawks, badgers, dogs, or hares.
