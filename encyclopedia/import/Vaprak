Vaprak the Destroyer is a lesser god of uncertain origins. He is worshipped by ogres, trolls, and some hill giants, and it seems probable that he may be the offspring of a god of the Giant Pantheon. One legend says that a hideous, vastly tall ogress disguised herself in order to seduce Annam, and Vaprak was the result.
Another myth said that the first of the mortal race of ogres was the result of an affair between Vaprak and Othea, Annam's wife.
Vaprak himself has three sons: Anori (or Agmori), Hakuni, and Muaj, who are believed to have sired the three races of ogre magi.
Vaprak is said to resemble a huge, hideous ogre/troll crossbreed. His Realm on the 524th layer of the+Abyss is called Shatterstone. There, he dwells in a pitiful cave at the base of a great cliff.
