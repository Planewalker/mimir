Ruvokas are tall, gaunt, tribal humanoids native to nearly all of the Inner Planes, even extremely hostile ones like the Quasielemental Plane of Lightning and the Quasielemental Plane of Vacuum. They are druids as well as warriors.
According to myth, they were originally humans from Athas gifted with immortality and the ability to dwell in the Inner Planes by an Efreeti lord.
