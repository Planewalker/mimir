Pechs are good and peaceful creatures from the Elemental Plane of Earth. They are small - about the height of gnomes - and thin, with long arms and legs, broad hands and feet. They have pale, yellowish skin and red or reddish brown hair. Their flesh is like granite; their eyes are large, white orbs with no pupils or irises.
Pechs work as miners and stoneworkers; they have the power to shape earthwith their wills alone, although they supplement this power with picks and peat hammers.
Pechs are often enslaved by the Dao, so they often travel to the Prime Material Plane in search of better lives. On their home plane, they ally with Sandmen and earth+weirds. Recently, a mighty pech queen sought to unite the various tribes, but it turned out she was just a puppet of Ogremoch.
