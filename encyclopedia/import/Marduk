Marduk the Valiant, called the Justice Bringer and Lord of Pure Incantations, is the Babylonian Power of cities, wind, thunder, storms, and rain and the dedicted foe of Tiamat. His eponymous city-Realm, made of marble and adobe, is found in Abellio in the Plane of Arcadia. The rivers Luar and Kath flow through his realm, keeping it cool even on the hottest days. His Einheriar, the kindari, are often sent to aid other powers of his mythos. Dragons or dragon-kin are not permitted in the city of Marduk, though others are allowed as long as they do not disobey the law.
He is always shown with four eyes, four ears, flames shooting from his mouth when he speaks, and a reddish tinge to his skin. He is a greater power, and occasionally assumes leadership of the Babylonian Pantheon when Anu is preoccupied.
