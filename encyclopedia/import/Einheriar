Einheriar (en-HARE-ee-ahr; meaning "army of one") are Humanoid spirits employed by the powers of the Upper Planes as servants, warriors, patrols, or guards. They appear as wispy humanoids carrying equally wispy weapons and armor. They respect the Aasimon and other celestials, but operate independently of those greater beings, receiving their guidance through prayer.
In norse mythology, Einherjaar are the brave souls that die on the battlefields and whose spirits are gathered up by the Valkyries that bring them to Valhalla.
