Daghdha, or more appropriately the Daghdha, enjoys a position of leadership among the loose confederation of Celtic powers, a god of druids. His powers widely varied, but he is credited with control over the weather and crops. His great cauldron is a bottomless receptacle with food and drink and the abundance of the Celtic other-world from which he comes â€” there is virtually nothing he cannot pull from his cauldron. Daghdha is the custodian the gods and all Celtic people, using his charms and powers to protect and aid them whenever he can. As a warrior he is a great leader and scout, as a father figure he is both stern and fun-loving; Daghdha enjoys being a comical figure of great power.
Daghdha is a happy go lucky sort who is only interested in the general welfare of his Celtic worshippers. He will often send his avatar to appear at the scene of an impending battle and use his charms to sway crucial male figures on the other side. He also sends him during times of pestilence or crop failure to set things right. He will resort to comic trickery to get his own way.
He resides in Tir na Og in the Outlands. His personal holding there is called Mag Mell, the Fields of Happiness. At the center is the Grove of the Daghdha, where the god's mystical cauldron lies.
