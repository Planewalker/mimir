The sly and seductive lilitus are masters at mocking the divine. They infiltrate temples, corrupt priests and slowly convert their victims to the worship of Abyssal lords. They are born from the ashes of succubi in a profane ritual.
Lilitus resemble beautiful women with sharp talons, vacant white eyes, and cloven feet. Burnt and broken fragments of wings protrude from their backs, along with four writhing tails.
Many serve Malcanthet or Graz'zt. They get along with most other demons, particularly Glabrezu.
