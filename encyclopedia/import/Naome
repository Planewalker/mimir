Naome, the consort of Belial, is highly regarded for her ability to settle disputes and
her shrewd bargaining ability. In battle she wields a scimitar. Naome
is a short, burly, middle-aged female devil with long brown hair and
cold, pale blue-green eyes. She has a tinkling laugh and a surprisingly
light, easy sense of humor. She rarely makes enemies, though she bears
no love for Glasya or Lilith; she's most friendly with Baftis. She
prefers green or claret-colored silken robes. Only her tiny horns, gray
hooves, and crimson forked tail betray her diabolic nature. Her face,
shoulders, and hands are human in complexion, but the rest of her body
is deep crimson in color. Her hands have long red nails. She is six
feet tall.
Faces of Evil: The Fiends says she is of indeterminate gender. Fiendish Codex II: Tyrants of the Nine Hells tells us she is now dead.
