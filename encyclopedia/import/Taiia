Taiia, known also as the Watcher, the Maker, the Devourer, the Dancer, and the Blinding Light, is the sole goddess in a monotheistic faith based on the worship of the sun. In Taiia, all opposites are resolved. She is creator and destroyer, death and life. Seemingly fickle and whimsical, she gives and takes without regard to good or evil. Her faith includes priests of all alignments, though she herself is neutral.
The faithful of Taiia deny the reality of gods other than Taiia. Her symbol is a three-eyed solar disk. The goddess herself manifests as a humanoid being with four arms, three eyes, red skin and golden hair. She shines with a glow like that of the sun.
