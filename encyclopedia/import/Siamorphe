 Siamorphe (sigh-a-morf) is a Faerunian demigoddess of nobility (Human nobility, precisely). She is Lawful Neutral, has the Knowledge, Law, Nobility, and Planning domains, and has a light mace as her favored weapon.
 Siamorphe's clergy are primarily connected to the nobility of Waterdeep and Tethyr, and are generally advisers and councilors. They generally preside over advisory councils and royal ceremonies, and often help determine heirs to fortunes or thrones. Others take to heart their deity's message of guiding the masses, and also serve as leaders for the leaderless, serving commoners, and arbitrating disputes. They pray for spells at noon.
 Siamorphe is the current deity of royalty, the most recent in a long line of similar gods. Thus, she has few allies and enemies, but dislikes gods of corruption (Bane, Cyric, Tiamat, etc.).
