The Hall of Records is the hub of Sigil's bureaucracy, located on Rook Street in the Clerk's Ward. Secreted within is personal information and secret history of just about everything and everyone. 
Many centuries ago, the Hall of Records was known as Bigby's College of Academic Arts. Citing overdue taxes, the Fated evicted Bigby (a famous mage from Oerth) and made the campus into their new headquarters.
After the Faction War, the Fated left Sigil for Ysgard. The Hall is presently under the control of the Sigil Advisory Council.
