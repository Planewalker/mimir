Anthill [/b]is a Cant term meaning city or town. Sigil's an anthill; so's Plague-Mort and the City of Brass. So's Waterdeep and the City of Greyhawk, if you care about Prime+Material cities. Mandible in Arcadia is an anthill in the cant sense and it's also a literal anthill, since it's full of Formians.
