Carcosa is a city in the Lovecraft mythos, created by Ambrose Bierce and expanded on by Robert W. Chambers and (much later) by John Tynes for the Call of Cthulhu game and a short film. Carcosa is a city on the shores of a misty lake - both are of uncertain, constantly shifting dimensions, sometimes transposing with parts of the Material+Plane. It is the home of the mysterious King of Yellow, an aspect of Hastur.
Dungeon Magazine #134 explicitly made it part of the Far Realm.
