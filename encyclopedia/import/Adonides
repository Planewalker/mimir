Adonides is a baatezu+noble who serves Mephistopheles as the steward of Cania, responsible for the security and internal stability of the realm. His experiences thus far have made him mistrust all pit+fiends, and to suspect every Gelugon and Cornugon of being a spy for Baalzebul. Adonides is naturally cruel and high-handed, and — since Barbas is chamberlain of Mephistar, and the steward has no authority there — the steward of Cania spends much of his time roaming the plane with a guard of gelugons, searching for and punishing intruders or law-breakers.
Adonides appears as a young, long-haired, darkly handsome man of giant stature. He has unusual glittering black eyes and a fanged grin. The hair hides two small horns; Adonides wears robes to hide his short forked tail and scarlet torso.
