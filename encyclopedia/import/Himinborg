Himinborg, also called Himinbjorg, is a circular city on the Ysgard end of the rainbow bridge Bifrost, home of the guardian Power Heimdall. It lies in the center of the Plain of Ida, outside the gates of Asgard. It's a gate-town of sorts, as everyone must pass through Himinborg on the way to and from the Material+Plane, if they have business in Asgard.
Himinborg's walls are manned by Einheriar, and outside the gates the Doksmid dwarves sell metalwork to travellers. Nearby is the Celestial stronghold Vundvellir.
