Delphons, or songsharks, are fishy natives of the River Oceanus. They look like mundane sharks with brilliant coloration, often with complex and beautiful tattoos. They are intelligent, and in their songs can be found great secrets relating to the planes and the Multiverse in general. 
Delphons are carnivores, charming fish with their song. Using the secrets they know, they can planeshift at will to any plane the Oceanus touches.
