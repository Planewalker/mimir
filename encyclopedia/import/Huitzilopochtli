Huitzilopochtli is the Aztec god of lightning and war. He is usually depicted as a warrior with armor carved from blue jade. His axe is bright red, his javelin is blue, and his headdress is made of hummingbird feathers. 
The hearts of captured enemies are sacrificed to him at the tops of tall pyramids. His Realm is in the World Above, which some claim is a parallel Material+Plane.
