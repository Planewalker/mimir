As the Power of science, knowledge, and medicine, Thoth is an important figure in the Egyptian Pantheon. he is not related to any of the other gods in the Egyptian pantheon, a fact that makes him something of an outcast. On the other hand, there are those who believe that it was he, not Ra, who was the source of all creation. Thoth is very close to Isis, Osiris, and Horus.
It is said that Thoth maintains a set of three great books in which all knowledge is recorded. These books are locked away at the heart of a great crypt possibly located in his Realm, Thoth's Estate, in the Outlands.
Thoth is not generous with his knowledge, but neither is he covetous of it. For those who work long and hard at research and science, he is a faithful source of information. Thoth is truly omniscient.
He appears as an ibis-headed man.Â
