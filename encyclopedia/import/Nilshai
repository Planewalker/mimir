Belonging to the same Ethereal ecology as ethereal+filchers, ethereal+slayers, and ethereal+marauders, the nilshai - or ethereal theurges - are alien spellcasters who raid the Prime Material Plane in search of slaves and arcane lore. They dwell in the Deep Ethereal in maddeningly complex cities of solid ether. They worship Mak Thuum Ngatha, the Nine-Tongued Worm.
