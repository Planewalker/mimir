A monodrone looks like a small sphere with a single eye. It has four spiderlike limbs (two arms and two legs).
Monodrones are barely intelligent modrons that make up most of the population of Regulus. They are unable to speak or read, but they can understand commands spoken in the modron tongue. They accept orders only from duodrones and exist only for their work.
