The mysterious stone of the Acropolis of the Titans on Mount Othrys in Carceri is jet-black with silver marbling, resembling a starry sky with gemlike points of light. The ”gems” melt away in one to four days if cut loose. There’s one main vein and several smaller channels of stone, something like the outlines of a body.
In truth, the "marble" is the sleeping body of the ancient Power Uranus.
