Freya is the Norse Power of love, unbridled passion, and fertility, brother of Frey, daughter of Njord and Nerthus, and wife of Odur. Like her twin brother Frey, she is one of the Vanir sent to guarantee peace with the Aesir after the war begun with the torture of Gullveig. In the sense that passion is a hot, consuming emotion, she is also associated with fire, and perhaps this is why she is widely respected by the efreet, who call her Freyal. 
She is the patroness of a type of magic called “seithr,” in which the sorceress enters a trance in order to answer questions about the future. As the goddess of fertility, Freya also looks after women in labor. She has the power to kindle passion in any being, to control fires anywhere on the Prime+Material, to see the future, to bless any woman with a child, and to alleviate pain and injury. Freya also has a beautiful fur-lined cloak that allows her to turn into a falcon. In her true form, Freya is a voluptuous woman of entrancing beauty.
Freya is a rather vain goddess who enjoys flattery - though she is far from foolish enough to believe it. She is not above using her looks to acquire what she wants, such as her priceless necklace, Brisingamen.
She resides in Vanaheim.
