Battleloths are living tools for their Yugoloth masters to exploit. Each takes the form of a particular weapon. They are wily and cunning creatures whose allegiance can be bought by the highest bidder at any time.
Because a legion of battleloths betrayed the Pit Fiend general Balruhk in a very public way (committing the unforgiveable sin of getting caught), the yugoloths barred them from being summoned for three centuries. These centuries are now up.
The six known types of battleloths are arrow, axe, crossbow, pick, spiked chain, and sword.
