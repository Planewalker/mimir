Rrakkma means "vengeance" in the Githzerai tongue. The hard-hearted githzerai go on rrakkma to slay illithids in punishment for the mind flayers' enslavement of their people eons before. Rrakkma refers only to illithid hunts, not raids against the Githyanki, which are Gith-attala.
Though they certainly kill illithids with the same zeal that githzerai show, githyanki don't seem to use the word at all, so perhaps it is a metaphor referring to the actions of a particular githzerai hero. I'm speculating here.
