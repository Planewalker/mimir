The Mind’s Eye came into existence shortly after the Faction War, a new Faction made up of former members of both the Believers of the Source and the Sign of One. Those who gather under the name of the Seekers follow a mixture of their parent factions’ tenets, choosing to travel the planes in search of challenges, which they believe is the path to a new level of existence. Somewhat self-centered, and every last one filled with an over-inflated sense of self-esteem, the Seekers view the Multiverse as their personal playground. This arrogant attitude has unfortunately resulted in a lack of popularity with the average planar, though despite first appearances they are far from the callously detached egomaniacs that some berks would have you believe them to be.
