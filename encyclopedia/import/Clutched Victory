Clutched Victory is, or was, a baatezu fortress in the Gray Waste, installed to defend territory won in the Blood War. It resembles a tall tower with a huge globe at the top, made to look like a scaly, diabolic arm grasping a silver sphere. There are no doors and windows - fiends must teleport to get in and out.
'Course, Tanar'ri can teleport in and out, too, but the fortress if filled with thousands of tiny rooms without room for more than a couple of fiends in each, each guarded by baatezu who attack invaders while they get their bearings.
