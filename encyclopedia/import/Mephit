Mephits are small, mischievous creatures looking much like imps and quasits made of various Elemental, Paraelemental, and Quasielemental substances. They are often created by Fiends as living messages, and they are found throughout the Inner Planes. 
Each mephit subrace has a distinct personality, but they all tend to be somewhat arrogant and annoying.
