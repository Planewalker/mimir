Nai No Kami is the Japanese god of earthquakes. His true form is that of a gigantic, powerfully built man. As a lawful neutral deity, he lives in Mechanus, in a Realm called the Shaking Land. He insists that his temples be kept spotlessly clean and that all insults to his name be avenged, and is not above punishing slackers with earth-shaking disasters.
