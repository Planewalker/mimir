The Vale of the Spine lies in the Outlands around the Gate-town of Ribcage. It is so named for the high thin tors that rise up and curl inwards towards the Burg. There are two schools of thought as to what the vale is. One is more 'scientific' and suggests that the vale is a series of geological tors affected by the corrupting influence of Baator that flows from Ribcage. The other suggests that the tors are in fact the ribs of a long dead Power, a power that may be coming back to life as the tors seem to be growing larger.
