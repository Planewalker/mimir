Dhours are an aberrant race of dimensional hunters that hunt the Astral Plane and Ethereal Plane. Their bodies are made of amorphous protoplasm, with organs that pulse with light and three-robed brains. They attatch themselves to conduits, vortices, color+pools, and other intrusions into the Astral or Ethereal Planes (like bags+of+holding?), waiting to waylay planewalkers.
Dhours are new to the planes, having come from some unknown, alien realm far from the known universes.
Inspirations
The description of the dhour is very similar to that of the ihagnim from Dragon #89, an amoeba-like race of Astral predators. Both even have nucleuses containing a brain. Ihagnim are explicitly identified as the predators responsible for the bags of holding. The ihagnim was created by Roger E. Moore.
