A greater power holding the titles "Goddess of the Sun" and "Lady of Reason," Avani is a goddess of the Cerilian Pantheon, worshipped chiefly by the Khinasi people. She inherited the portfolio - which includes the sun, reason, and magic - of the dead goddess Basa√Øa. She is married to Erik; their child is Laerme.
Her Realm in Mechanus is known as the Gleaming Spire. It resembles a great city built in Khinasi (Arabic) style, with libraries, bathhouses, and plazas; her palace, the realm's centerpiece, is made of clear, crystal flame. It is a land of warmth and peace where nothing is out of place, and where action is impossible unless preceded by logic and forethought. Ciphers and the like who try to act without thinking cannot even enter it.
