The Book of Inverted Darkness is a book of ancient legends of the Lower Planes, some of which predate the Blood War. It is a focus of evil power, the very core of corruption.
A man called Eslathagos Malkith was corrupted by this book, becoming convinced that light was darkness and darkness light; hate, misery, and contempt became the sole objects of his lust.
Vecna found a ritual within this book which he hoped would allow him to escape from the Demiplane+of+Dread.
A book of excerpts from this tome, called Pihnmid's Translation, can be found in the Great Library in Sigil. The original tome can currently be found on the Prime Material Plane, on the top of a tall spire in a fortress known as Jabel Shammar.
Kesto Brighteyes used an alleged translation of this book to summon the Gautiere Saure.
