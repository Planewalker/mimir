Marchosias was such a legendary murderer that when his soul finally descended into Baator, the souls of other murderers all massed together to kill him. The Baatezu let them fight it out, intending to punish them all for such lawlessness when it was all over. Yet the Petitioners who attacked Marchosias were so enraged, so determined, that when it was over there was nothing left of Marchosias' soul at all. He became a Vestige.
