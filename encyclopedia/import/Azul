Azul (also known as Calor) is the Giver of Rain and the Taker of Breath in the pantheon of Maztica. He, in various aspects, represents rain, moisture, rivers, lakes, streams, snow, alcohol, drunkenness, ice, fish, and frogs.
He is pictured as a plump, smiling child, because children are his favorite sacrifice. His clerics keep themselves scrupulously clean.
Azul created the Realm of Tlalocan in Abellio, the first layer of Arcadia. It is a paradise for those killed by water, created in order to please Azul's wife. Azul himself, however, dwells primarily in Exbal Ken, a realm in Chamada, the second Layer of Gehenna. Exbal Ken was named for the anti-hero who invented human sacrifice.
Azul is lawful evil, although like all Maztican deities he is an ambiguous figure with good, necessary elements to his character as well as evil ones. He is very much like the Aztec god Tlaloc.
