Sharlocke is an advanced Arcanaloth (sorcerer 2 / archmage 4). He acts as an agent in the adventure Diplomacy
on behalf of the Yugoloth heirarchy, or at least his own interests and
those of his immediate superior in Sigil, Shemeshka the Marauder, who herself
acts in this particular case on behalf of an unnamed figure much higher
in the 'loth heirarchy (Helekanalaith in Gehenna, or Mydianchlarus in
the Gray Waste are suggested).
