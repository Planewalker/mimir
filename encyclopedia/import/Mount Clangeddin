Mount Clangeddin is the Realm of Clangeddin Silverbeard, the dwarven Power of battle. The mountain is located in the first Layer of Arcadia, Abellio. It is a perfectly conical mountain, standing apart from any range, rises at least thirty thousand feet above the fields below, its peak wreathed in clouds and storms. This edifice was raised by Clangeddin himself. The mountain's interiors are riddled with great halls, galleries, and dwarven-carved roads paved with flagstones. Costly lamps, hot and cold forges, and city-wide feasting halls all provide light and merriment for the mountain's visitors. Strangers are welcome here, especially those who come to order special weapons from the legendary smiths who labor in the hottest portions of the forge. The dwarves who live within Mount Clangeddin, both mortal and Petitioner, spend half of each day drilling, training, and perfecting their military skills to honor their lord Clangeddin. Visitors seeking to raise an army sometimes come to Mount Clangeddin, tempting the deity with stories of righteous warfare. Sometimes, Clangeddin is moved by such appeals and assigns axes to the cause.
