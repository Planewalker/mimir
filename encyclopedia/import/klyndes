Natives of the Quasielemental+Plane+of+Steam, klyndes are creatures of wispy darkness, existing only in between the water and the air that make up the vaporous atmosphere of their home. They're intelligent, but they don't interact with others of their kind in any way; they don't even believe others of their kind exist, and have no names for themselves or their species. Their voices are the hissing of steam.
"There is only one darkness, one light, so only one shadow." 
They are the only known predators on their plane, primarily feeding on Fabere. Some have been known to hire out as assassins or spies, but they cannot abide atmospheres without humidity.
