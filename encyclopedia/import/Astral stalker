Muscular humanoids with black-green skin, wickedly sharp claws, and skull-like, demonic visages, Astral stalkers roam the Multiverse looking for the ultimate quarry. They live for the thrill of the hunt, and measure their personal status by the number and power of the creatures they've killed.
Astral stalkers have a simple code of honor called the Rules of the Hunt, saying they can't hunt creatures who have successfully eluded them in the past, they can't hunt their employers for at least a year after their employment has terminated, and they can't hunt one another.
