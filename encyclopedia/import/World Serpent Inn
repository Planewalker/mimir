The World Serpent Inn is both a place and a nonplace, existing in multiple planes simultaneously and nowhere at all. It is a gathering place for dead races, unborn powers, forgotten heroes, restless ghosts, and the engineers of worlds as yet uncreated. Almost all the inhabitants of the Inn are travelers, either by design or by chance. Many have simply stopped here during journeys to other places, while others came to the Inn accidentally, then realized they could not get home.
The only permanent resident of the World Serpent Inn seems to be Mitchifer, a jolly human of indeterminate age with a rosy complexion and long white beard. He acts as the barkeep, serving drinks and making chitchat in the common room.
The World Serpent Inn exists on multiple worlds.  On Toril, it can be found at the Wild Goose in Arabel.  According to Elminster, it was built by three wizards so that planar travelers could avoid the "violence-loving idiots of Sigil."
