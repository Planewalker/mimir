Jergal is a lawful neutral demipower known to the people of Toril, presiding over fatalism and protection of the dead. He acts as an advisor to the Faerunian god of death, currently Kelemvor.
In times past, he was a greater deity presiding also over death, dusk, undeath, and tyranny. He tired of this role, which had ceased to be challenging or meaningful for him, so he played a game of knucklebones with the newly ascended godlings Bane, Myrkul, and Bhaal, dividing the bulk of his responsibilities among them.
Jergal resembles a dessicated mantis. He dwells in the Crystal Spire in Oinos with Kelemvor.
He is a practically ideal deity for the Dustmen.
