Known as Mulungu in East Africa, the Supreme Being is also known as Leza in Central Africa, and Nyambe in West and Southern Africa.
Mulungu lives in the upper planes, and is benevolent towards Mankind. He knows all, sees all, and can do anything. He is Supreme Justice, and the Creator of all things. He is the “incomprehensible being,” responsible for good and evil, suffering and happiness.
