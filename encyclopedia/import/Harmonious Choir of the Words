These celestials are small balls of light with alien runes coming from their vague mouths and circling around their bodies. Their voices sound like dozens of beings speaking in unison. They have powers over music, and know the words of creation. They are, in fact, made out of those words; they dwell in libraries and public courtyards in the Outlands and in the realms of Deneir, Milil, Oghma, and Gond.
