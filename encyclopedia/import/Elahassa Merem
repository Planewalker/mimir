Elahassa Merem of the Order of Master Clerks and Scribes (LN female human Exp12 Fraternity of Order) - 
Councilwoman Merem has been a relatively quite and benign presence upon the Sigil Advisory Council for most of her term, swaying towards the positions of Chairwoman Rhys as well as those of Councilwoman Cirily at times. Though she has been relatively fickle in her votes on the council, most think she is assured of reelection, mostly because the other members on the council feel that she is not tied down ideologically to any one of the other members. However, she has, on a number of occasions, quarreled with Councilman Hatchis, more for his views on the Clerkâ€™s+Ward, which in a way she exemplifies, than for his voting record.
