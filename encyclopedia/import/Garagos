Garagos the Reaver is a lesser Faerûnian Power of war, though he focuses more on destruction than war itself.  He is chaotic neutral.
His Realm in Cocytus, the second Layer of Pandemonium, is called Battle Guarde. Battle Guarde is proudly proclaimed as whatever region of the plane Garagos happens to be in.
