Verden is a wood elf who works the Azure Iris inn in the Lady's Ward, right on top of the infamous Fortune's Wheel. While she's kind enough, Verden is secretly a Prolonger, a being who extends their own life by draining others. She's always looking for new threats to her longetivity, painfully aware of her former mortality. Supposedly, she had a deal cut with a Dustman who now has the rights to her corpse, and when she was magically aged in an accident, she began frantically searching for ways to extend her life (The City Courts have ben trying to get a ruling on the deal, and the Dustmen have even tried to get her killed, via the agency of Qaida).
Verden is often seen among the gamblers and drinkers in the gambling hall below the Azure Iris, looking for people to suck the life out of, and listening for leads on life-extending magic. However, she has a tendency to be easily distracted, and some times, she just can't stay still.
