Acaste
[/b]Acaste is the ghoul-queen of the Dead+Nation, a slavering
flesh-eater who holds her pack together with fear of the Silent King
and sheer bullying. She is tough, strong, and despite her appearance,
clever. She is one to watch, to be sure.

[/b]
                   She tells you that she is the leader of the
                pack of ghouls and that she can't wait to kill everyone. One of
                the pack is a knifed ghoul. He has the knife of Uhir, you can
                get it by exchanging some money.</p>
