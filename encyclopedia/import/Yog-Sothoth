The greater god Yog-Sothoth, known also as the Key and the Guardian of the Gate, has the ability to enter the universe at any point in space and any point in time.  On his own plane, his shape appears as a congress of iridescent globes like giant soap bubbles.  When he takes shape on the Prime Material Plane he is partly material and partly astral and appears as a gigantic mass of feelers, legs, and stalked organs.  He is highly intelligent and extremely chaotic and unpredictable.
Yog-Sothoth is not subject to the laws of space and time, and can, for example, appear at various parts of the universe simultaneously.
