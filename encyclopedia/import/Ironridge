Ironridge is a mostly human community in the Outlands, found in the midst of the mountains that seperate Xaos and Glorium, very near the Dwarven Mountain, the realm of Gzemnid and Ilsensine's Caverns of Thought.
Ironridge moves about a bit, as most Outlandish sites do, and it can be found anywhere from the fifth to the eighth of the Outlands' rings.
