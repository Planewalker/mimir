Maztica is the goddess from which the Maztica setting gets its name. She is called the Mother of Life, and also simply the World.
And now she is dead, yet she lives on in the form of all life on the planet.
Maztica was murdered by Zaltec, her son. She was once pictured as a plump human woman with a smiling face. When she died, her essence merged with the world of Toril itself, although a gigantic stony husk now drifts in the Astral Plane, the last remnant of what made her an individual. She was married to Kukul, another dead god.
