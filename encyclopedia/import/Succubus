Succubi (singular: succubus) are Tanar'ri of lust and temptation. While their counterparts, the Erinyes, try to convince their victims to oppose Chaos in favor of the delicious agonies of Law, succubi teach their prey to embrace Chaos and depravity.
Succubi are the females of the species. Males are known as incubi.
