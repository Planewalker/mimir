Buseni (singular: busen) are shapeshifting creatures native to Arcadia. They have ebony skin that gleams like oil.Â  They have no visible features, neither eyes, noses, ears, nor mouths. 
They can take humanoid or quadruped form, or melt down into puddles. They can form weapons from their bodies, neither bone nor metal. 
Buseni guard Buxenus, the second Layer of Arcadia, from intruders, protecting the caves and mountain passes that function as Portals from Abellio.
Who or what created the buseni is an open question. Some credit Meriadar, while others say they are spawned by the plane itself.
