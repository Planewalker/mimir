The Illuminated are a Sect based in Plague-Mort, the Gate-town to the Abyss. Led by their Sectol, a male human wizard by the name of Green Marvent, their beliefs generally revolve around the idea that members of the sect are 'illuminated', holding some spark of gnosis or divinity that sets them above all others, and that ultimately they are intended to hold sway over the multiverse by virtue of their innate superiority. Generally the group tries to influence others by guile rather than brute force, using trickery and subversion to gain what they need.
There are obvious parallels with the Believers of the Source, the Takers, and possibly the Mind's Eye.
The sect featured as the primary antagonist in the module 'The Eternal Boundary'.
