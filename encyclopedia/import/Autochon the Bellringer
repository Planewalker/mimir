Autochon the Bellringer is also called the Minister of Messages. He runs a professional courier service in Sigil; his couriers are ensorcelled with magic mouth spells to ensure that the couriers themselves don't need to know the messages, that messages are always exactly as a client desires them, and that there is no inconvenient paper trail.
Autochon also desires silent messengers because he is afflicted with a curse forcing him to constantly hear the terrible clanging of bells; no one else can hear them, but they affect Autochon terribly. His dweomered armor - which he is never seen without - dampens this noise enough to let Autochon maintain his sanity, but barely. 
His armor was provided by Shemeshka the Marauder, and consequently Autochon is forever in the Fiend's debt.
Autochon also silences potential competitors to his service - brutally. However, he has mysteriously chosen to allow Kylie the Tout to remain unharmed and still in business.
