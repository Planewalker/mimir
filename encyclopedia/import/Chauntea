Chauntea is a greater Power of Faerun. She is loving deity, advising the denizens of the world of Toril on how to maintain nature, to ensure its conservation. It is contended that her hand guided those of mortality to give up the sceptical nature of the gather for the maintenance of the fields.
Her full portfolio is agriculture, elements, farmers, forests, gardeners, plants cultivated by humans, summer, the sea and sea creatures, wild animals, and wild nature. She is neutral good.
She dwells on Eronia, the second Layer of Elysium, in a Realm called the Great Mother's Garden, which she shares with Djaea and Liu. The name of the realm is somewhat misleading, as it is not cultivated; plants grow there as they do in nature, with thousands of different plants in vast fields.
