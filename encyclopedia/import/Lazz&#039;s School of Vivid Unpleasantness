Lazz is the owner of Lazz's School of Vivid Unpleasantness in Sigil. The name is an in-joke. Game designer Carl Sargent (who wrote Monster Mythology, Night Below, a host of Greyhawk and a few Mystara books) referred to cartographer Rob Lazzareti's poster maps in the Planescape+campaign+setting as "They look like the
drawings of a 10 year old and the colouring could be described as coming from
the art school of Vivid Unpleasantness" in an otherwise positive review. The designers of In the Cage: A Guide to Sigil embraced the criticism and honored it with a building in the city itself.
