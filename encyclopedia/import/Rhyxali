Rhyxali, a sister of Graz'zt, holds sway over the shadow+demons and the secrets and souls they procure as they skulk about the Lower+Planes].+Her+[[realm is on the 49th Layer of the Abyss, Shaddonon, although she regularly travels to Azzagrat, accompanied by 99 shadow demons (including Kadasha, her favorite) to trade secrets with her brother.
In the past, Rhyxali attempted to corrupt the Plane+of+Mirrors and pull it into her layer of the Abyss; though she has not succeeded, she has many mirror Mephit minions and knows things about the plane that others do not.
