The forces of nature, both subtle and grand, are manifestations of a deeper reality, where cosmic spheres revolve about each other in an awesome celestial dance. That dance generates the energy behind the fury of a storm, the brilliant sun, and even the vitality of life. The druid who understands the ecological connections between the seen and unseen is more capable, more knowledgeable, and more tuned into the events that move in all realms of existence.
The secret masters of the druids, the hierophants, had the ability to travel the elemental planes.
