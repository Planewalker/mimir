The lord of strife, Belinik (bell-in-ick), is chaotic+evil. The prince of terror is the Cerilian Power of war, strife, competition, and hatred. His symbol is the crossed axes. He inspires male Vos warriors to be savage in their attacks, merciless in their conquests, and fearless in their defeats. He is allied with Kriesha against his enemies Haelyn, Cuira√©cen, Avani, Laerme, Erik, and Ruornil. Belinik accepts worshipers of any non-lawful alignment. His worshipers include any that wish to use murder, torture, and other horrid deed as a means to an end: the control of others through fear. The hour of the dusk is holy to Belinik. 
His Realm in Cocytus, the second Layer of Pandemonium, is called the Striving. The Striving is a gloomy and desolate place where warriors that served Belinik in life now contest against each other eternally. Here the strongest battle the weak to gain their lord's notice. Belinik allows all who wish to enter access to his realm, but they must fight for their survival. For those who are at the top there are luxuries and wealth beyond the imagining while those at the bottom are condemned to make do with the meager comforts that can be found in the cold hills that cover the realm.
