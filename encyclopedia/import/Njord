Njord (also spelled Niord), is an intermediate deity of the Vanir pantheon. He is the father of Freya and Frey, and the former husband of Skadi. Before Skadi, he was married to Nerthus, the mother of Freya and Frey.
Njord's portfolio includes burials, commerce, sea, ships, wealth, and the winds. He is neutral good. His role as protector of the dead is similar to Odin's, but he watches over less adventurous folk, not requiring them to have died in battle. He calms the storms started by Aegir. He acted as a negotiator after the disastrous war between the Aesir and Vanir.
Njord's Realm in Vanaheim is Noatun, the Shipyard. It is built to accomodate his enormous height; he can often be found fishing in the cold, foggy waters offshore.
