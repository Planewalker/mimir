A realm [/b]is the special domain of a Power, shaped to become an extension of the power's will and personality. Most realms are in the Outer Planes, but some are in the Inner Planes, the Astral or Ethereal, Demiplanes or even the Prime+Material.
Realms are of finite size, though they may seem incalculably vast from within. Sometimes pantheons or other groups of deities pool together their powers to create communal realms like Olympus, Asgard, Arvandor, the Marketplace Eternal, the Gates of the Moon or Tir na Og.
