The Children of the Vine, also known as Revellers, are members of a Sect that first sprang up on Arborea. Many Sensates became enamoured of the pleasures of the Gilded Hall, and sought only self-gratification. The most degenerate of these hedonists broke off from the Sensates. The Society of Sensation, in turn, was not exactly sad to see these folks go. Their Faction has enough of a reputation for pleasure-seekers as it is. Those who were honest (and barmy) enough to admit that they cared only for pleasure and not for learning the truth joined the Revellers.
