Barbas serves Mephistopheles as chamberlain, running the citadel of Mephistar and seeing to the security of Mephistopheles’ treasure. Proud and arrogant, Barbas is as openly cruel as any devil in Cania is allowed to be under the rule of Mephistopheles. Totally unscrupulous and dishonest, Barbas is kept in check — and the treasure in his care where it is supposed to be — by the combined scrutiny of Bele, Adonides, and Mephistopheles himself. He retains his position by the brilliant deceptions he practices in the name of security, catching or misdirecting the spies of other arch-devils and deflecting the greed of those native to Cania. 
Barbas appears as a giant, bearded man with large lips and an enormous belly. He wears voluminous robes, which conceal his forked tail, hooves, and crimson skin covered with thick, oily black hair. Barbas is lazy and gross-bodied, but snake-quick in battle.
