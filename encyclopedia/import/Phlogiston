Phlogiston, or the Flow, is a substance that is neither fire, nor air, nor water, nor earth, found only outside the crystal spheres of the Prime Material Plane. There it flows in rivers, speeding Spelljammer vessels from sphere to sphere at speeds not attainable anywhere else. 
Phlogiston is rainbow-colored and dangerously flammable. It can be safely breathed by air-breathing and water-breathing races. Those who get lost in it for too long go into a kind of hibernative state, not aging or needing to eat, breathe, or drink until they are brought back into an atmosphere, sometimes centuries later.
