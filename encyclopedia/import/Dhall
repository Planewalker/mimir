Dhall[/b]
The elderly scribe looks very old... his skin is wrinkled and has
a slight trace of yellow, like old parchment. Dead charcoal gray eyes
lie within an angular face... a non-human face, as the ears narrow to
points. A large white beard flows down the front of the black robes
like a waterfall. He coughs occasionally. The book he works in front of
is huge, and seems to contain many names.
Dhall is a Dustman in Plugin &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Not Found. He is a scribe who catalogs all the corpses who come to the Mortuary. He respects the right of non-Dustmen to find their own truth. He is old and nearing True Death.
