Delleb is a god of reason and intellect among the pantheon of Oerth. He is a great rival of Syrul, the goddess of deception, but allied with St. Cuthbert, Boccob, and Lirr. He sponsored the apotheosis of Daern.
Delleb is an old man with olive skin tone. His head is balding, leaving only short tufts of gray hair on the sides and back. He wears reading glasses and carries a large book and quill pen. He is accompanied by a large, sapient black dog named Shadow.
Delleb's Realm, the Great Library, can be found among the mountains of Solania.
