Savras, the All-Seeing, is the stoic god of divination and truth in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting. He oftens looks into the future, although he is unable to change what he sees. He was originally a god of the South, although his divine duties overlapped with those Azuth's; both were the patron of mages in service to Mystra. The two gods fought, and Azuth won by capturing Savras in his staff (he has recently been let out). He does not feel any ill will towards Azuth, although his new position isn't his favorite either. Savras' church is small but organized, most of the clergy serving as oracles or wandering and speaking prophecies as they go.
Adjacent to Azuth's realm in Arcadia is a small series of caverns called The Eye. It is said that all Savras' knowledge about the past and future is recorded here in the form of thoughts that ring in the air, making the place eerily similar to the realm of Ilsensine. These echoing thoughts contain deep insight into past, present, and future, but it would take a remarkably strong mind to sort through them.
