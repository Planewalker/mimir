Balors (BAL-ore) are among the greatest of Tanar'ri. They are the ultimate commanders of the forces of the Abyss in the Blood War. They have an tenuous alliance/rivalry with the Mariliths, their strategists, and the Nalfeshnee, the judges of souls who supply them with their troops. 
Balors resemble enormous, bat-winged, red-skinned humanoids covered with flames and brandishing whips.
