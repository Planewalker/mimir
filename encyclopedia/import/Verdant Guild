The Verdant Guild, also called the Wylders, is a Sect originally formed in the Beastlands, which believes that wild, untammed wilderness and wild areas free of civilization deserve to be preserved and cherished. The wild predates civilization, and while progress and development aren't to be destroyed or halted, they must be developed alongside a healthy respect for and preservation of the natural world. The Verdant Guild holds that places of untouched wilderness must be protected from those who would seek to do them intentional harm and destruction. To this end, the Wylders hold up the Beastlands as one of the primary examples, and they strive to keep it free of even the slightest influence of fiends, other evil groups, and those who might seek to shamelessly exploit it without respecting it.
