The Great Modron March is an event that occurs every 17 grand+cycles (a grand cycle consists of 17 cycles). At this regular interval, that can be counted on like clockwork, an army of modrons erupts from Mechanus through the Portal of Automata and heads towards Fortitude and through its portal to Arcadia. From there they travel through that pleasant land to a portal to Mount Celestia and then to the portal that leads to Excelsior and on and on, threading their way clockwise through the Outer Planes. This process is repeated as the March travels clockwise around the Great Wheel, surveying and taking stock of any changes to the planes since the last March nearly 300 years earlier. Their path is unchanged from the last time they travelled even if the landscape has. Thus if a new Burg has sprung up along the path, the March will wade through it, structures, entities and all.
Along the way, folk will watch in awe, and some will join for a variety of purposes- graybeards will study the modrons, Anarchists, Sinkers and Xaositects will attempt to stop, or at least harass, the March. Others will just try to make some profit, seeing the March as a travelling fair that presents a chance to make a bit of Jink. Still others will just want to pick the bones of the deaders the Modrons march across. This will generally die out as the March passes Xaos.
Of note is the unscheduled March of a few years back. For some, generally Dark, reason, the March occured over a century early. Chant is that Primus had become addle-coved.
