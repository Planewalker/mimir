Like Corellon Larethian, Labelas Enoreth variously appears as both male or female (and sometimes both or neither). Regardless of gender, Labelas always has silvery hair and misty gray eyes. This deity wears pale-colored robes of green, blue, white and gray. At the creation of the elven races, Labelas blessed them with longevity, and pronounced that the passage of time would do little to alter their appearances, as it did to the other races. Labelas knows the future and past of every elf and all elven-related creature.
Labelas dwells with the rest of the elven pantheon in Arvandor. The god gets along well with the rest of the Seldarine, and has an understanding with Chronepsis. Labelas considers Yeenoghu to be an especial foe.
His realm, the Vanishing Tower, is seldom visible. When it appears, it may manifest anywhere in in Arvandor. Its arrival is said to be a portent of trouble.
