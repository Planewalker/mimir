Where the cardinal Elemental+Planes - Earth, Air, Fire, and Water - meet the positive and negative Energy Planes are the quasielemental planes.
Bordering the Positive+Energy+Plane are Mineral, Lightning, Radiance, and the cool mists of the Plane+of+Steam.
Bordering the Negative Energy Plane are Dust, Vacuum, Ash, and Salt. The Doomguard keep a citadel on each of the negative quasielemental planes where they border the Negative+Energy+Plane.
