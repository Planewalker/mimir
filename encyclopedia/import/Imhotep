Imhotep is an ascended demigod of crafts and medicine in the Egyptian Pantheon. He is neutral good. His worshippers are mostly peaceful healers, scientists, and architects who insist knowledge must be used for the greater good.
Imhotep dwells in the Offering Fields, part of the complex of realms his pantheon maintains in the Outer Planes.
