Ipos was once a mortal scholar of the planes and deities in the dawn of history. He sought, like the present-day Fraternity of Order, to learn the fundamental laws by which the Multiverse operated. He was the first to learn of the vestiges, and was so disturbed by the idea of them that they became his sole obsession. Ultimately, he became a vestige himself.
