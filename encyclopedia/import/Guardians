The Guardians ("Caretakers") is a SectÂ who believe in Good and protection for its own sake. They do not have a formal structure, but any member can always count on other members to aid them if they ask. Also, as Caretakers can be found throughout the Multiverse, knowledge is their greatest weapon and is freely shared, but only between members.
