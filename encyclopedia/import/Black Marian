Black Marian is a cleric of Bragi who sings at the Singing Fountain in The Lady's Ward, an enormous pool where the waters are carefully pitched, located between the City+Court, Palace of the Jester, and Twelve Factols tavern. Black Marian has been there for as long as anyone can remember, and in Sigil that's a long time. Marian's songs are otherworldly and haunting, and she can use them to foretell the future.
