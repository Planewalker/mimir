Umbral blots (also called blackballs) are mysterious and extraordinarily dangerous creatures. No one knows precisely how they came into being, or even if they are alive, though some whisper tales of a mysterious race of beings called the Old Ones, who are thought to dwell somewhere beyond the Multiverse.
Umbral blots are relentless, moving in a straight line toward their victims, disintegrating all they touch.
