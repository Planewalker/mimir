This disease typically affects those who are severely wounded in the Plane of Limbo. Slaadi and other natural inhabitants seem to be immune to it, though Githzerai are susceptible. 
Limbo lockjaw follows deep penetrating and crushing wounds with extensive tissue damage. It causes the muscles in the surrounding tissue to spasm and seize up, and can result in death. Spasms of the cheek muscles set the face in a peculiar, sarcastic grin atÂ  the time of death.
