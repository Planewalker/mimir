Yeenoghu is a powerful Tanar'ri lord. He encourages cannibalism and necrophagia in his cultists. He has risen to the status of a lesser god since he took the majority of the worship of the gnolls away from their earlier patron, Gorellik.
One of Yeenoghu's vassals is Doresain, the King of Ghouls, though it's said his control over the king is sketchy at best.
Yeenoghu's greatest foe in the Abyss is Baphomet, the tanar'ri lord of mazes.
