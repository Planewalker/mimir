Yagnoloths are minor nobles of the Yugoloth society. They are lords of fiefs and all who enter these fiefs are subject to their rule. They in turn answer to the arcanaloths who rule over them.
Yagnoloths are horrible creatures with two unequal arms, one man-sized and the other giant-sized. These creatures are large humanoids with scaly red skin and bulky muscles. Their horrid heads have great wing-like ears. Their facial features, like the personalities of the creatures, are hateful and evil.
