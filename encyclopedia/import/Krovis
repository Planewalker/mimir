Krovis is a Quasi-deity who sleeps beneath the Drachensgrab Mountains on the world of Oerth. He awakes at times when some group threatens to conquer the whole of the Flanaess; he is true neutral, and cares not what their Alignment is. In the past, he opposed the infamous Baron Lum and the Glittering Wizards of the Isles of Woe.
