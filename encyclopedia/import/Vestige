A vestige is the remnant of a being trapped between planar boundaries, beyond life or death.  How a vestige comes to such a state varies from individual to individual; some violate the laws of the multiverse, some offend the gods, and still others are slain but do not quite die.  Vestiges have no contact with reality except through the intercession of a Binder, a practitioner of Pact magic.
So desperate are vestiges to connect with the reality they once knew, they always answer a Binder's call.  Of course, a vestige always tries to impose its will upon the Binder; this influence can be resisted only by the strong-willed.  Since a vestige shares a portion of the Binder's soul, the Binder also manifests a sign that identifies him or her as a host to a particular vestige.  Such a sign can be obvious, like the ram's horns a host of Amon manifests, or subtle, such as the clammy skin manifested by a host of Eurynome.
Known vestiges include the following: Acererak, Agares, Amon, Andras, Andromalius, Ashardalon, Astaroth, Aym, Balam, Buer, Chupoclops, Dahlver-Nar, Dantalion, Desharis, Eligor, Eurynome, Focalor, Geryon, Haagenti, Halphax, Haures, Ipos, Karsus, Kas, Leraje, Malphas, Marchosias, Naberius, Orthos, Otiax, Paimon, Primus, Ronove, Savnok, Shax, Tenebrous, Vanus, and Zagan.
