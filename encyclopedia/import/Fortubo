Fortubo is the Power of stone, metals, mountains, and guardianship in the Suel pantheon. Surprisingly enough dwarves and gnomes like him, but some humans do too. His hammer, Golbi, was forged by Moradin. He is the enemy of derro and their god, Diirinka.
Fortubo's Realm in Solania is called the Empyrean Delve. He appears as a small, almost dwarvish-looking human.
