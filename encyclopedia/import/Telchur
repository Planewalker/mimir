Telchur is a lesser god of cold, Winter, and the North Wind. He is one of the sons of Procan, elder god of storms. He is bitter and brooding, chaotic neutral but not evil. 
He imprisoned, through his priests, the Suel god Vatun, and has thus earned the emnity of Vatun's allies Dalt and Llerg, not to mention Vatun himself. His sister Wenta dislikes him for spoiling the festivities of autumn with the harshness of winter. He seems to be responsible for preventing Loviatar from sending servants into the world of Oerth.
He does, however, have some unusual allies, including the Wolf Lord, Belial, and the slaadi+lords+of+Chaos. His mount is a winged, albino bull.
His Realm in Pandesmos is called the Icicle Palace.
