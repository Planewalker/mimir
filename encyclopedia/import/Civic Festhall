Located on Crystal Dew Lane in the Clerk's Ward, the Civic Festhall was the headquarters of the Society of Sensation before the Faction War. They're still there, but they call themselves the Entertainer's Guild now, since the faction formally disbanded.
The Civic Festhall is famed throughout the Multiverse for its concerts, art exhibitions, jewelers, wine shops, and especially its Sensorium stones. Jugglers, dancers, and singers can be found out in the streets nearby.
