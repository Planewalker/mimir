An undine is an intelligent creatures made of water. It is rare even in the Elemental Plane of Water, its home, and is almost never encountered on the Prime Material Plane. Undines are chaotic in behavior, but have very good intentions and despise evil. 
On its home Plane, an undine normally has a form like a featureless transparent snake. It can easily change shape, sometimes using a form with many tentacles to handle objects. They weave webs of ice to ensnare their opponents.
Undines live far from the realms of the water+elementals, but sometimes visit them. They ally with marids, nereids, and mephits. Their enemies are the Hydrax, spitters, Varrdig, and hordes, as well as watery fiends like hydroloths and wastriliths.
