Luthic, the wife of Gruumsh and mother of Bahgtru, is the goddess of female orcs, orcish fertility, caves, medicine, wisdom, and servitude. She is the deity closest to Bahgtru, and he will follow her commands in preference to all others, even Gruumsh. She is attempting to form an alliance with Hecate, with no progress to date.
She dwells in the realm of Nishrek in Acheron, the same realm as Gruumsh, Bahgtru, and Ilneval. She dwells beneath Gruumsh's Iron Fortress in a great canyon. Her followers there call themselves the Black Claw clan. The females do not participate in the endless battles of the plane, but do tend to the wounded.
She is depicted as a huge female orc with four-foot-long claws.
