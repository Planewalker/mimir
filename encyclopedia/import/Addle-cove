Addle-cove is a Cant term for an idiot, or for describing idiotic behaviour, as in "Tell that addle-cove that Pandemonium hasn't gone quiet; he's just gone deaf!" or "I've had just about enough of that addle-coved tiefling's attempts to convince us that tanar'ri are just 'misunderstood.' I'm going to start smashing!"
