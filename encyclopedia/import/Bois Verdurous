The Bois Verdurous was the sacred, magical tree of the Athar Faction, believed to be a gift from the Great+Unknown. It was covered with fruits or flowers, depending on the season, each of which containing a divine spell that owes nothing to any known divinity.
After the Faction War, its status is Dark. It might have been destroyed, or the Athar might have brought it with them when they left Sigil.
