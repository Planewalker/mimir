Djhek'nlarr is a Githyanki who makes her living mapping the Mazes of the Lady of Pain. Her aliases include Djhek'racknir, Djhek'faa, and Pnorr, among others. Zadara and Rowan+Darkwood have both purchased her services, which are punishable by hard labor or death in Sigil. She's gone so far as encouraging others to defy the Lady's edicts in the hopes that they'll get mazed and she can study them.
