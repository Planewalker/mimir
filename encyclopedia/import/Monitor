Monitors manifest in two different ways. In a Crystal sphere or on the
Outer Planes, they appear as gold-skinned, winged centaurs. Their eyes
and hair blaze as if made of red flames. In the phlogistion, monitors
appear as silver-skinned pegasi, with icy blue eyes and manes.
Monitors are unselfish, just, loyal, and brave Celestial beings. Their absolute, black-and-white code of morality alarms those who compromise or bend rules. They find compromise repellant, and are poor diplomats.
