Math Mathonwy is the Celtic Power of sorcery. He carries a mighty magical staff and wears a torc given to him by the other gods. As master of his household, Math insists that his feet rest in the lap of a maiden whenever possible. He does not tolerate mistreatment of his maiden foot warmers, nor does he abide treachery on their part, and has vented his wrath upon many who have violated his trust. He saves his magic mainly for his own purposes, keeping his family in check, and seldom casts spells for the good of his followers or priests.
Math Mathonwy seldom sends his avatar into the world of men without some mission. It is rare that his avatar will become embroiled in the affairs of humans unless there is some magical experimentation involved. Math Mathonwy is always in search of new magics and humans knowing this can trick his avatar into action, but they might suffer his wrath at a later time.
He resides in his Realm, Corriegrave, in Gehenna's first Layer, Khalas.
