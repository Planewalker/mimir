Mount Celestia, the Seven Heavens, the Seven-Tiered Mountain: this plane is where Law and Good, justice and mercy, join together in more or less perfect balance. As perfect as anything can be in the fractious Outer Planes, at any rate.
Among the Upper Planes, Mount Celestia is rather isolationist; only Arcadia is more suspicious of strangers. Still, all are welcome in the Seven Heavens if they devote themselves to a path of virtue. Only by learning something of the nature of virtue along these paths can one ascend to higher layers of the plane (although, as with everything, there are loopholes).
Layers of Mount Celestia include Lunia, with its eternal twilight and silver sea; Mercuria, with its golden sky; Venya, with its green fields; Solania, with its intimidating mountains; Mertion, with its fields of glory; Joviar, where one can find the ziggurat of Yetsirah, one of the largest and most impressive cities in the planes, the home of the Archon rulers; finally, Chronias is the seventh heaven, the illuminated plane, the great mystery.
