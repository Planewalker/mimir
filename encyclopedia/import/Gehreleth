Gehreleths (GEH-rel-eth) (also called demodands) are hideous fiends found almost exclusively in Carceri. They include the tall, scrawny farastu, or tarry gehreleths; the thick-bodied kelebar, or slimy gehreleths; and the morbidly obese shators, or shaggy gehreleths. 
Gehreleths are the outcast fiends of the planes, savage fighters who create themselves from the bodies of the dead that litter Carceri's spheres. They're universally feared and despised, and for good reason. Gehreleths act as self-appointed prison wardens in Carceri, and they hate Yugoloths - who would challenge them for rulership of the plane - with a passion. 
Gehreleths worship their creator, Apomps the Three-Sided, who sees all the gehreleths do through the obsidian triangles they wear about their necks. Apomps is said to dwell in Carceri's sixth layer, and may be a Baernaloth.
