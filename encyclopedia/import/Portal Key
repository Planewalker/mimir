A Portal Key is just that....The object which opens a Portal. These normally reflect where the portal leads. You won't find a golden dove's feather opening up a door to the Abyss...unless that dove was dipped in the gold while still alive.
Some portals require only a gesture or a thought to get through, like a hearty scream to get to Pandemonium. Each portal throughout the Multiverse has its own distinctive portal key.
