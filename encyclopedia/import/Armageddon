The Battle of Har Megiddo is said to be the last battle Good and Evil will ever fight; the winner will determine the shape of the Multiverse for all eternity.
Before this can happen, the fiends need to complete the Blood War in order to determine which form of Evil will fight the final battle. The celestials make preparations in their own way, stowing away legendary warriors in the islands of Thalasia. 
The Baatezu are collecting millions of Larvae in order to bring about a great working they call the Bringing. This is supposed to be the weapon that will win the Blood War for their side.
