Azzagrat is the Realm of Graz'zt, an Abyssal lord. Azzagrat stretches over three layers, the 45th, 46th, and 47th. Because all three layers are ruled by the same Abyssal lord, they share many traits and have many portals connecting them. One of the common threads among the three layers is the River of Salt, a sparkling crystalline mass of liquid salt crystal. Needless to say, submersion in the river is deadly. Other features include Portals between the three layers that appear as groves of viper trees and ovens of green fire. But given Graz'zt's cruel sense of humor, some green-fire ovens are simply full of fire and don't contain portals at all. The environments of the three realms are not terribly dangerous; each resembles a twisted version of the Material Plane. For instance, the 45th layer is like a constantly gray, rainswept steppe. The 46th layer is illuminated from the ground, so that shadows are strange and rise like columns of darkness into the sky. The 47th layer (only reachable from the previous two layers, never from the Plain of Infinite Portals) is lighted by a blue sun. Here flames are purple instead of red, and they deal cold damage. Thus, creatures normally immune to fire might be surprised when they approach the flames. Graz'zt's Anthill of Zelatar can be found on all three layers and each level contains a Burg or two of its own.
