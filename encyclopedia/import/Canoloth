The canoloths are the scouts and skirmishers of the Yugoloth armies, yet sometimes they are used as guardians or bodyguards for more powerful 'loths. They stand around 4 feet tall at their back and weigh around 350 pounds. They resemble an armored bulldog in appearance and stands roughly chest high on a human. A long, barbed tongue, dripping with a foul substance, hangs from a mouth composed of both a vertical and horizontal set of jaws. Strangely, the creature possesses no eyes or visual organs that one can see.
