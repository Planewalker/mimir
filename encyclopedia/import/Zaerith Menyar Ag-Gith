Zaerith Menyar Ag-Gith, the Great Githzerai, is the immortal, self-proclaimed god-king of his race. He rules from the Tower of Illumination in Limbo's Floating City, and exerts subtle control over the generals of Shr'akt'lor. He is both a powerful spellcaster or psionicist and a powerful warrior.
The githzerai revere him as a great protector of their freedom, but they do not worship him. He is not truly a Power.
