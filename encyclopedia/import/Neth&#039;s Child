Neth's children, also called nethlings, are formed directly from the substance of the Demiplane+That+Lives. Each child is an Avatar of Neth, so to speak, exploring the planes, gathering knowledge for its parent. They are insatiably curious, knowing almost nothing to begin with but wanting to know everything. Ultimately they return to Neth, who reabsorbs them and with them the knowledge that they've gained.
They can take many forms, but generally they resemble pinkish circular membranes ten feet in diameter, with a fleshy bulb in the center. They can shift forms to some degree, making themselves look roughly humanoid in order to better interrogate humanoids. They can also absorb other living beings, killing them and absorbing their memories.
Very rarely, a nethling goes rogue, gaining an independent personality instead of considering itself simply an extension of Neth.
