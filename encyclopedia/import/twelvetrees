Long ago, twelve devas were captured by the Tanar'ri and tortured to death on this Layer, catalogued as the 12th layer of the Abyss by the Fraternity of Order. The realm is still haunted by their tormented cries. The evil generated by this act is used to empower works of fiendish magic, most famously the Ships+of+Chaos.
