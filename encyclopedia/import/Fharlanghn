Fharlanghn, god of horizons, distance, travel, and roads, is a well-known deity on the world of Oerth. He wanders that world in person, his Petitioners present in spirit form at crossroads and in mysterious oases. He is the lover of Atroa, goddess of the east wind.
Fharlanghn is allied with Atroa, Celestian, Lydia, Brandobaris, Tarsellis Meunniduin, Keoghtom, Charmalaine (whose apotheosis he co-sponsored), Murlynd, Heward, and Aasterinian. Fharlanghn's brother Celestian, who is popular among planewalkers, is attempting to spread knowledge of Fharlanghn on the planes as well, though (as there are precious few horizons on planes other than the Prime Material Plane) this is slow going.
