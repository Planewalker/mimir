Ethereal filchers are bizarre-looking creatures with a penchant for snatching trinkets from passersby. Their ability to move quickly between the Ethereal Plane and the Prime Material Plane makes them spectacular pickpockets. They originated on the same unknown demiplane as the ethereal+marauders and Nilshai, and are still found serving nishai masters.
Ethereal filchers do not speak.
