Jemorille is an ancient Argenach rilmani. He has, in the past, been assigned to maintain the balance of a number of worlds on the Prime Material Plane, including Athas, Oerth, and Krynn - at least, so he claims. Every one of his positions ended in cataclysmic disaster. Due to his incompetance, he has been assigned to Sigil - probably to get him out of the way. 
Posing as a servant of Shemeshka the Marauder, Jemorille carefully manipulated the high-ups of the city toward the Faction War. Another disaster on his record. 
But Jemorille's not done with the City of Doors yet. Not by a long shot.
