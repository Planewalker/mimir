Gullveig, of the Vanir pantheon, is a lesser goddess of black magic and greed. She is lawful evil. She is worshiped by misers, witches, and thieves; misers and thieves worship her on moonless nights, and witches worship her under the full moon.
Gullveig is responsible for the war between the Aesir and Vanir; after the Aesir attempted to kill her, the Vanir sought revenge for the slight against their sister.
Like many of the Vanir, Gullveig has two realms. One is in Gehenna, and the other is in Vanaheim. The names of these realms are not known.
