Grumbar[/b] is the largest and most powerful of the elementals of earth, calling himself their "boss." His other titles include King of the Land Below the Roots and Earthlord. He is the size of a mountain, physically a part of his plane. When he manifests, it's usually as a gigantic face in a cavern wall. He does not bargain. He embodies the earth, stability, and resistance to change.
Like other elemental+rulers, Grumbar has mortal worshippers, but holds himself distant and aloof from them. His enemy is Akadi.
