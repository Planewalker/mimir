A white-skinned, elflike race of outsiders, the kamerel inhabited the Outlands near the Spire long before the coming of the Rilmani. They symbolized Neutrality's desire to be left alone, and rather than fight the rilmani when they came they retreated into the Plane+of+Mirrors, abandoning their cities to the new race.
