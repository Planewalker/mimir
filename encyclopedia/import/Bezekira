Bezekiras, or hell cats, are large devilish cats nine feet in length. They are native to Baator, moving about, constantly on the watch for some chance to do evil. They are intelligent and use telepathy to communicate amongst themselves and others. They cannot be seen in the presence of any light source.
The greatest of their kind is the exile Bist.
