Where do gods come from? A question for philosophers, surely. And yet it seems that on the Outer Planes some seemingly intractable philosophical dilemmas have concrete answers.
When enough people believe in a god of lawful evil (whether it existed before or not), it manifests on God Street, a literal (if infinite) avenue in the iron city of Dis. There, the enigmatic statues that line the street come to life as minor deities, too weak to create their own realms as yet, but still a true power, with all the glory and might that entails. The temples they build to their glory may be far, far bigger inside than they seem from without.
Of course, now that we've solved the question of where gods come from, we're led to still another mystery: where does God Street come from?
