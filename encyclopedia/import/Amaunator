Amaunator is a dead god of the sun, order, law, and time, once worshipped on Toril.
After the fall of the ancient kingdom of Netheril, Amanator was abandoned by his followers because they felt he had abandoned them, doing nothing to prevent the disaster.
Some claim that Amaunator has been reborn as Lathander, god of the dawn.
