Kelanen, the Prince of Swords, is a popular hero+deity of Greyhawk, a patron of swords and the Balance between the various alignments. He wrested the now-lost blade Fragarach the Answerer from an alien god, and created the legendary Final Word swords. He was among those who aided in the imprisonment of the demigod Iuz. Most commonly, he appears as a fair-skinned man with a silver scar across his face. The scar is a result of the strange magical trial he had to endure to gain his title.
