Advespas are female, wasplike Baatezu that patrol the skies of Baator. They are often found under the command of more powerful baatezu, such as Amnizu.
An advespa looks like a huge, heavy-bodied wasp with a female face and small, antennalike horns, mammarylike features, dripping mandibles, dark insectlike wings, and a chitinous hide. Its lower body terminates in a stinger which can be brought up over the creature's head. Unlike insects, they have only four limbs which end in hooklike claws. They can disguise themselves as other outsiders.
Most advespas are completely black, seemingly carved from obsidian, but those of higher station have striations of yellow, red, and orange.
