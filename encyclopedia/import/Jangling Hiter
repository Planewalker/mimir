Jangling Hiter is the City of Chains, home of the kytons. It hangs from the sky in Minauros, the third hell of Baator. 
In theory, kytons are all equal. They don't have or recognize any leaders.
In practice, there is a kyton the kytons listen to more than any of the others, a particularly clever and charismatic blood known as Quimath. He rules the fortress of Panos Qytel, located within the city.
The Baatezu have appointed an overlord over the city of Jangling Hiter, a hamatula known as Pollus Windscreamer. However, he has no real power; the kytons ignore him and do as they themselves decide.
