A wererat in humanoid form tends to be a thin, wiry individual of
shorter than average height. The eyes constantly dart around, and the
nose and mouth may twitch if he or she is excited. Males often have
thin, ragged mustaches. They can also take the form of dire rats and spread disease, as well as their own curse.
Many dwell in Sigil+Below, serving the Master+of+the+Bones, Tattershade, or Many-as-One.
