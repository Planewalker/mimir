Malphas was an elven nobleman with aspirations of kinghood.  He entered a druidic order and fell in love with another elven druid, and the two of them hatched a plan to fulfill his ambitions.  When other elven noblemen started dying and Malphas's involvement was determined, he intended to flee with his lover.  Instead, she revealed herself to be a drow and mocked him for his naivete.  He died of a broken heart and became a Vestige.
Malphas is also the name of a baatezu+noble. See Malphas (archdevil).
