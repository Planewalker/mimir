A phenonomon that often occurs in the Multiverse: Everything can be traced in circles. Sigil, the Outer Planes, the Outlands, and the Inner Planes all form rings, shapes with no beginning or end. The Unity of Rings principle also means that what goes around comes around, that good deeds will be returned with other good deeds. The Ring-Givers faction is based on this premise.
The other great truths are the Rule+of+Threes and Center+of+the+Multiverse. 
Wizards of the Coast has also released a comic with the name as a title: The Unity of Rings
