Erdeens are lumpy rock beings with long veins of metal and ore running throughout their bodies. They're natives of the Elemental Plane of Earth. Fascinated by the chaotic instability of earth, these elementals feel amazed that so many creatures view it as a stable element. Erdeens have been known to trap adventurers underground and engage them in bizarre discussions about the nature of reality. They consider Galeb Duhr, Hydrax, and hordes as their enemies, and greatly fear air-based creatures.
