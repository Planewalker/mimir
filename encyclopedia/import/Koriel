Koriel, a lawful good intermediate deity, is the god of the ki-rin. His portfolio includes learning, protection, and vigilance against evil. In mythology, he is often the mount of the good-aligned creator god (Pelor is said to ride a ki-rin). Some myths say he is the father of Eachthighern.
He has no permanent outer planar realm, wandering the planes in search of evil encroachments.
