Ordinarily, you'd think beetles would be small things you could crush
with your boot. You wouldn't credit them with intelligence. You
certainly wouldn't credit them with a sadistic streak. At least, you
wouldn't until you saw the trelons. These hissing beetle things live in
the dark, and they have a marked penchant for pain. They seem to be a
breed of Lower+Planar creature, because there's a palpable evil in them.[/b][/b]</p>
