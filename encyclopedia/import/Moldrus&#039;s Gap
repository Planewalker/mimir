Moldrus's Gap is a twisted channel of dry land in a stretch of swamp and quicksand in Othrys, the first layer of Carceri, near a main channel of the River Styx. The Tanar'ri are at a great advantage in this sort of treacherous, chaotic terrain where the rigid Baatezu formations cannot last. 
As one of the few reliable connections between the River Styx and the bulk of Othrys, Moldrus's Gap is a major battlefield in the Blood War.
