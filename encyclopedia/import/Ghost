Those who visit the planes in such a way (including an Astral Projection spell or, in 2nd edition, an Astral Spell) in which they leave their true bodies behind, tethering their spirits with a Silver cord, is derisively called a ghost or Cord baby by many experienced planewalkers, as this sort of travel involves little physical risk. Many consider it cowardly.
