Azrai, also called the Shadow, is an ancient dead god of evil once worshiped on the world of Aebrynis. He followed the human tribes fleeing the southern continent of Anduria to the northern continent of Cerilia and began recruiting the goblins, orogs, gnolls, and elves of that land into armies bent on the final destruction of the human race. He also corrupted the human nation of Vos.
The war came to an end at Mount Dreismaar, where it looked like the human race would breathe its last. At the last moment, the elves realized that Azrai had betrayed them and turned against their erstwhile allies. The human gods themselves took physical form, realizing the importance of the fight, and every human god the world knew died on that day. Their divine blood fell on the mortal warriors, and those touched by the greatest amount of godsblood became the first of the present-day Cerilian Pantheon.
Remnants of Azrai's sentience are believed to survive as the Cold Rider.
