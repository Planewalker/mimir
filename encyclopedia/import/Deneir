Deneir is a god of Toril, representing scribes, cartography, glyphs and images, literacy and literature.
He dwells in Brux, the second Layer of the Beastlands, sharing a Realm called the Library of All Knowledge with Milil. The library is hosted in several buildings scattered about a lonely wood. The Petitioners of their realm retain their professional skills and knowledge from their mortal existences, although they do not retain other memories of their former lives.
