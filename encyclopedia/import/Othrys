The first layer of Carceri, Othrys&nbsp;(spelled Orthrys in 3rd edition), is the
spiritual home of corrupt politicians and those who betrayed their
country. It consists of a war-ravaged landscape of swamps and stagnant
rivers crossed only by spotted ranges of mountains. Several Greek Titans live on Othrys in the realm of Mount Othrys; furthermore, Raiden maintains his Palace of Thunder on Othrys. The Bastion of Last Hope,
a fortress controlled by the Revolutionary League faction, can be found
on this layer, as can the Tanar'ri-ruled tower of Harrowfell and the
asylum Skullrot where the demon prince Adimarchus is imprisoned.
The Stones of Draetilus are a ring of stones that contain portals to Sigil, Gehenna, and the Prime Material Plane (see Hellbound: The Blood War, The Dark of the War, page 57).
