Tasked genies[/b] may once have been Djinn, Jann, marids, Dao, or efreet, but they have performed a single type of labor for so long that their forms have been permanently sculpted to suit their work. Their profession defines them and rules them; a tasked genie taken away from its work grows weak and sickly. They are of two main kinds: those bound by their profession to a certain location and those kept inactive for long periods betwen bouts of servitude. The latter tend to be insane and violent, but the former are helpful in nature.
Genies have little regard for the castes, classes, and social distinctions of others; though they are unstintingly polite and understand perfectly the nuances of proper ettiquette.
