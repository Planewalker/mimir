Arvenna, the Chanting Grounds, are dusty plains in Mertion, the fifth peak of Mount Celestia.  They are the crucible of warrior souls, but also the scene of choirs, chantries, and even yodeling among the Archons and planars who spend their days in pursuit of perfection in battle. Here are heard the Celestial Bells, which summon warriors to battle and to prayer. Every body annointed by the Heralds of Arvenna regenerates as long as it remains within the boundaries of the training grounds.
The goddesses Mayaheine of Oerth and Tarastia of Mystara can often be found training here with the others.
