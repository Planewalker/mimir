...A beige-skinned female wearing a dark-purple bodysuit laced up as tight as the skin of a plum.  She jumped back, lavender eyes widening enormously, and her six-fingered hand went for a small haversack that hung against her hip - no, for a wicked dagger tucked into a band around her left thigh.
"Sod it all!" she yelled, slashing the blade back and forth in front of her. She was short, compact, and quite curvy. Inch-thick curls of whitish hair covered her small head like lamb's fleece, and in place of ears, she had only slits of skin. "I oughta slit yer throats, poppin' up in front o' me like that!" Her thin black lips barely framed a wide mouth filled with a jumble of squared-off teeth and pointed fangs.
That's the description of the Tiefling Annah in the official Plugin &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Not Found novel by Ray and Valerie Vallese. It bears no physical resemblance to the Annah of the computer game.
Annah is an adolescent Tiefling rogue, adopted daughter of Pharod, the King of the Collectors in the Court of Ill Winds. She discovered the corpse of the Nameless One and sold it to the Dustmen. Later, she ends up as part of his adventuring party and even a possible love interest.
