The Prime+Material world of Oerth</a> has many hundreds of divinities; the following just includes the human deities known to the Flanaess, the eastern portion of the continent of Oerik. And maybe not all of those.</p>
Oerth, unlike many spheres on the Prime, has no known Overpower watching over it. Its deities make pacts among themselves not to interfere too closely with the Material Plane, but there is nothing enforcing these pacts save their desire to avoid a godswar.
