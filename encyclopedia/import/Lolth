The Demon Queen of Spiders, Lolth is mistress of the 65th and 66th layers of the Abyss. Though a powerful goddess, Lolth has little interest in dominating the other Abyssal lords; instead, she concentrates on tormenting and testing her mortal worshipers, who include chitines, araneas, and dark elves. 
According to myth, Lolth was once an elven goddess of weavers and destiny, dwelling with the other gods of the Seldarine in the plane of Arborea, where her worshipers produced the best silk in the Multiverse. After trying to usurp the throne of Corellon Larethian, she was named Tanar'ri and cast into the Abyss.
Her name is sometimes spelled and pronounced Lloth. She is served by the fiendish spiders and the Yochlol. She shares her Realm with her thrall Kiaransalee, her consort Keptolo, and her champion Selvetarm.
