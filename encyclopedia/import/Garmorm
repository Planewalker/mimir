Garmorm are wormlike creatures with an enormous maw, and the faces of their victims pressed against their hide. The maddened faces sing strange, disturbing songs in the Astral Plane, where the garmorm makes its home. Garmorms who have devoured spellcasters can cast spells as well.
Garmorm are enemies of the Terithran, though no one knows why. Occasionally garmorm will ally with Githyanki. It is not known if they have any connection with other wormlike planar cratures such as the Psurlon.
