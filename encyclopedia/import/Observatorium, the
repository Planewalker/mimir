The Observatorium is a Demiplane, perhaps the axis around which the cosmos revolves. The planar lore describing the Observatorium portrays it as a great mechanical sphere within a huge torus, and devices of unknown purpose encrust both sphere and torus. The visible surfaces are carved with figures of lost deities and dead outsiders. In some ways it vaguely resembles a Dimensional sextant, but on a grander, more baroque scale. The Observatorium demiplane is otherwise a chunk of
nothingness that extends only about a mile in each direction, ending in a featureless, impenetrable void. The sphere is empty except for the Observatorium itself, humming softly in the center.
