Of the races native to the Prime Material Plane, half-orcs are most like humans and half-elves. They have no ties to any specific Realm and are thus commonly found traveling, adventuring, and making names for themselves on the planes. The half-orcs have no powers that specifically watch over their race. Some worship the orcish powers; these half-orcs are commonly found in Nishrek, located on Avalas, the first layer of Acheron. Often the orcish powers use the half-orcs as elite troops, since they are usually smarter than full-blooded orcs, and can thus carry out complex battle plans. These half-orc generals are greatly feared upon that plane. Many half-orcs are not drawn to worship the orcish powers, however. They tend to go to the major planar cities, where they find work as soldiers or bodyguards.
