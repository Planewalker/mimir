Collectors are the pathetic remnants of humanity, cast adrift in the Hive. They scrape together an imitation of life by collecting the dead who accumulate in the streets of the Hive Ward and dragging them to the Mortuary in exchange for a pittance from the Dustmen, though they'll also go to unscrupulous necromancers and other types (like Mhasha Zakk) who offer them more. Sometimes they're even paid to collect corpses before they're properly dead.</p>
The King of the Collectors, who rules from the Court of Ill Winds beneath the streets of Sigil, is Pharod Wormhair.
