Bristia Pel was the original Archomental Princess of Good Elemental Fire; it's rumored that she was the mother (with Imix) of Zaaman Rul. 
Bristia Pel allied with the Vaati during their war against Chaos, and was murdered by her allies Ehkahk and Chilimba. As a result, Ben-Hadar turned against Law and fought with Chaos for the duration of the war.
