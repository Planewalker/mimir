Creatures of equal parts reified evil and arcane might, arcanaloths (are-KAN-uh-loth) are the deal-makers and advocates of the Yugoloth race. From the Tower of the Arcanaloths in Gehenna they control the contracts signed with their race. 
Arcanaloths are civilized, sophisticated creatures, generally polite and urbane. Make no mistake, though: they're Fiends, most of them thousands of years old, having climbed through all the lesser Yugoloth castes, learning each lesson in turn and nominated for promotion only at the risk of the personal destruction of those who nominated them. They know many secrets of magic and the Lower Planes. 
Physically, arcanaloths resemble tall humanoid creatures with the heads of foxes, wolves, dogs, hyenas, or jackals. They're rarely seen without fine robes or other expensive clothing.
Unlike most 'loths, arcanaloths can breed their own kind. However, they find this distasteful, and mostly recruit promising candidates from the Nycaloth caste.
By destroying an existing Ultroloth, arcanaloths may rise to ultroloth status themselves.
