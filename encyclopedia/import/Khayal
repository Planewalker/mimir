The khayal are genies of the Plane+of+Shadow. They are the size of tall humans, the same height and build as the Jann, but their skin is a dark, shadowy gray. They are great rivals of the jann - where the jann represent all elemental provinces of magic in balance, the khayal represent the absence of elements, the magic of the primal Shadow of which the Prime+Material is but a reflection. Jann and khayal have been involved in a sometimes cold, sometimes hot war for many centuries. 
Chaotic beings with no allegiance to Good or Evil, Khayal are consummate liars, delighting in tricking those they see as "lesser beings" - which is just about everyone. According to legend, if a "lesser" being proves a khayal was being deceptive, the khayal is honor-bound to grant the unveiler a request. Some khayal feel more honor-bound than others, naturally.
The khayal capital is the City of Onyx.
