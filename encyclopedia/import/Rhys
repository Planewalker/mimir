Rhys, a Tiefling sorceress and monk, is the Factol of the Transcendent Order. She disappeared during the Faction War, avoiding the assassinations and mazing suffered by the other factols, and returned to Sigil to help create harmony among the post-war guilds and factions. She soon discovered that she had volunteered to become part of the Sigil Advisory Council.
Rhys is a darkly beautiful woman with long pointed ears, dusky skin, reddish eyes, and thick, dark hair. She also boasts a reptilian tail and legs like the hind leg of a horse. Even in calm conditions, her hair moves as if ruffled by the wind; sometimes the strands seem to writhe on their own, like serpents. She wears clothing that allows ease of movement, with a cloak and a staff.
She radiates an aura that draws others to her, a natural charisma that she can use to persuade - or intimidate. She's silent unless she needs to speak, and she usually asks questions that are aimed at making a body think about what's really going on. She's never anything other than calm, and tries to instill calmness in others as well.
