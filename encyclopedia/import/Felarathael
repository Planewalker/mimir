Felarathael is a Solar in the
service of Corellon Larethian. He/she is the very image of rathional detatchment, treating all creatures with logic and calm reason. Felarathael always speaks in a slow, measured, immensely reassuring voice, and fights with unhurried skill.
Felarathael, like his/her brother/sister Lashrael, is greatly
revered by the elves, held by some to be a demipower in his/her own
right. Both resemble tall, shining, androgynous elves in gleaming white robes.
