Dao are genies of earth. Males and females are both heavily muscled, bald, with polished skin the color of earth or stone, and fingernails and toenails made of metal.  Males have facial hair. Dao love jewelry.
Noble dao have retractable metal claws instead of nails, and sculpt their beards in fanciful patterns.
Though dao are evil, they are also honorable in a way. They return kindness and fairness, although they'll take whatever they can get as they do so. They are the most industrious and hard-working of genies, continually mining and reshaping their plane, continually exploring other planes. Their economy is based on the trade of raw minerals and slaves in the main, though they also make good architects, engineers, and advisors. 
The dao are ruled by a great khan in a city called the Sevenfold Mazework in the elemental plane of earth. They hate Marid and Djinn, but trade with the efreet. All other Elemental creatures interest the dao only insofar as they can be exploited.
