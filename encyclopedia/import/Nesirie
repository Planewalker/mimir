Nesirie is the Lady of Mourning, a goddess of Aebrynis representing the seas and grieving. She was born 1,500 years ago from the death of an earlier Power, Masela. Her realm in Thalasia is an endless sea filled with the goddess's salty tears. The subrealms of Nesirie's realm, the Waves of Grief, are called Denial, Acceptance, and Surcease.
Nesirie is an ally of Nin-Hursag, who takes solace in the arms of the goddess of grief. Nesirie's husband is Haelyn and her son is Cuira√©cen. Other allies include Avani and Ruornil.
