Go-zu oni are mighty warriors who serve as soldiers in the spirit armies of the Celestial Bureaucracy. They resemble giants with the heads of bulls, wearing fine robes and polished armor. They have powers similar to those of ogre+magi.
They can be found throughout the realms of the Chinese and Japanese pantheons. Their superiors are the Me-zu oni.
