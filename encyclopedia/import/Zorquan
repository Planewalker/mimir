Zorquan is the deity of dragons and dragonness. Just as Corellon Larethian represents the highest ideals of elvenkind, Zorquan represents the central ideals of dragonkind - power, pride, and status. He appears as a perfectly-formed example of any species of dragon.
Zorquan is said to dwell somewhere on the Prime Material Plane. Many legends tell of dragons with the temerity to visit his halls, but none give details on how to get there.
