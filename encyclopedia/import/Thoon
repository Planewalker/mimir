Thoon is an entity or philosophy from the Far Realm that has changed and consumed a group of illithids, now known as the Mind Flayers of Thoon. Their goals, methods, and mentality are now entirely unlike other mind flayers; they are utterly fanatic, caring for nothing but the expansion of Thoon, whatever that may be. They warp and modify other races and create golems in order to better serve Thoon.
