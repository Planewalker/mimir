Tvashtri's Laboratory, also known as Tvashtri's Realm, Workshop, Library, and others, is the Realm of the Vedic Power Tvashtri and is set into the side of a mountain in the Outlands spireward of Sylvania. Within are a jumbled maze of labs, libraries, workshops and construction areas. It is a place a great magic, craftsmanship and knowledge. It produces items that may not be quite as good as those of the Dwarven Mountain, but there are more types of them, some quite exotic.
Surprisingly, Tvashtri's noisy, clattering domain is adjacent to that of Untamo, the quiet, dreaming god.
