Also known as Otzitiotl and the Sun-Prince, Ixion is one of the oldest known powers of the Mystara setting, and may never have been mortal. He is the embodiment of the Sun in all its glory. He is also widely worshiped by centaurs, who believe him to be their ancestor.
He dwells in Elysium, somewhere in the vicinity of the Nest of the Phoenix in Principality.
