Minions of Set are proxies of Set. They appear as warriors wielding swords and dressed in black, scaly plate mail. Each has the power to change its shape into a giant snake, bear, crocodile, hyena, or scorpion. They are created from Set's Petitioners in Stygia. 
Set uses his minions as go-betweens with other creatures in the Multiverse, wooing Nephythys, fighting in the Blood War, keeping order among Set's petitioners, and carrying out the god's will on the Material+Plane. Within the twisted ecology of Stygia, minions of Set are predators; when they're not carrying out their master's wishes, they steal Larvae from the Baatezu to add to their own hordes.
