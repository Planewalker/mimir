Nanna-Sin, also known simply as Sin, Nanna, or Yerah, is the Sumerian god of the moon, fertility, and time. His title is Night's Light.
The god sails the River Oceanus in a great barque shaped like a crescent moon in Eronia, the second Layer of Elysium. In his passing he lights both banks of the river with a lunar radiance which beguiles those who come too near. Enlil keeps him from interacting too closely with mortals (unlike the other Sumerian deities), so he often kills time by spying on Babylonian powers like Ishtar, though if this were discovered it would cause a major interpantheonic incident.
His symbol is a black axe over the moon. His sacred animal is the owl. His colors are silver and blue. His clerics demand a tithe of gems on every full moon. His Proxy, Ishme-Dagon, is a human cleric. Nanna-Sin is chaotic good.
