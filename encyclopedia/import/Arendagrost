Arendagrost, Maw of the+Abyss. According to accounts at the time, the beast vaguely resembled an immense wingless dragon of gargantuan size. Instead of legs, it moved upon a sea of tentacles. In place of scales, it was covered in coarse black fur and had three heads that resembled monstrous horned fiends that breathed bloody acid, fire, and frost. Its six-fold eyes offered instant death to anyone catching their hideous gaze... 
Arendagrost is the most powerful of the hideous spawn of Demogorgon and Malcanthet, and even his father finds him unsettling to look upon.
