Ehlonna is one of the canon dieties known on the world of Oerth and throughout Dungeons and Dragons. She is also known as Goddess of the Woodlands, and that is where most of her followers call home. She is a good aligned diety, tasked with protecting the forests and it's creatures. She is commonly worshipped by human druids and nature-loving clerics.
Deep within the Beastlands Layer of Krigala is the Grove of the Unicorns, a Realm she shares with the like-minded goddess Mielikki. The grove sits at the base of a cluster of great sequoias that form a natural cathedral for those beneath the canopy. The lowest branches of the great redwoods are hundreds of feet in the air, such that those with wings can fly through Ehlonna's cathedral without difficulty. Those who reside within the borders of Ehlonna's realm live in peace with the trees and animals, and they are similarly left alone by the wild creatures. The thinking creatures of the Beastlands adore Ehlonna, such that she is often aware of occurrences that happen far from her domain. True to its name, the grove attracts groups of unicorns. In addition, there are herds of bariaurs in Ehlonna's service. The grove is not far from Skerrit's realm; centaur Petitioners are found in Ehlonna's realm and unicorns in Skerrit's. 
All spells cast by rangers within the Grove of the Unicorns are enhanced, and all spells that create food or water are exceptionally bountiful. Ehlonna and Mielikki have the power to make other alterations to magic within her realm, if they so desire.
Ehlonna's symbol is a rampant unicorn, her favored weapon a longbow.
