The Githzerai word for 'chaos matter', an unusual substance found on the plane of Limbo. The githzerai people are able to shape chaos matter with their thoughts. Experienced anarchs in both Limbo and the gate-town of Xaos forge raw chaos into a shapeshifting metal called karach.
Zerths use this metal to create karach blades. Within githzerai society such weapons are recognised as the symbol of a Zerth. The blades are are entrusted only to those who posess both focus and discipline. Indeed, maintaining the swords edge, toughness and flexibility can only be achived by those who have gained exceptional self-control through their dedication to the teachings of Zerthimon.
