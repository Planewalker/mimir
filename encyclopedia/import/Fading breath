It's said that when an evil Power dies, its last exhaled breath lives on forever to plague the plane it once called home. Tales are told of a putrid wind sweeping over someone who later turns up covered in bloody boils, a look of horror burned into her dead face. Even beings such as Archons and Aasimon are not immune to this ancient gust from the grave.
