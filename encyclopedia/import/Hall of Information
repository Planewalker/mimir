Located on Rook Street in the Clerk's Ward between the Hall of Records and the Hall of Speakers, the Hall of Information is where natives of and visitors to Sigil need to go to get routine information without bothering with touts.
The Hall of Information provides chant on missing people, planar history, employment prospects, addresses of people and businesses, and doubles as a small claims court. It's the place to go to get licenses and pay fines. Its credo is COOPERATION, COMPLIANCE, and CONTROL.
The employees, however, tend to be surly and difficult.
