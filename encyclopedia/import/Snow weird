Snow weirds resemble large, beautiful women composed entirely of brilliant white snow. They have dazzling silver eyes too bright to look at; their lower torsos are blizzards with no discernable features.
Snow weirds are harbingers of boon and doom, predicting weal and safety or warning of dire events to come. They see fluidity in everything.
They are one of two races of Elemental weird linked to elemental cold. They tend more toward the Elemental Plane of Air than their cousins, the ice+weirds.
