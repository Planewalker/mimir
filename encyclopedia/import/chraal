Chraals are elemental beings made from black ice, looking like large humanoids covered in jagged spurs and spines. Cold blue light leaks from their eyes, mouth, and joints of their glistening forms. They're thought to be made from the spirits of evil creatures who died on the Paraelemental+Plane+of+Ice.
