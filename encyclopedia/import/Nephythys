Nephythys is the daughter of Geb and Nut, twin sister of Isis and former wife of Set. She left Set after he murdered his brother Osiris and helped Isis restore him. Because of this, she is guardian of the dead, tombs and, by extension, wealth. She remains in the lonely wastes of Pelion, in her Realm of Amun-thys, long after the rest of her Pantheon left it to protect the relics of bygone ages.
As guardian of wealth, Nephythys herself is somewhat greedy, focusing more on charity than on good works. For this reason she is much beloved by the Fated. As guardian of the dead, peaceful with her state, she is popular among the Dustmen. 
Nephythys manifests as a tall and beautiful woman with eyes that sparkle with gold. She's the mother of Sobek (with Set) and Anubis (with Osiris).
