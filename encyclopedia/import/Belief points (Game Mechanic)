Belief points were a game mechanic introduced in the Planewalker's Handbook to encourage role-playing, especially Factional beliefs but also individual beliefs. The basic premise was that if one followed their beliefs at a risk, they could later affect reality in their favor. Points were given when one's characterÂ followed their beliefs at some risk, the greater the risk, the greater the number of points given by the DM. These points could be used to alter reality by giving automatic success on something requiring a die roll such as a save or a roll to hit or give the character a hint on the Dark of a situation if the character was stumped. Only a limited number of points would be doled out per adventure per character.
