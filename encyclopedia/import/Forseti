The wisest and most eloquent of the Aesir, Forseti serves as the Norse Power of justice and the arbiter of divine disputes. No one has ever found fault with one of his decisions, and Odin often calls upon him to decide matters in which the chieftain of the gods feels he cannot be impartial. Forseti lives in Asgard in a steel and silver palace called Glitnir. Forseti knows when a lie is spoken anywhere in Ysgard and has the power to make any mortal anywhere speak the truth, whether the individual wishes to or not. In his true form, Forseti is a handsome man dressed in a tunic of gold and breeches of silver.
Forseti is most concerned with justice and truth. Whenever a body of men gathers to make laws, there is a chance that Forsetiâ€™s avatar will come to aid them. If this body is making laws that affect more than fifty thousand people, his avatar is sure to appear at the meeting disguised as one of the lords who has a right to attend the meeting. There is a chance that he will send his avatar to aid those trying to throw off the rule of an unjust tyrant.
