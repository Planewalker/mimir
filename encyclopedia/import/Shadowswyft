Shadowswyfts[/b], like gloamings and krinths,Â [/b]are a kind of Planetouched with ancestors from the Plane+of+Shadow. Shadowswyfts are mercurial in temperment, delighting in action as soon as possible. They are tall and slender, with skin ranging from brown to the color of night, with completely black, slanted eyes. They mature quickly, and have short lifespans.
Shadowswyfts tend to be chaotic in nature, associating with other chaotic creatures of all sorts. Most of them worship a god of rogues and merriment; other deities in their pantheon include a god of travel and a god of magic.
Their language uses body movements, position, and facial expressions as much as sound.
