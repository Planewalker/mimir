Trishina, goddess of dolphins, is romantically involved with the sea-elf god Deep Sashelas, often to her chagrin. She is more pacifistic and hopeful than him, and dislikes his infidelity. She divides her time between Mount Celestia and Thalasia, where she holds part of the sea for the spirits of dolphins who have died in defense of their young. She wanders the waters of both oceans, with no particular realm of her own.
Trishina takes the form of a female dolphin, or as a pretty young sea elf female, changing instantaneously at will. 
A lesser goddess, she is lawful good.
