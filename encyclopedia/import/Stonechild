Stonechildren are born of the union of humans and earth+elementals, and resemble 7 foot tall hairless humans made of stone. Most live on the Elemental Plane of Earth, where their numbers are sparse. They occasionally form permanent communities there with various other natives of the plane, building homes on the sides of great caverns with the help of their earth elemental kin.
