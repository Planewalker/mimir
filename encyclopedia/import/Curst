"We say exactly what we think," Trias announced proudly. Can you say as much? How about 'trapped' - can you say that? Trapped in the cell, trapped in the town, can't go up, can't go down. You see, if you can't demonstrate a clear destination and purpose, the wall watch won't let you out of Curst. Curst won't let you out of Curst. The city sinks its hooks into your head, and you just can't leave."

Curst is the Gate-town in the Outlands built around the portal to Carceri. 
Curst is a circular walled city. The portal to Carceri is right in the center of town. The inhabitants of Carceri are all exiles and the descendents of exiles; they put a tremendous effort into locking out the rest of the Multiverse, but really they're only locking themselves in. The lawmen of Curst are brutal and often unfair. They're tools of the local strongman, Tovus Giljaf, in keeping the people of Curst miserable and plotting.</p>
