An ankheg is a Large insectlike Magical beast native to warm plains.  It burrows through the earth, bursting forth to seize creatures and pull them into its tunnels.  If necessary, it can spit acid in order to defend itself.
Fan Material: Ankhegs can be encountered on any plane that has solid ground and edible indigenous life.  Both celestial and fiendish versions are known to exist (i.e., you can apply those templates to it).  On rare occasions, black dragons breed with ankhegs to produce half-dragon ankhegs where marshes border plains, and copper dragons breed with them where hills and plains abutt.
