Three streets from an enormous statue of Bigby, a short walk from the Armory, is the Golden Bariaur Inn. This is a tavern in The Lady's Ward that caters mostly to denizens of the Upper Planes. The tension between lawful and chaotic celestials is palpable, but outright violence is rare. When disputes cannot be solved in any other way, duels are fought at dawn, usually in the skies "above" the streets of the City of Doors.
The pub's named for the doorman, Goldenmane.
