Pyrophors are chaotic fire+elementals with eerily shifting features, resembling flickering coals with fingers of flame that periodically flare out. Perhaps the most evil of the elementals, they revel in the destructive powers of fire, maliciously bathing the Prime Material Plane in “purifying” flame whenever they get the chance. They hate water+elementals, and enjoy bothering the lawful helions.
