Gargantuan in size, Elemental monoliths are great rulers and princes among their kind, obeyed even by the elder+elementals. Of non-unique elementals, only the primal+elementals surpass them. They seldom leave their home planes unless summoned - and only the most powerful spells will pull them away. They have booming voices and the personalities of storms.
