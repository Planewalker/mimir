Mount Olympus is a Planar Path extending from the Pluton in the Gray Waste to the first layer of Arborea, with paths to many Prime+Material worlds in between. Long ago, it also connected to Mount Othrys in Carceri, but the path was severed by the Olympian pantheon after a war with the titans.
It's a staggeringly huge mountain, dotted with trees. The bulk of it exists in the Astral Plane.
