Ibrandul was a lesser deity of Toril, presiding over caverns, dungeons, skulks, and the Underdark. He was chaotic neutral.
Ibrandul was slain by the goddess Shar during the Time of Troubles. She masqueraded as him for a time in order to conceal her deed. Now he's dead, a stony corpse in the Astral Plane. Formally, he had a Realm in Phlegethon, Pandemonium known as Ibrandyllaran.
