The third layer of Carceri, Minethys, is the spiritual home of hoarders,
those who could have aided others with their wealth but decided not to.
It is a parched layer of crimson glowing sand and biting, desiccating
sandstorms. Notable locations on Minethys include Coeus' Temple, dedicated to the Titan of the same name; the Mausoleum of Pain of the dragon god Faluzure; Karontor's Rack of Injustice; and Trickster's Delight, the realm of the naga deity Parrafaire. 
The Sand Tombs of Payratheon can be found in Minethys as well. Local fauna include Sand gorgons and mummy lords.
Minethys is the home of the Gautiere race.
