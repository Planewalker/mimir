Elemental weirds are elemental spirits of feminine shape. They are oracles and seers, sought out for the gifts of knowledge they can offer. They are closely related to elementals and must retain their link to the Elemental+Planes through mysterious pools that are small projections from their planes of origin. They manifest as woman-shaped creatures made from elemental substance.
They are cryptic, riddling beings, rarely providing prophesies that are clear, complete, or easily decipherable. They also do not work for free.
In their immature form, they resemble featureless, serpentine shapes composed of the appropriate element. In that shape, they can be dangerous predators. They stay in close contact with their elements, letting these primal forces whisper tales and portents that they might one day grow wise enough to decipher. They sometimes dwell near their mature kin, protecting them and learning their secrets.
Known kinds of elemental weirds include air+weirds, water+weirds, earth+weirds, fire+weirds, snow+weirds, and ice+weirds.
