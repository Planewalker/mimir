Rellavar Danuvien is the god of frost sprites, acting as a ward against the severe cold. He used to serve Tarsellis a long time ago, but his continuing friendship with Solonor strained their relationship. Now he’s an independent god, though he can count on help from both against the machinations of Auril and Thrym, beings whose power is based on ice and cold. He’s good friends with Erevan Ilesere, who is himself a patron of Faerie folk (though of the larger community of faeries and sprites).
Rellavar dwells in Karasuthra, the first Layer of the Beastlands, in a Realm called the Ice Plains.
