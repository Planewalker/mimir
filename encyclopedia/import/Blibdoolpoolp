Blibdoolpoolp is an ancient deity of a race driven back from their earliest habitats - the kuo-toa. Now her people populate only the Underdark in competition with illithids and Drow.
Imagine a huge, nude human female with the head of a lobster growing from her neck, with lobster-clawed forearms. Now imagine her twisted with the portfolio of darkness, insanity, and revenge. Blibdoolpoolp is said to know deep magical secrets that are part of the fundamental fabric of the universe. 
At least, she thinks she does.
Her Realm, on the Elemental Plane of Water, is called the Murky Depths. It's an expanse of gloomy water that can, at the will of the goddess, become infected with a plague called the Red Tide, though only those she wishes to harm suffer its effects. Unlike the rest of the plane, the Murky Depths have a sandy bottom, where her Petitioners have built a twisted city of coral and stone. Sometimes, her petitioners take the form of chaotic or evil thoughts that drift through the water, haunting and tormenting visitors along with her more substantial servants.
