A singular sound can sometimes be heard here and there, if briefly,
among the many planes. When a mirror shatters, the note might be
discerned. When a wall collapses, the ringing of the tone is somewhat
stronger. When a city burns, the notes form a chord. And when a
continent sinks beneath the waves, the song of dissolution plays out
loud and strong -- for those with the ears trained to hear.
This
mythical melody is something all Doomguard are eager to hear. Some
theorize that should the tones ever be correctly recorded and
formulated, a Faction member with that song ringing in his body would
have unparalleled power -- his every utterance a curse, his every
sword-stroke a killing blow, and his very presence, anathema.
