Eadro is the god of merfolk and locathah; both races credit him with their creation. He belongs to the Asathalfinare and considers Demogorgon to be his greatest enemy. His Realm in the Plane+of+Water is called Shelluria, where living locathah and merfolk mingle freely with petitioners of those races, who take  the form of incorporeal, brightly colored fish. 
Eadro has been missing in action for just over a decade, leaving three proxies in charge of his realm as he attended a matter of importance. In recent months, the powers of his clerics and proxies have begun to wane. Persana has taken charge of the Realm in answer to the proxies' summons, and will soon organize an expedition to try and find out what happened to the missing god.
