The creation of a community of powerful wizards called the Mhagane, the Semblance is a "naked" demiplane without a Border Ethereal or a Wall+of+Vaporous+Color. Visitors see a knot of vapor in the Ethereal Plane, seemingly nothing unusual. But inside the mists there is a region of agitated, unstable ethereal fog called the Tumult, where the substance of the demiplane boils into the greater Ethereal; there's a danger here of the mists boiling away a portion of a visitor's own substance.
Inside the Tumult is a landscape not unlike the Material+Plane, with rivers, trees, mountains, and seas. There the Mhagane live, grow, and die in hidden isolation, protected from the nameless threat which drove them to hide here.
