The Tower of the Arcanaloths, or Tower Arcane, is one of the great centers of the Yugoloth race. It rises from the furnace of Chamada in Gehenna. Ruled by Arcanaloths, they plot and scheme, keep the histories of the Lower Planes, and compile contracts on the still-sentient skins of Petitioners.
From within the bowels of the Tower, new Mezzoloths are produced, created bodily from the raw evil of the plane.
