Zagum is a baatezu+noble serving Asmodeus; he commands 30 companies of hamatulas. He is ambitious and cold-blooded, but considers cruelty a self-indulgent waste of time. He has a coarse sense of humor, the better for ingratiating himself among his allies and troops.
Zagum appears as a gigantic hamatula with a fifteen foot long tail and a jagged row of barbed spines running up his back, cumulating in a bony collar edged with spines at the back and sides of his head. His scaled skin is crimson, his eyes yellow and catlike.
