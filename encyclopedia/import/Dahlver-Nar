There are several tales concerning the origin of Dahlver-Nar.  One says he was a powerful cleric whose followers treated his teeth as holy relics after death.  Another says he was a cleric who stumbled upon magical teeth in a red dragon's lair.  Yet a third myth states that Dahlver-Nar was a cleric who forsook his deity in order to pursue Pact magic.  In any case, he is most famous for the magical items known as the Teeth of Dahlver-Nar.
Dahlver-Nar is now a Vestige.  Binders and those who study the history of Pact magic believe that the magical teeth associated with him are the remnants of other beings that became Vestiges, and Dahlver-Nar now suffers his fate because of his use of the teeth.
