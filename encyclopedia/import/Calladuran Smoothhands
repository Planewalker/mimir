Calladuran Smoothhands is the patron Power of the svirfnebli (or deep gnomes). He is a very secretive deity, seeking only to protect his children from the deprivations of the drow, the svirfnebli's dire enemy. According to legend he sits at the center of the world, his hands constantly polishing his magical stone that is the source of the deep gnomes ability to summon earth elementals.
His realm is Deepholm on Bytopia. He has good relations with other members of the Gnomish Pantheon. He is also allied with the myconid god Psilofyr.
