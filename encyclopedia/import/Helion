Helions are intelligent creatures made of fire. They are native to the Elemental+Plane+of+Fire and are rarely encountered elsewhere. Helions are extremely lawful and good, and shun violence.
A helion appears as a twenty foot diameter ring of flame. Helions are famous philosophers and negotiators. Their enemies are the efreet and the aerial+servants, and the pyrophors war against them endlessly. Sollux are somehow related to them.
