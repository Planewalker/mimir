Nemelle is Aelwyn's friend, waiting for her in another bar on the opposite side of the Clerk's Ward. She looks like Aelwyn but with violet eyes instead of golden, and raven hair instead of red. Her speech is like music played by tiny crystal bells.
Nemelle knows the command word for the Decanter of endless water. She and her friend both have strange powers over reality.
