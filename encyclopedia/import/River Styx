The dark, polluted waters of the River Styx touch every Lower+Plane. Their headwaters are thought to be in Pandemonium, where the Styx flows in midair as small streams of only limited potency. Its tangled current flows erratically through the planes, going from Pandemonium to Stygia to all four layers of Acheron to Avernus to the first layers of  Carceri and Gehenna to Oinos to the Underworld in Pluton, through many layers of the Abyss and in hidden places in many other hells. 
Most who attempt to navigate its course will quickly become hopelessly lost. The marraenoloths, the skeletal boatmen of the river, know it full extent instinctually, and can quickly travel from any lower plane to any other lower plane and even the Astral, all for a stiff price. 
The worst thing about the Styx is its amnesiac properties. Even touching the water in most planes is enough to make you forget your entire life.
