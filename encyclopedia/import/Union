Union is a trading city built 80 years ago by the mercanes in the demiplane of Haven. Its buildings are built on a cluster of 100 or so floating islands. 
Union has three main Portals: the Staircase Gate, which leads to the Infinite Staircase; the Material Gate, which leads to various cities of the Prime Material Plane (a different one every day, some never revisited); and the Planar Gate, which leads to other major planar metropolises.
