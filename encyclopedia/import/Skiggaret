Skiggaret is the half-mad god of fear. He prowls the world, driving bugbears to acts of destruction and aggression. He lives in the same layer of the Abyss as Grankhul, an eternally dark place populated by shadows and spectres. He manifests as a jet-black bugbear with red lips, hands, and feet. He smiles in a crazy sort of way.
