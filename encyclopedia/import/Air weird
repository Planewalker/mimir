Feminine spirits of elemental air, air weirds speak of facts and places, speaking in a manner more direct than most elemental+weirds. For these elementals, the world exists as a compass with many choices, each choice a possibility with its own dangers and rewards. Unable to predict the actual future, they supply information regarding the facts of a journey.
They appear as ghostly, translucent women composed of flowing vapors. Their eyes are deep blue, and their hair appears windblown. The lower halves of their bodies are tendrils of mists.
They ask for gifts from far-flung nations, lost evironments, or other planes. A grain of sand which was once a mountain eroded by time, or a gear from Tvashtri's Laboratory in the Outlands would both be acceptable.
