Morax is a baatezu+noble in the service of Asmodeus, leading nine companies of pit+fiends. He is a being of few (and well-chosen) words, but exults in a good fight. He often wrestles with the pit+fiends under his command, hurling them about and roaring. He is respected by the pit fiends for his fairness to them and his loyalty to Asmodeus. He despises weakness, and is angered by creatures who bluff or presume to have a strength or station they do not possess or deserve. Morax respects Bifrons, Asmodeus, and other physically strong devils, and has little time for “sneaks” or those who “hide behind magic” (for example, Phongor and Adramalech, in Nessus). Morax and Alastor are good friends, and will aid each other when one is in need, knowledge of the situation and opportunity permitting.
Morax is a cloven-hooved, humanoid devil. He has a bull-like head, with massive curved horns (somewhat like Moloch), bat-like wings, and heavily muscled arms. He has a short forked tail. His entire body is a dark, dirty brown in hue, and his eyes are scarlet. He has a cluster of 2-inch-long spines on his chest, and in battle loves to hug victims against this cluster.
