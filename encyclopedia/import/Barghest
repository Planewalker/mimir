A barghest is a goblinlike Fiend native to Gehenna. They are much larger than goblins and have blue skin, where most goblins are yellowish or red. Like Nabassu, they send their young to other planes to feed and mature. 
Barghests also have the ability to take on a form similar to that of a large and fearsome wolf. The descendants of their matings with goblins are called worghests.
