Hlal, known as the Jester and the Pursued, is a draconic god of humor, storytelling, and inspiration. Known as Avachel to the elves, she is a boon companion of Erevan Ilesere. She delights in both sophisticated wordplay and humiliating pranks. Legend has it she is pursued by Faluzure for a particularly elaborate joke she played.
Hlal is a chaotic good lesser deity, manifesting as a copper or faerie dragon. She dwells in Arborea on the lower reaches of a great slope.
