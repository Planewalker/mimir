Thendar are a wandering race whose home is the Astral Plane but who can be found on any plane of existence. They have lifespans ranging in the thousands of years, and seek new experiences to relieve their ancient boredom. With their long lives, the Astral's flowing time effect is nothing to them.
They are tall, slender humanoids with golden skin and silvery hair, and glowing white eyes. They usually wear hooded robes of durable gray or blue material. They have a natural, constant ''true seeing'' effect and can understand all spoken languages, among many spell-like abilities.
The Githyanki despise the thendar, who respond with an annoyed indifference. The thendar are on good terms with astral devas and astral whales.
