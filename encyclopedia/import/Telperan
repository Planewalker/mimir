The telperi (singular: telperan) are a race of Galadur native to Arcadia and Mount Celestia. They resemble seven-year-old human or demihuman children, but also take the forms of dogs, mice and hawks. In their true form, they appear as extremely handsome or beautiful humans only two and a half feet in height, with golden-brown to golden-pink skin, golden hair, and golden amber eyes. They have pure white hawklike wings.
They often serve lawful good spellcasters as familiars.
