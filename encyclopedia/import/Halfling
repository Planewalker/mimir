Most halflings are found in the Green Fields, located in Venya, a layer of Mount Celestia. Green Fields is a pastoral paradise, perfect for farming, and thus perfect for many halfling temperaments. It primarily exports food to other locales on the planes, and some halflings may be found outside their native realm along with these shipments. Generally halflings that were raised in Green Fields have a lot of adjusting to do to fit in on the planes, and are often as clueless as any prime. Those who are not found in Green Fields are most likely to be encountered in the Flowering Hill, located in the Outlands. The demipower Urogalan is part of the Halfling Pantheon, but he serves as a judge of the dead for the halflings, and not many of their race worship him, thus there are few petitioners associated with his realm.
A few halflings are also found in Limbo, particularly near the village of Barnstable and near the floating rocks nicknamed Yondalla's Teeth.
