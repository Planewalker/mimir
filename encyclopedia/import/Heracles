The son of Zeus and the mortal woman Alcmene, Heracles was strength personified. While still an infant, he strangled two huge snakes with his bare hands. Of course, Zeus’ wife, Hera, was jealous of the affair that begot Heracles, and she is always conspiring to bring him harm. Heracles is a fearless adventurer whose many escapades are the stuff of legend. A robust, cheerful man, he has an appetite for food and women that almost equals that of his divine father.
Although he visits Olympus from time to time, and has been known to aid the gods in their struggles, Heracles spends most of his time in the world of men. He is a stout man with a long beard, usually wearing a lion’s skin for clothing.
Heracles is a dangerous fellow to have dealings with, for he will take offense at the slightest insult. Anyone tricking, deceiving, or failing to express the proper gratitude is placing his life in Heracles hands, for the demi-Power has a violent temper. Heracles will never have anything to do with wizards or priests, as he has a profound distrust of magic.
