Translators are messengers of the gods of neutrality, occasionally others. They look like spheres of shining silver 3 feet in diameter. They pulse with an inner yellow light when they're carrying a message. They travel the planes at tremendous speeds, and when threatened attack with shining silver beams of light.
Translators do not have a society. They are content in absolute servitude to the gods.
