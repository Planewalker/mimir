Eachthighern (ek-tee-arn) is the lord of unicorns and pegasi. He allows few to ride him: only Oberon and Fionnghuala do so with any regularity, although Hanali Celanil has done so on occasion.
Some legends say that Eachthighern's father is the ki-rin god Koriel, and his mother is Erevan Ilesere, who changed form and sex to bear him.
Eachthighern is the father of Lurue in her aspect as Yathageara.
