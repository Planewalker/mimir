Planar spiders are intelligent, plane-traveling arachnids with a vast, but odd civilization. They can both the astral and ethereal planes at will, provided they're currently in a coexistant or coterminus plane. It's thought that they're related to phase+spiders. Their home plane is almost certainly a Demiplane in the Deep Ethereal; it is described as a plane with cities creafted from imperishable white webs. There are many nations of planar spiders there - those from the nation of Chak are most common elsewhere. 
Araneas are the result of planar spiders mating with spiders native to the Material+Plane.
