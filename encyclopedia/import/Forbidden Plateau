Deep within the primeval rain forests of Krigala, not far from the banks of the Oceanus, a great, wide pillar of volcanic stone rises hundreds of feet into the air above the canopy of the surrounding trees. Atop this pillar is a vast plateau, vertically isolated from all around it. The Forbidden Plateau is a self-sufficient ecosystem populated by dinosaurs and green-furred humanoids known as beastfolk.
The Plateau is the home of the Dinosaur Lord. The Torilian powers Thard Harr and Ubtao dwell here as well.
