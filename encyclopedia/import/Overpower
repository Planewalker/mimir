Overpowers are the guardians of the Crystal spheres, beings that make the ordinary powers look like mere mortals in comparison. 
Overpowers care nothing for mortal prayer or worship, and grant no spells to divine spellcasters. Usually they are beyond mortal knowledge entirely. Their function is to regulate the affairs of the powers within a particular Crystal sphere, and are not concerned with non-divine matters. 
Overpowers have no influence outside the crystal spheres they watch. They shouldn't be confused with powers+beyond+the+powers who have ascended beyond the known Multiverse.
Ao of Toril is an example of an overpower.
