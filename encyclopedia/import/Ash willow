Ash willow is a tree native to the Elemental+Plane+of+Fire. It has dark red bark that can grow up to 120 feet in height. Ash willow thrives in pools of magma and rivers of lava, raining ash and recreating the landscape around them, creating plains of ash. Their extensive root systems spawn 1-3 new trees every month. Visitors in ash willow forests may feel like they're in the middle of a snowstorm, so thickly do they rain.
