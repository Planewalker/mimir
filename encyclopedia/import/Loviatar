Loviatar, the Finnish Power of agony, hurt, pain, suffering, torment, torture, and torturers. She is the sister of Kiputytt√∂ and the daughter of Tuonetar and Tuoni.
Like Mielikki, she has gained a following on Toril rather than give into the wasting apathy that seems to have afflicted the rest of her Pantheon. She is also trying to enter Oerth, but is stymied by a site called the Hanging Glacier of Alisedran, which prevents her servants from entering. This glacier seems to be the creation of the god Telchur.
Her divine Realm is called Ondtland. Found in Mungoth, the third furnace of Gehenna, it's a wasteland of ice and snow, filled with carnivorous caribou and packs of dire wolves, faithful creatures she rewards with cruelty and abuse. Her Palace of Pain there is a fortress of ice, protected by the mighty spells of her parents from the occasional hot spots of the Layer. Its surface is as sharp as a wall of razors. The aurora over Loviatar's palace is said to be beautiful.
She appears as a beautiful, cold maiden. When she speaks, a cold wind blows.
