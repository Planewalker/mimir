As the Celtic Power of healing, Diancecht cares for the sick and wounded without regard to their worship. He is so insanely jealous of his abilities that he slew his own son who might have become a better healer than his father. Diancecht has healed the other gods, as well, fashioning at one time a silver arm to replace one lost, and using a catâ€™s eye to replace a lost eye. He has a magical bath that can instantly and completely heal any mortal or god. Diancecht often uses his powers to enforce his notion that any wound is the responsibility of the inflictor to heal, or at least pay for. In combat, Diancecht will heal himself, friends, and enemies alike, for he is unable to control his penchant for medicine.
Diancecht is obsessed with healing, both among the gods and among mortals. His avatar is forever wandering the world of men searching for those who need his skills. Whenever confronted, Diancecht will seldom involve himself in a situation that does not require him to heal.
He resides in Tir na Og in the Outlands. Erin Darkflame Montgomery of the Sensates is one of his priests.
