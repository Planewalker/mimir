Zargon the Returner, also known as the Devourer of the Depths, was the ancient leader of the Baatorian race. Once he ruled all of Baator, but no more. Too powerful for Asmodeus to destroy after the Baatezu conquest of the Nine Hells, Zargon was banished to a subterranean prison on the Prime Material Plane (on the world of Mystara). There, he destroyed an entire pantheon before the intervention of Asmodeus made him quiescent. He is almost impossible to permamently destroy, regenerating from any injury as long as his horn remains.
More recently, he has awakened again due to the activities of the Cynidicean people, and has been demanding human sacrifices from the Cynidiceans in return for sparing their lives.
Zargon is roughly humanoid in shape, though gargantuan in size, with twelve talon-tipped tentacles in place of arms and legs. His head is reptilian, and his horn is massive and black.
