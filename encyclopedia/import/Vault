The Vault is a secret prison located in Carceri. Prior to the Faction War, it was filled with prisoners brought by the Harmonium and run by the Mercykillers, leaving the Fraternity of Order out of the process. It was considered a place to send those cutters who could easily evade the justice of the Triad system of the Cage. After the Faction war, it is most likely under the control of the Sodkillers, although the Dark of the matter remains just that, dark.
