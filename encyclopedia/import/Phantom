Phantoms are images left behind by particularly strong death traumas. A phantom is like a three-dimensional movie image filmed at the time of death, in the place where it died. 
It can be an image of the death scene, or represent whatever was going on in the victim's head on the time of death. Phantoms are experienced by all senses, but in faded colors.
A few phantoms are evil, created when powerful creatures from the Lower Planes are violently banished from the Material+Plane. These are created deliberately by the fiends in order to deceive or endanger those left behind.
