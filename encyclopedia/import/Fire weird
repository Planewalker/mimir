The beautiful, feminine fire weirds are divinors of hope, nourishment, and love. They are the most empathetic of the elemental+weirds. They favor offerings that embody positive feelings and wishes, such as aged heirlooms, crowns, and preincarnate souls. Their ethics are not like human ones, though, so they care nothing if such gifts are stolen.
