Fortune's Wheel is an opulent tavern, gambling hall, and inn in The Lady's Ward in Sigil, a place where the rich and powerful mingle with rogues and cons. Holding court there is Shemeshka the Marauder, among many others.
The Wheel is named for a massive roulette wheel with terrible odds but a fantastic payoff. Another prominent feature is the carved head of a shadow dragon (judging by its breath weapon), mounted on the wall of the Dragon Bar - the dragon is somehow magically alive, perhaps undead, though rumors claim the wall is an illusion and the dragon is a whole creature, the true owner of the Fortune's Wheel. The inn also boasts a bear-baiting pit and numerous other attractions, including an adjoining inn known as the Azure Iris.
