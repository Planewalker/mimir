A mercurial looks like a human with eyes of liquid gold, silver or
bronze. A mercurial lives in regions of Hyper-reality, whereby
everything is more real, more vital, brighter, stronger and more
intense. It can shed its skin and bones and lives on as a skinless,
boneless humanoid. Every 500 years or so, a mercurial must merge with
its skin and bones to rejuvenate for 24 hours. If it does not, it loses
wish, regeneration and its damage reduction. Most mercurials are
pacifists, refusing to fight even to defend themselves. Sigil knows of
a deviant, evil mercurial called Lathuraz the Mad.
