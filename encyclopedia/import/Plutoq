Plutoq is the Master of Earth and Stone in the pantheon of Maztica. He is pictured as a gigantic Earth Elemental with eyes of jade and long obsidian teeth. He is lord of mountain peaks, obsidian, copper, adobe, dust, jade, turquoise, earthquakes, avalanches, clay,Â  and pottery. He is prayed to for fertile soils, but only when prayers to Watil have gone unanswered.
Plutoq is lawful neutral. He resides in Itzli, a fantastic stone city on one of the cogs of Mechanus.
