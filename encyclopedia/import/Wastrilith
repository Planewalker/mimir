The wastrilith is a water-based demon of Obyrith descent. They appear as scaled, jet black eels with nasty demeanors and huge proportions. They are known for sending minions into battle using their own fearsome might only as a last resort.
A wastrilith is one of the few creatures able to swim the Styx without losing memories. Many serve Dagon.
