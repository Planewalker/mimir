Seamusxanthuszenus is a dust Mephit living in Sigil. Seamus runs a shop called Parts 'n' PiecesÂ  - it used to be a pet store, but now it's a spell component shop because he has an affinity for death (being a dust mephit) and isn't very good about remembering to feed things.
His name is longer than yours is.
