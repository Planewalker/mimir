Grub means food. It's not really a Cant word; it's just regular English/American slang. It also means the larva of some insect. 
A rot grub is a small wormlike creature occasionally found in heaps of offal or dung in dungeons, the Hive Ward, and in the Paraelemental+Plane of Ooze. These small creatures viciously burrow into any living flesh that touches them. The victim must immediately apply flame to the wound or cast a cure disease spell or the rot grub will burrow to the heart and kill its host in 1-3 turns.
