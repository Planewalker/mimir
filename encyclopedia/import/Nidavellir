Nidavellir is the third Layer of Ysgard, a subterranean realm of caves and underground passages. The terrain on this chaotic plane shifts unpredictably, so caverns and byways may open and close.
A realm of magic-savvy dwarves, also called Nidavellir, is located on this layer of the plane; the dwarven+god Muamman Duathal lives there when he's not wandering, and the dwarven goddess Sharindlar has a ring of standing stones nearby. It's possible that Hoder dwells here as well. Svartalfheim is a realm of chaotic neutral dark elves; the goddess </font>Eilistraee</a> dwells there.</p>
Brassberg, the Realm of the draconic god Aasterinian, is found here as well.
