The sixty-seventh layer of the Abyss, the Heaving Hills were discovered by a Guvners known as the Company of the Phoenix. The exact date is unknown, but the discovery happened in the twenty-fourth year of the reign of Factol Zander+the+Explorer.
The Heaving Hills are so named for the earthquakes that constantly roil the landscape, drowning the layer's hills in the surrounding marsh and pushing up news ones to take their place.
The mashy wastes are said to conceal the ruins of the lost cities of the Varrangoin, but the Hills have not hosted flocks of the so-called abyssal bats since their exodus to the Plains of Gallenshu (layer 377th) and Torremor (layer 503rd).
A visitor is more likely to run into the Hezrou that dominate this layer. Those less fortunate may find themselves contending with strange froghemoth-like creatures.

Note: An updated version of the froghemoth appears in "The Champion's Belt," Dungeon Magazine Issue #128 (November 2005).
Note: Fiendish Codex I: Hordes of the Abyss lists the varrangoin as rulers of this layer. However, this runs counter to the meager information already available about it. It is possible that Vis Nirrin Vis (varrangoin warleader) led a campaign to capture the Heaving Hills before confronting the Armanites on the Plains of Gallenshu, but that would be pure speculation.
