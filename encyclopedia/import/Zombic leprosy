This disease originated in Naratyr, the capital city of Thanatos in the Abyss, originally created by a Drow priestess of Kiaransalee. The priestess was rewarded by being transformed into a revenent doomed to spread the plague for all eternity.
The affliction is spread by touch. Symptoms include the loss of sensation in patches of skin which quickly spreads across the body. In 1-4 days damage to nerves nad loss of sensation increase, causing isolated muscle paralysis and bloody, infected patches of skin across the body. These nodules of skin become hard and brittle, then the victim dies, rising as a mindless zombie capable of infecting others with zombic leprosy by touch.
Fiends, celestials, elementals, constructs, incorporeal creatures and the like are immune. The disease is a favorite tool of Rotting Jack.
