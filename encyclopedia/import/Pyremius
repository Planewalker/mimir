Pyremius is the Suel deity of assassins, fire, poison, and murder (see the Oerth+pantheon). Originally simply god of poison and murder, he poisoned Ranet, goddess of fire, stealing her portfolio and adding it to his own.
Pyremius is worshipped by pyromaniacs and assassins, and by jermlaines, firenewts, and grimlocks. 
His symbol is the face of a yagnaloth. His closest allies are Syrul and Mydianchlarus. His Realm in Niflheim is called the Black Volcano.
