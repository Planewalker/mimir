The chronovoid is a common hazard on the Demiplane+of+Time.  They appear as blobs of gelatinous matter that hold a roughly ovoid form.  They are communal organisms, and can split into smaller, independent entities.  Chronovoids have a relationship of some kind with tempsynth, a mold that grows on the "lifelines" of the demiplane.
