Chasme (KAZ-me) are denziens of the Abyss, a greater Tanar'ri. They act as punishers for those who do not fight in the Blood War, rewarding evaders with slow and painful deaths. Due to this war detail, most lesser tanar'ri will attack any chasme on sight.
Chasme look like a disgusting cross between a man and a cranefly.
