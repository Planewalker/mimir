Remnis is god of eagles. His portfolio also includes sky and service. His Realm is in the Beastlands Layer of Krigala; it is called Filchnest. He flies, however, through the planes of Elemental+Air, the Outlands, Mechanus, Limbo, and Elysium.
A lesser god, he is neutral in alignment. He is the mount of many sky gods in human and demihuman pantheons; in exchange, they provide his offspring with isolated, safe places to live. He knows many secrets, which he shares with those he serves. He is on excellent terms with Syranita and Aerdrie Faenya.
His avatar manifests as a gigantic golden eagle with glowing green eyes and a 55' wingspan.
