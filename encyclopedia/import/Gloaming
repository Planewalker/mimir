Gloamings, like shadowswyfts and krinths, are Planetouched with ancestors from the Plane+of+Shadow. Gloamings are pale-skinned humanoids with catlike eyes and dark, furry wings. Their skin is naturally luminescent. They are compulsive travelers and rampant individualists.
Gloamings have a great hatred of drow elves, but illithids generally leave them unprovoked. They feel a deep kinship with and fascination for other planetouched, often calling them cousins. They have a particular affinity with shadowswyfts, though the two impatient races seldom fraternize for long before parting amiably to go their seperate ways. They may be of any alignment, but generally differ from the one that dominates their homelands.
Gloamings are a race of long-lived wanderers and explorers. Though especially common in the Plane of Shadow, they can be found anywhere. 
Gloaming is also the name of a Demiplane created by the Rilmani as a neutral meeting ground.1
