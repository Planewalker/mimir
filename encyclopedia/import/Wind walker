The wind walkers are creatures from the Elemental Plane of Air, where they are servants of the Djinn. Normally they are faintly visable as a coiling mass of writhing serpents, constantly churning out tendrils of wind and losing fragments of themselves. They are telepathic and attack by wind force.
The djinn use them as cloud sculptors. Other creatures retain them to herd rain clouds. The only elementals they willingly associate with are air+elementals. They enjoy strong fragrances.
