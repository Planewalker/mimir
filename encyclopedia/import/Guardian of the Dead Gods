The jackal-headed entity once known as Anubis is now the enigmatic Guardian of the Dead Gods, tasked by the powers or the Multiverse itself to watch over the husks of dead divinities that float in the Astral Plane. Sometimes the Guardian permits beings like Githyanki to build homes on the corpses, while other times it will sternly deal with any who even touch the deceased powers.
The Guardian is served by its Proxy, Betita Khab.
