Ribcage is the Gate-town to Baator, built within the Vale of the Spine, a massive formation that looks for all the world like a spine and ribcage the size of a mountain.  It's rumored to be part of the corpse of an ancient titan or god.
Ribcage is controlled by five powerful powerful families who constantly scheme against one another in an elaborate game of politics. Its leader is Lord Quentill Paracs, a Tiefling, who rules with a council of five senators. Power and politics are the all-consuming goals of just about everyone in the Anthill.
Baatezu are not welcome in Ribcage.
