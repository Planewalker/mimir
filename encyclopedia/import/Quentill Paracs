Lord Quentill Paracs is the mayor of Ribcage. He is a tiefling fighter and spellcaster resembling a squat, hunched, fat old man. He is a master politician with his claws deep in the city and its five controlling families. 
Paracs' greatest fear is to see "his" city stolen by the Baatezu, as they stole the gate-town that preceded Ribcage, Darkspine. Accordingly, he does whatever he can to keep baatezu out of Ribcage, and he is seeking alliances with Excelsior, Tradegate, and other good-leaning burgs in the hope of preventing Ribcage from sliding so far toward law and evil that it ends up in Baator.
