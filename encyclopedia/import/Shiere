Shieres are heavily muscled and elf-like in appearance. They battle for freedom across the planes, helping the oppressed, deceived, and less fortunate. They often act on impulse, but always and tirelessly on the side of good. They display none of the elf-like frailty of the other Eladrin. They can also take a form of a swirling cloud of golden, triangular shards of light.
