The Border Ethereal connects to the Inner Planes and overlaps the Prime Material Plane. From the Border Ethereal a traveler can see a misty greyscale version of the plane from which they are traveling; however, each Plane is only connected to its own Border Ethereal, which means inter-planar travel necessitates entering the Deep Ethereal and then exiting into the destination plane's own Border Ethereal.
