The fourth layer of Carceri, Colothys, is the spiritual home of liars who hurt
others with their falsehoods. It consists of jagged, unforgiving mountains and sudden chasms with little flat ground to find refuge. Crius' Temple, dedicated to the Titan of the same name, can be found here; furthermore, Ellaniath, the realm of the the drow deity Vhaeraun, and the Land of the Hunt, realm of the god Malar, are all located on Colothys.
