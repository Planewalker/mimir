An aberration is a living creature with a bizarre anatomy, strange abilities, an alien mindset, or any combination of the three. They often come from the depths of space, distant times, from worlds that shouldn't or don't quite exist, or from the Far Realm, or they are the result of unnatural hybridization.
Examples of aberrations include illithids, aboleths, Tsochari, psurlons, cloakers, observers, spectators, ethergaunts, Nilshai, Tso, neogi, and dhours.
Gods worshipped by aberrations include Tharizdun, Ghaunadaur, Ilsensine, Mak Thuum Ngatha, Shekinester, Parrafaire, Gzemnid, the Great Mother, and the Neogi Pantheon.
