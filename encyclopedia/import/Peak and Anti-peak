Peak is a timekeeping term used in Sigil. It is equivalent to mid-day, the time of day that the light in the Burg is at its bightest, or its peak. It's opposite, anti-peak is equivalent to midnight, when the night is at its darkest and fartherst away from its brightest. Time in Sigil is counted in hours away from one of these two times. For instance, early afternoon is generall from peak to five-after-peak and night is from six-after-peak until six-before-peak. Late night is three-before-anti-peak until five-after-anti-peak.
