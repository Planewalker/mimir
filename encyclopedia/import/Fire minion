Fire minions are intelligent and cruel elementals sometimes summoned from the Elemental+Plane+of+Fire by the evil god Hiddukel, although some betrayed him to serve Takhisis. Fire minions take a humanoid form, and appear to be composed of both solid matter and living flame. They are, however, able to revert to a less humanoid appearance, such as a fountain of roaring magma, or even shrinkÂ  down into a fire and disappear entirely. Fire minions often choose to take on a demonic appearance, for they realise the terror that this strikes into their mortal foes.
On the Elemental Plane of Fire, fire minions often dwell in mixed-race communities with fire+elementals, Harginn, hell+hounds, fire giants, and many others.
