Astral devas are a type of Deva tasked with bringing justice to the heart of Evil on the Lower Planes. If commanded by the Power they serve, they can enter any layer of any lower plane without passing through the intermediate layers.
Astral devas also commonly travel to the Astral Plane to rescue good beings who have become lost or stranded, and are patrons of planar travelers.
Astral devas have golden skin and amber eyes.
