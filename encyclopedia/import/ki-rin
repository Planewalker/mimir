Ki-rins are good creatures that roam the sky searching for innocents to save and evil creatures to punish. They are golden-scaled equine creatures, each with a single horn like a fantastic combination of stag, horse, unicorn, and gold dragon. Their female counterparts are the T'uen-rin. They worship their god Koriel, and sometimes Aerdrie Faenya.
