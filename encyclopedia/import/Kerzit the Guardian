Kerzit is a fearsome unique Tanar'ri created by more powerful demons to serve the cause of Chaos on the Prime Material Plane. His head is something like that of a wolf, with menacing silver eyes and black-toothed jaws that drool a grayish fluid. He has a pair of long octopus tentacles and a pair of chitinous, almost insectoid arms with serrated edges. He is something like a Glabrezu in overall look.
Kerzit is currently the guardian of the Tome of the Black Heart, a demonic libram owned by Eli Tomorast.
