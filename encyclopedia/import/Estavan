Estavan is an ogre mage and a prominent member of the Planar Trade Consortium. He may be much older than his apparent years. He has never been seen outdoors in Sigil, though he's appeared in Yeoman, seeking to gain more business there. He seeks to expand his mercantile empire at all costs.
He is also a member of the Sigil Advisory Council.
