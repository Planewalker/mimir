Ka’jik’zxi
is the dead+god of creation in the Neogi Pantheon. It created the planes, planets,
Phlogiston, and spheres and made the other five neogi gods to be his
helpers. They poisoned their creator (in the manner a Neogi Great Old One is
poisoned to this day) and it swelled up and exploded. All mortal life
and non-Neogi gods were born from this traumatic birth, according to the myth.
As Ka'jik'zxi is dead, it is currently a corpse floating in the Astral Plane.
