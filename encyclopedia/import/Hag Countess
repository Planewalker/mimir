The Hag Countess of Malbolge, Malagarde or Lamagard, known also as the Hag Queen of the Crushing Lands, appears as an old crippled Night Hag with tattered wings. She carries a flaming sword, and his immensely strong for one who looks so decrepit.
The Hag is ruler of the sixth hell, Malbolge, having taken it from her former consort Moloch.
Latest chant is that she's dead, grown bloated and gigantic and merged with her layer, and that Glasya now rules from a palace made from her skull. Her spawn, the kalabons, live on.
