The zoveri (singular and plural) are a race of aquatic beings who dwell in Lunia, the first Layer of Mount Celestia. They're something like octopus-centaurs, with lower bodies like octopuses and upper bodies like sea-elves or merfolk. If they want, they can grow legs and walk around land for a while, but they always return to the sea.
They're not actually related to centaurs, merfolk, tritons, or bariaurs.
Zoveri are friendly. Really friendly. They make dolphins look like sharks. They make cervidals look like yugoloths. They love everyone, even fiends. Their purpose in life is to be helpful. They spend most of their time patrolling the sea to make sure no one drowns in it. If someone doesn't want their help, they'll help anyway once the Berk's unconscious, quickly administering first aid.
