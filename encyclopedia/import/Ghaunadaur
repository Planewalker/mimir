Ghaunadaur is nominally a member of the Drow Pantheon, but he is primarily worshipped by aboleths, ropers, and other sentient oozes and aberrations.  He is known as "That Which Lurks" and "The Elder Eye."  His holy symbol is an open eye on a purple circle, on a violet circle, on a black circle.
Ghaunadaur dwells in the Paraelemental Plane of Ooze, in a Realm called the Cauldron of Slime. It is a foul mess of ooze and muck, dominated by slimes, oozes, and fungi that light the realm with a phosphorescent glow.
