Tapann the Undying, the Father of the Dance,&nbsp;is a god of korreds, hairy relatives of satyrs. His daughter is Shiallia. He is also called the Horned Dancer and the Horned Leaper.
His Realm is a hill studded with standing stones in Limbo, but he spends much time on the Prime Material Plane. His proxies, Jambul, Hrressek, Tishlun and Bresk, guard the hill in his absence.
