Although many shadow dragons are natives of the Prime Material Underdark, they maintain ties to the Shadow Plane. The shadow walk ability of the ancient shadow  dragons allow many elders of this dragon species to migrate to the plane where they blend in most.
Despite being living creatures, they share an affinity for undeath and negative energy, and often populate their lairs with minor undead servants. Older shadow dragons are skilled arcanists, and most focus on spells from the illusion and necromancy schools.
Shadow dragons commonly worship Faluzure.
