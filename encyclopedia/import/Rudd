Rudd is a demigoddess of luck, skill, and chance native to Oerth. Said to be the daughter of Norebo, she was raised to divinity with the aid of Olidammara. She was imprisoned for a time in the dungeons beneath Castle Greyhawk by the mad wizard Zagyg. 
She often dwells in Brightwater with Lliira, Sharess, Sune, and Tymora, though she has a Realm of her own - the House of Cards in Ysgard's first Layer.
