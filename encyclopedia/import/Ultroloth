The faceless, enigmatic ultroloths are masters of secrets and masters of the Lower Planes. Even the arcanaloths, who are evil geniuses, are mere puppets to them.
Physically, these yugoloths are tall, gray-skinned beings with luminous, disorienting eyes and no other facial features. They typically wear long cloaks that conceal the rest of their bodies.
Ultroloths cannot reproduce their own kind except by promoting exceptional members of the Arcanaloth caste.
