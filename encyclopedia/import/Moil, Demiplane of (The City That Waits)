Long ago, on the material+plane world of  Ranais, there was a city called Moil. When the inhabitants turned from the worship of Orcus, the demon prince cast a magical slumber over them, a curse that could only be broken with the dawning of the sun. Orcus' final trick was to rip the city from the face of the world, turning it into an eternally dark demiplane. 
Orcus never returned to the city, as he was slain by Kiaransalee. The inhabitants died, their dreams becoming an undead horror. Centuries later, the demiplane was found by the demilich Acererak, who reanimated some of the people of Moil to use as undead workers.
