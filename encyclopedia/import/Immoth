Immoths are man-shaped giants made of ice, with horns and poisonous tails. The gemlike clusters of ice on their bodies are actually frozen words, which they can release to create spell-like effects. They avoid Cryonax and the frost+salamander species, and gather at a place called the Mountain of Ultimate Winter, where it is so cold that words and concepts freeze solid.
