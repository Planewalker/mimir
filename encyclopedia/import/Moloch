Moloch was once counted among the Lords of the Nine, for he ruled Malbolge as viceroy to Triel+the+Fallen since the destruction of the Layer's previous liege, known to some as Beherit.
After the+Reckoning, however, Moloch was sold out by his ambitious consort and stripped of his station. Moloch's consort is identified in some sources as Lilith, and in others as the one who would become the Hag Countess. 
All that was many thousands of years ago. In that time, Moloch has been involved in any number of schemes to regain his previous status. He was last seen in a dying world in the Material+Plane just before it sealed itself from all planar travel, though recent reports have him in Avernus.
