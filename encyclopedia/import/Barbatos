Barbatos is the marshal of Maladomini, responsible for all of Baalzebul’s armies on that plane. Authoritarian and a shrewd judge both of his warriors and of tactical problems, he has won Baalzebul’s respect and limited trust. He has never displayed any personal ambitions, nor (at any time) his true feelings, so that among the hierarchy of the hells his loyalty to his master, and therefore his actions in any change of the status quo, remain unknown.
Barbatos appears as a bearded, horned man-like giant with crimson skin, black hooves, and a tail. His eyes are green, and he talks with a rich, persuasive voice.
