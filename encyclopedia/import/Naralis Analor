Naralis is an elven god whose primary interest is not just the safeguarding of elven souls after they depart, but also healing of the living. As Sehanine guides the souls to their time of leaving, he serves Sehanine in making sure they reach their proper destination. He is one of the few death gods who isn’t malevolent or uncaring, and he’s very popular in those worlds  where his worship is practiced. Like Tethrin and Kirith, Naralis has his own refuge in the first Layer of Elysium, called the Healing Glade, where he conducts his godly duties.
