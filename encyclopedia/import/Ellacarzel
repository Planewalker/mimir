Ellacarzel, Lady of the Clouds, is a Movanic deva in the service of Aerdrie Faenya, though she spends much of her time with her lover, the Cloud+King of Arcadia. She has refused Aerdrie's offer to make her a Proxy.
When not in Arcadia, Ellacarzel whispers inspiration to elves on the Material+Plane, often disguised as an cat.
