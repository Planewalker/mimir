Ecalypses are equine creatures that gallop over the Plane+of+Shadow in great herds. They are often used as steeds by those powerful enough to tame them. 
Outside the Plane of Shadow, ecalypses are making their way into Pluton, the third gloom of the Gray Waste, serving proxies of dark powers. These days riding a Nightmare is apparently falling out of style (too many people are doing it), and many lower-planar High-ups are trying to get their hands on an exotic mount with similar capabilities.
