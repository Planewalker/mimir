The Clerk's Ward (known in prehistoric Sigil as the Ward of Masks) is Sigil's center of government and bureaucracy, full of bean-counters, red tape, politicians, advocates, special interest groups, criminals, Jink-launderers, off-duty Harmonium, civil servants, librarians, and patient, boring types. It's the home of the Hall of Speakers and the Hall of Records.
The Clerk's Ward has another side, too: it's where the Civic Festhall is. Their neighborhood is filled with Sensates, artists, painters, restaurants, opera houses, museums, and brothels.
