Planescape: Torment was a computer RPG created by Black Isle Studios. It was released in 1999. It followed the story of a hideously scarred, amnesiac man called the Nameless One, whose greatest enemies were often products of his own forgotten lives. His weird and eclectic cast of allies include a Tiefling thief, the ghost of a past lover, a floating, talking skull, a bodiless suit of armor, a rogue Modron, a Githzerai enslaved to his honor, a reformed Succubus, and a pyromaniac wizard whose body is perpetually on fire. Over the course of the game, players can choose to direct the Nameless One through a variety of different career paths and alignments. The amount of intelligence, wisdom, or charisma they choose to give him dramatically affects the dialog choices.
The game had a rich, involving story with a lot of words in it, most of them written by Planescape designer Colin McComb, great voice talent, and innovative play. It won a lot of awards, but didn't sell a lot of copies. Many people blame the Nameless One's hideous mug on the cover, or all those damned words.
I don't think anyone who's played the game has ever said anything bad about it, though.
