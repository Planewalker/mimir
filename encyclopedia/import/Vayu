Vayu is the Vedic Power of the winds, sometimes gentle and life-giving, sometimes terrible and fierce. He was born of the last breath of Purusa, a primeval giant whom the gods sacrificed to create the earth.
Vayu’s most notable power is the ability to give life to any item. Items that are firmly attached to the ground, such as a flagpole, receive only plant-like intelligence and can do little except grow. Items that can be moved without uprooting the earth, such as a boulder, receive animal intelligence. Only items that previously had the capacity for logical thought, such as a human skeleton, receive sentient abilities. Vayu also has the ability to create cyclones and typhoons. Live beings caught in such winds must save versus breath weapon every other round. Failure indicates that they have been hit by flying debris. Vayu has no form and can only be sensed indirectly, such as when he brushes past one’s skin or whistles through the treetops.
Vayu is a fickle god, bringing moisture and breathing life into the earth one moment, and in the next wreaking terrible destruction with his angry winds. He sometimes shows special restraint when a village pays him the proper worship. 
He resides with Agni and Indra in the Realm of Swarga in Limbo. It is a giant spherical vault filled to the halfway point by a sea of
enchanted milk. Vayu dwells there in a cloud palace, where winds can be as gentle as a feather or as buffeting as a gale. A body who wants to travel to Vayu's home must gain the help of his Asura servants.
