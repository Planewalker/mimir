Hugin ("thought") and Munin ("memory") are two ravens who perch on Odin's shoulder. He uses them as spies and messengers, sending them on various tasks to the far parts of Ysgard and the Prime. He can see through their eyes or speak through their beaks, and often uses them to gather information on particular areas of interest, or to warn his worshipers of impending attacks. They can teleport to or from any location in Ysgard, and are immune to magical control. Omens from Odin are usually delivered by his ravens.
The whole world wide,
every day,
Fly Hugin and Munin;
I worry lest Hugin should fall in flight,
Yet more I fear for Munin.
