The Gray Order is a lawful neutral organization made up of Celestials and Fiends who believe more in advancing the cause of Law than in Good and Evil. It is said to have been founded by an outcast astral+deva and a Cornugon fleeing from the Blood War.
The Gray Order has agents in most large cities, working to moderate both the good of those who follow the ways of Mount Celestia and Arcadia and the evil of Baator and Acheron. In some cities they may work alongside paladins to fight fiends, and in some they may work with fiends to prevent paladins from seizing control.
