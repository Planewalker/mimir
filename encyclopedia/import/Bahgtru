Bahgtru, the Leg-Breaker, is the son of Gruumsh, and he is awesomely strong and awesomely stupid. He is loyal to both his father and Luthic, his mother.
Bahgtru is depicted as a huge, muscular orc with dirty tan skin and green eyes; his tusks are gleaming white from gnawing on bones. Once he fought an enormous, multi-legged monster from another world, and his symbol - a broken thigh-bone - is inspired by this encounter. He would also like a rematch with Bargrivyek.
He dwells in Nishrek in Acheron's first layer, which is also the Realm of Gruumsh, Ilneval, and Luthic. His warriors there live in the Iron Fist and Broken Skull clans.
