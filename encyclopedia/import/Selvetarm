Selvetarm (SELL-veh-TARM), known as the Champion of Lolth, is a god of Drow warriors, spiders, and araneas. He was the son of Vhaeraun and a lost goddess called Zandilar+the+Dancer, who merged with Bast at the time of his birth. 
Selvetarm was not at first evil, and his aunt Eilistraee hoped to turn him toward Good, but Lolth convinced him to slay her rival, the Abyssal+lord Zanassu - when he did, the demonic power merged with his own essence, making him almost as evil as Zanassu had been. 
Selvetarm currently dwells with Lolth, his grandmother, in the Demonweb Pits in the Abyss.
