The dreaded orlythys is a demonic creature native to the Abyss, although they also enjoy the Elemental Plane of Water. Though not Tanar'ri, they are true Abyssal natives, the undisputed lords of a dark and infinitely huge bogland there, where they rule vast empires of slaves forced to serve as laborers, food, and worse.
An orlythys's body consists of a roughly egg-shaped mass of tendrils, tentacles, and sensory organs.
