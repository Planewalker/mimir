The Palace of the Jester[/b] is one of the oldest buildings in Sigil. The last ten thousand years were only one chapter of its existence. 
It's also the largest building in The Cage, sprawling over a good portion of The Lady's Ward.
For long periods of time, however, the Jester's Palace has been empty, a building looked at with fear and superstition and not touched. Its latest occupant is Jeremo the Natterer, the self-proclaimed Lady's Jester. He has made the Palace a place of frequent parties for the movers and shakers of the City of Doors and it serves as the headquarters for the Ring-Givers Faction.
