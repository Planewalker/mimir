Ethereal slayers are carnivorous predators that lie in ambush on the Ethereal Plane, waiting for unwitting creatures to enter. They typically wait in spots that have significant cross-planar traffic. 
A spiny, chitinouos shell armors an ethereal slayer's body, and four mandibles surround its drooling mouth. It has two thick, birdlike legs and two arms that end in wicked four-foot claws like those of a praying mantis. They can often be found in the cities of the Nilshai, employed as guards and raiders.
