Located on Rook Street in the Clerk's Ward (a ways down from the Hall of Records), the Hall of Speakers is the center of law-making and debate for Sigil's government.
Before the Faction War, it was primarily the fifteen factions who met here, and the building doubled as the headquarters of the Sign of One faction. Afterwards, it's been turned into a convention center by Harys Hatchis.
