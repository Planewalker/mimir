Kurtulmak is the chief god of the kobold Pantheon; he is also god of mining, trapmaking, traps, and war. He resembles a large kobold with a stinger at the end of his tail and large horns that curve back from his forehead. Kobold myths say he was granted his divinity by Io.
His Realm in Avernus, Draukari, is a warren of caverns, its tunnels narrow and short-ceilinged. Warped, spectral forests grow on the surface. The twisting tunnels of Draukari are filled with blood and reek of death, and they twist so maddeningly that a body's sure to get lost in them. Anything larger than a halfling has to crawl through the mud, which is filled with traps and other nasty surprises. Garl Glittergold once collapsed the main cavern here as a prank, an act for which Kurtulmak will never forgive him. 
Towns in Draukari include Frekstavik, Nibellin, and Snjarll.
While he is no great threat to the safety of the Hells, various Baatezu archdukes curry his favor as one more ally in the continual power struggle between factions. Kurtulmak smiles graciously, takes any and all aid, and proceeds to rob the archdevils blind while maintaining his front as an ally against other powers.
