Pact magic is practice of summoning vestiges and gaining access to the supernatural abilities they grant.  The process involves drawing a specific seal corresponding to a particular vestige, performing the appropriate ritual (which may or may not involve a special requirement), and making a pact with the Vestige in exchange for its power.  A practitioner of pact magic is called a Binder.
