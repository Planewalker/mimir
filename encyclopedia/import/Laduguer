Laduguer is a evil Power of the duergar, the Underdark-dwelling cousins of dwarves. He is a strict and unforgiving power who demands countless toil. His realm of Hammergrim is located on Acheron. There, he keeps a hall called Forgegloom, its walls made of armor, shields, weapons, and other martial debris. It has no doors or windows unless Laduguer wills it.
Laduguer is considered to be a member-in-exile of the Morndinsamman. He is said to have a daughter, Deep Duerra.
