Lynkhab, according to Xanxost, is both deep depression and intense desire at the same time. She had once personified the idea of Desire so perfectly that she became a disembodied force - Desire itself. But being disembodied Desire left her unable to fulfill her own desires, so she once again took on corporeal form. 
Unfortunately, though she is now capable of having desire she is no longer capable of being Desire - apparently you can only do one or the other. Whenever she transcends corporeality, her powerful desires force her back into solid
form after a day or two. Only by transcending your own desire can you be pure Desire yourself. 
This is why she is both desire and depression. However, she is still a powerful Abyssal lord, capable of reading and feeding off the lusts of others. It suggests that the only way she can transcend her own desires is by dying, but she is too powerful for that. No matter what happens to her body, her passion and will forms a new one. So she wanders the Abyss, hoping to find something powerful enough to destroy her. 
Currently she takes the form of a flame-haired, voluptuous elf with eyes of burning ice, but she can take any form she wishes.
