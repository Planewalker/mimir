Themis, the Titan of Law, is one of the elder titans imprisoned in Carceri by the Olympian gods. 
Themis was the second wife of Zeus, the mother of the Seasons and the Fates, but ultimately Zeus tired of her and banished her with her brothers and sisters. With Mnemosyne, she seeks away to escape while leaving Cronus behind.
