Celestian the Far Wanderer is the god of Stars, Space and Wanderers. A Power primarily worshipped on Oerth, he is also worhipped by Planewalkers in the Planes. He has no Realm as he travels throughout the Astral Plane. He is the brother of Fharlanghn, Oerth's deity of horizons, travel and roads. The two follow similar but differing paths. His smooth skin and his eyes are ebony. He speaks seldom, and then only in a cold and unearthly whisper, which carries well despite its softness. His symbol is a black circle set with seven stars.
