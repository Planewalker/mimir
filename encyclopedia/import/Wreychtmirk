Wreychtmirk is a cube on the Layer of Avalas on Acheron. The Unholy River Styx has a source here, and every visitor sees it differently. The cube's six sides each contain a gate to a different lower+plane, and its life forms mirror the destination. The only town on Wreychtmirk is Mesk, in a rusting valley.
