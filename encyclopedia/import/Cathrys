The second layer of Carceri, Cathrys (also called The Crimson Jungle), is the spiritual home of those who gave in to their animal lusts. It is
a layer of thick jungles and open plains of razored grass. Talona's realm Palace of Poison Tears can be found on Cathrys, as can The Steading, the realm of hill giant deity Grolantor.
