The Demiplane of Time, also called the Temporal Energy Plane and Temporal Prime, is continually in motion. It is a gray windstorm with neither a base nor a top that buffets and overturns travelers who venture within. Everything that enters the plane is tossed and ground against itself until all that remains is more dust - the sands of time carried by the winds to erode new items.
The stormy nature of the Demiplane of Time poses a physical problem, but the greater danger is in the nature of time itself. Those within the sandstorm can be carried months or years into the future, effectively exiling them from their native plane. Several Material+Plane civilizations saw this plane as a convenient prison for unpopular malefactors. But some cultures survived long enough to regret it when their exiles returned centuries after their departureâ€”and had aged only a few days.
The Curtain of Vaporous Color surrounding the Demiplane is translucent with shadowy shapes visible beyond.
Inhabitants include abominations called phanes and elemental-like beings called time+dimensionals. Nearby in the Ethereal Plane grow plants called chronolilies. Princes of the Plane of Time consort with the goddess Istus. Other inhabitants include vortex+spiders, tether+beasts, temporal+stalkers, temporal+gliders, temporal+dogs, and chronovoids.
On the edge of the demiplane, in the Ethereal,  is a fortress called the Castle at the Edge of Time, built by wizard called Aionias the Sapphire Mage.
There is a portal to the Demiplane of Time in Rempha, the City of the Sands of Time in Mertion.
