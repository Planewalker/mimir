Natives of Mount Celestia, hammer archons are powerful celestial creatures with an affinity for the earth, often associated with dwarves, gnomes, and goliaths. They seldom waste time talking.
Hammer archons look like broad, stocky humanoids between 8 and 9 feet in height. Their skin appears to be made of earth and stone.
