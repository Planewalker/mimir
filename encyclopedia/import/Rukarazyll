Rukarazylls are deceivers and tricksters. They disguise themselves as charismatic men and women, creating cults to seemingly benign, but entirely fictitious, deities. Over time, they pervert their followers to the worship of Ogremoch, the Prince of Evil Elemental Earth. They're also found in the service of Zuggtmoy.
In their true forms, rukarazylls are bulbous masses of seething fungal matter, studded with eyes and gasping orifices that leak stinking, black drool. Their heads resemble ram's skulls, and they use snaky tendrils as arms and legs. Their natural voices are thick and gurgling, but they can imitate normal humanoid vocal tones. Rukarazylls can spit acidic ooze at their opponents, among other evil supernatural powers.
