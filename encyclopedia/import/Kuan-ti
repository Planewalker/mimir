Kuan-ti, also known as Huan-ti, is the Chinese Power of fortune telling and war. Instead of making war, however, he tries to prevent it whenever possible. He is a great scholar and protector of the people, though he can be merciless and unforgiving in the pursuit of his duties. When war is unavoidable between two powers, it is his task to adjudicate the dispute and determine who is deserving of victory.
Occasionally, he enjoys using his intellectual prowess to predict the future, which accounts for his position as the god of fortune-telling. In his true form, he appears as a large muscular man with green armor and red skin.
Although he is the god of war, Kuan-ti is not very warlike. Whenever possible, he prefers to see political differences settled by diplomatic rather than military means. When a war does erupt, he prefers to remain involved until he has determined which side is more valorous, for experience has taught him that warriors fighting for just causes tend to be more brave than those fighting on behalf of evil. 
Kuan-ti's Realm of Valorhome lies in Amoria, Elysium's first Layer. A serene air pervades its tree-lined streets. Any disagreements here must be talked out; it's physically impossible to draw a weapon or strike out in anger here. Fires in this realm burn, but do not consume.
