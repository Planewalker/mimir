The Lords of Chaos are the paragons of the slaadi. Unlike many of their equivalents (like Baator's Lords of the Nine) they don't bother to rule their plane. They each seek to spread a different flavor of Chaos across the multiverse. 

Ssendam is the Lord of Madness. She is the oldest of the Lords of Chaos, manifesting as a golden amoeba.
Ygorl is the Lord of Entropy. He manifests as a black slaad or as a winged skeleton carrying a scythe. </p>
Bazim-Gorag is the two-headed Lord of Fire. </p>
Chourst is the Lord of Randomness, manifesting as a white slaad. He once invaded Mechanus.</p>
No one knows what Wartle is the lord of. He's banished anyway, last seen in Mount Celestia of all places.</p>
Rennbuu is the Lord of Colors, appearing as a rainbow-colored slaad with an enormous mane of hair. </p>
