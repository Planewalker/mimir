In the D&amp;D game, Japanese mythology says the divine beings Izanagi and Izanami gave rise to a pantheon of other deities, including the sun goddess Amaterasu.  Amaterasu is the patron of the ruling family of mortals, and the ruling family are considered her descendants, and therefore divine (by law, if not by actuality).
