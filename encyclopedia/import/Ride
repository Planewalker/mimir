Ride is a Cant term for any adventure, task, or undertaking. 
"Traveling to the 366th layer of the Abyss was an interesting ride, but by next challenge will be even greater! Not soiling my trousers!" 
Source: The Planewalker's Handbook, which didn't include the "soiling my trousers" line. That was my fault.
