Rempha, the City of the Sands of Time, is a city in Mertion, the fifth peak of Mount Celestia. It is ruled by a Rogue Modron called Secundus; it's not known if Secundus was, in fact, once a Secundus modron. It shrewdly manipulates the Solar Donathiel, who has been trusted to ensure that no harm befalls the city.
Time flows strangely in Rempha - backward, forward, and sideways. The Archons who dwell here are responsible for watching over fertility, night, day, the constellations, birth, disease, and death. Part of the reason for these strange conditions is the massive gate to the Demiplane+of+Time, which was built by Secundus using parts he took from Mechanus and strange vapors from Mount Celestia itself.
