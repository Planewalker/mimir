The crysmal is a crystalline creature native to the Elemental Plane of Earth and Quasielemental+Plane+of+Mineral. Their 3-foot long, scorpionlike shapes are made entirely of crystals. They have been known to attack in order to gain access to quartz, beryl, corundum, and carbon crystals. Above all else, they seek to perpetuate their kind.
Crysmals live in roving packs with a clearly defined seperation of duties between individuals. These duties are fluid, and individual crysmals may change positions freely. Their leaders are always psions.
Crysmals hate Xorn, who prey on them. They sometimes ally with the Dao, and sometimes tame Chaggrin with their psionic abilities, keeping them as servants.
A close relative, the trilling crysmal, is common near the border with the Positive+Energy+Plane.
