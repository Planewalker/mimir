Nixies are aquatic spirites. Most nixies are slim and comely, with lightly scaled, pale green
skin and dark green hair. Females often twine shells and pearl strings
in their hair and dress in wraps woven from colorful seaweed. Males
wear loincloths of the same materials. Nixies prefer not to leave their
lakes, although some dwell on the Elemental Plane of Water. They worship their goddess, Sarula Iliene.
