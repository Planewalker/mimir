Coeus, son of Gaea and Uranus, is one of the greater titans banished to Carceri by the Olympian gods.
Coeus is the Titan of Fear. A mere glance from him can cause a creature to lose a quarter of his strength. To come within 20 yards is to risk literally dying of fright. Coeus travels only by night.
He often dwells in the court of Cronus in Othrys, but has his own realm in Cathrys, the second Layer of Carceri.
