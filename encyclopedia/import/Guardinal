Guardinals are a race of celestials native to the upper+plane of Elysium. Each guardinal type has a different animal aspect, although the exact ratio of animal and human features varies from individual to individual. Some might have fur or feathers and a rather ordinary, if angelic, human face. Others might have animal muzzles or beaks. Some have very humanoid limbs, others have limbs like those of animals, though most are bipeds.
There are four main types of guardinals:
Innocent guardinals are the cervidals. They are pure and without sin.
Curious guardinals include the tiny mustevals, winged avorals, and wise ursinals. They seek out knowledge in the name of Good.
Warrior guardinals include the fierce lupinals and proud equinals. They seek to eliminate Evil, often venturing into the Lower Planes to kill fiends.
The Leaders are the noble leonals, who merge the lessons of all the other guardinal types within them.
The paragons of the guardinals are Talisid and his Five Companions (the lupinal Duke Lucan, the ursinal Duchess Callisto, the avoral Duke Windheir, the equinal Lord Hwyn, and the cervidal Lord Rhanok).
