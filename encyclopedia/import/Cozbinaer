Cozbinaer, or Cozbi, was consort to Geryon. She was once a
beautiful, unnaturally thin woman with chalk-white skin and
thigh-length pale green hair. Her eyes are fiery green and her long
nails are black. She wears belted robes and jewelry at formal
occasions, but strips these garments away while fighting. Her hooves
are tiny and delicate, easily concealed by boots, and she customarily
wraps her tail around her waist or hangs it over one arm. Her skin is
shaded pink to red on her belly, and red from the hips down, but her
arms and upper torso are chalk-white. Her hair usually hides two tiny
horns that form a crescent above her head, and her canine teeth are
slim, vampire-like fangs.
After Geryon's baninishment, most of Geryon's loyal followers died in
battle with Levistus' followers. Cozbi was horribly hurt in these
conflicts. Preverse sorcery and diabolical engineering keep her alive
long after she should have died from her wounds. Her 9-foot-tall,
white-skinned body is now covered in scars, stitched on skin grafts,
and withered flesh. She spends her time in a glass chamber covered with
tubes funneling a yellow gas that sustains her, though to anyone else
it is deadly poison. When she must leave the chamber, she wears a
complex alchemical suit of armor that contains the same gas.
