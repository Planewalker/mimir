This is a dying Demiplane, its essence bleeding away into the Quasielemental Plane of Lightning, which has been devouring it for eons. 
Anyone with metal armor is drawn to the center of the plane, where they are shocked by arcs of electricity (potentially forever). The only way to escape is by spell or magic item (or by taking off your bloody armor, Berk).
The only known natives are shockers. The plane is mostly the same as the Quasielemental Plane of Lightning. The demiplane's ethereal+curtain is coppery in color.
