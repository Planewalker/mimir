Utukku - Lion-headed scaled fiends that kill all outsiders who
pass through their territory, including others of their kind. Their
lairs in the great ash deserts of Carceri always include impressive
defenses, as each utukku must defend itself from all competitors.
Utukku want no part of the intrigues of other fiends, and prey on any
demons and devils they meet
