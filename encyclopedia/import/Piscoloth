The piscoloths are the sergeants of overseers of the Yugoloth armies. They are cruel and dictatorial and superbly dedicated to torturing and vindicating anything below them. One might think that these cruel oppressors are stupid, yet strangely enough, they are quite intelligent and cunning. These strange creatures look to be a grotesque amalgamation of various species of animals. Their bodies are red and chitinous, like a lobsterâ€™s, and a long fish-like tail sprouts from their backs. Their two legs end in wickedly sharp bird-like talons and their two arms resemble the claws of a crab. Sickly looking tentacles hang from their faces, each one dripping a foul looking fluid. They stand hunched over most of the time and as such are only around 6 feet in height. If they were ever to stand to their full height, they would be around 8 feet tall. Piscoloths weigh around 450 pounds.
