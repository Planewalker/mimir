A company of Baatezu is the “standard” military unit in the Baator, and consists of 333 devils of the specific type in question, organized such that each 10 devils report to a dominant “sergeant” type, or “kohora” as he is called (seldom officially) in the hells, and every 10 of these report in turn to an “akkrabar.” These in turn report to the duke or unique devil in charge of the company (in some cases by means of messenger.
A few companies (the pit+fiends under Hutijin, for example) do not follow this system of ranks, but rather consist of equals (the “companies” of pit fiends under Hutijin are only a tenth as big as those described above, with 33 nobles in each, and it is also thought that Baalzebul’s companies of cornugons are of a third normal strength — that is, with 111 cornugons in each).
Some sages believe that the “least” baatezu (lemures, merregons, nupperibos, and spinagons) must be gathered 666 strong to form a company.
