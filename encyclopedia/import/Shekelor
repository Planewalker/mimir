Shekelor was a wizard who lived in Sigil 10,000 years ago, the most powerful spellcaster of the age. Believing he could defeat the Lady of Pain herself, he ventured into Agathion to retrieve a gem containing the soul of an even more powerful spellcaster who had lived in the City of Doors long before even that distant age.
After many years, Shekelor returned, muttering about spiders and burning from inside his body. He died before a crowd in the City Courts.
