Azor'alq, called the Son of Light and the Banisher of Darkness, is a hero-deity of courage, light, purity, and strength known to the world of Oerth. He is neutral good. Over three thousand years ago, he helped protect the Baklunish royal family during their mythic Hegira. His sword Faruk was forged for him by the ancient elves of Argoria. He is also remembered for his confrontation with the Abyssal lords Munkir and Nekir.
He dwells within the Pinnacles of Azor-alq, in the Dramidj Ocean, with a band of paladins known as the Thousand Immortals. The mortal paladins dedicated to him are called the Sons and Daughters of Light.
