The Ingress Mother is a fat blob of a creature made primarily of hairless, pinkish-gray flesh and served by its horde of mewling children, the Ingress. The dark of the Ingress Mother is that it's a living portal between the layers of Phlegethon and Agathion in Pandemonium. The Ingress will direct their Mother to wherever travelers wish to go in Agathion in exchange for food. They stuff both food and travelers into their Mother's ravenous maw.
