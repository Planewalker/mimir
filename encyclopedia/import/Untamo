Untamo is the Finnish god of dreams and sleep. His Realm in the Outlands is called the Sleeping Lands. This lesser god remains in his realm most of the time, rarely venturing beyond the borders of his domain. He dislikes being disturbed, and those who enter his realm fall instantly asleep, to awaken only when the god wills it. Surprisingly, the Sleeping Lands are are adjacent to the noisy, clattering realm of Tvashtri.
