Volispula, the Flensed Marquesse, is the Abyssal+lord of finery and ostentatious ceremony, as well as ruler of the eighth layer of the Abyss, called the Skin-Shedder.
The Skin-Shedder slowly corrupts the alignment of any creature that dwells there, shifting it to evil and chaos over the course of a few days. Tieflings are immune.
