Apshai is god of insects in the Egyptian Pantheon, appearing as a great praying mantis, able to shapechange at will and call down plagues of vermin on puny mortals.
Apshai's priests wear yellow kilts. The holy day for the faith is the spring equinox. Apshai appreciates the sacrifice of animals in its name.
Apshai's Realm, called simply The Hive, is in the Outlands. It is a huge tower crawling with ants, and the tunnels below are said to lead to every Prime+Material world where the Egyptian Pantheon is revered.
