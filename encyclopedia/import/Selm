Selm is a baatezu+noble whose title is Prince of Possessors, the fiends of possession known also as Mezzikim. At one time there stood beneath him a council of six lesser nobles - Thyle, Cykes, Tyd, Nausyyd, Dyclex, and Hyrkovan - but since an ancient rebellion in Baator, his six inferiors have allied with one another, gradually assuming much of Selm's power. Selm's place is now a merely nominal one, though officially he is still the chief, and only he receives orders from Asmodeus. This is a potentially explosive situation, so both sides remain on their guard.
Selm stands seven feet in height, his heavily armored hide seeming to be formed of colorful leaves of dangerously alluring beauty. His eyes can petrify at will, and massive spikes protrude from his arms. A small disk embedded in his chest prevents any fiends of possession from harming him.
