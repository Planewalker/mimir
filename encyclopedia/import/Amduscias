Amduscias is a baatezu+noble in Avernus, leading 29 companies of Abishai. Although he is a Baatezu, he serves Tiamat like his fellow duke Malphas and the pit fiend Goap.
Amduscias has many forms, from a dirty yellow unicorn with eyes of flame to a hawk-headed man in dark red or black horns. His favored form is a wolf with a prehensile, constricting serpent's tail. 
He is called the "Reconciliator of Foes," and is often employed by Tiamat to mediate in disputes with the baatezu hierarchy.
