Kr’tx is a lesser deity of the Neogi Pantheon favored by umber hulk slaves, who delight in brutality and wanton
destruction. The favor of Kr’tx is always demanded before a major
battle. Kr’tx is seen as a red neogi with continually burning claws and
hair.
Kr'tx dwells in the Gray Waste, which the neogi call Jik'qu.
