For the Baatezu military unit, see company.
This group of Guvners is credited with discovering the sixty-seventh layer of the Abyss. An exact date is not known, but it is certain that the Company visited the Heaving Hills in the twenty-fourth year of the reign of Factol Zander+the+Explorer.
Whether the Company is related to the worshipers of the Phoenix-deity who lies beneath Howler's Crag is likewise unknown.
