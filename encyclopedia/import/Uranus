Uranus was the early pre-Titan Power, ruler of the heavens and Gaea’s husband. He was horrified by the hideousness of his offspring with Gaea - the Titans, Cyclopes and Hecatoncheires. He shut them up inside their mother Gaea, in the plane of Carceri, which both pained and angered her. To avenge herself and her children, she persuaded one of the children, the Titan Cronus, to attack Uranus. The Furies and the Giants were born when Uranus’ blood fell on the earth, and the goddess of beauty, Aphrodite, rose out the sea-foam where it mixed with his blood. What happen to Uranus after the attack is unclear, but he may still be watching the earth from a secret hiding place.
Uranus is a bitter old god in hiding from his progeny, who do not even realize that he is alive. He delights in causing harm to Gaea and spoiling machinations of the Olympian powers. He will always send his avatar to hinder any attempt to free the Titans or reach site of their imprisonment, Carceri.
Omens and portents from Uranus are so subtle as to go almost unnoticed, for he is quite fearful of revealing his presence. Still, the especially wise or astute may detect his in unusual events in the heavens.
