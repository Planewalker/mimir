Halflings also worship very specialized minor deities or "small gods." Each halfling household has a god of its hearth, usually based on one of the clan matriarchs. The founder of the community will often be treated as the god of the halfling village generations after his or her death. The halflings also revere their legendary heroes.
Other published examples include:

The god of baking.


The god of fishing (pictured as an ancient and scarred trout).


The god of the local woods (pictured as a hare or fox).


Angwa, the Cave of Whispers. Angwa is both a god and a cave on top of a mountain, used by the local halflings to bury their dead. Angwa can be persuaded to grant miracles if the halflings apologize at length for the time they've spent not visiting, and entertain him with tales. He communicates through the dreams of those who sleep in the cave entrance. Angwa was described briefly in Dragon #293.
