Ustisha Cambris of the Builders’ Fellowship (NG male human Ftr3 Fated) –
Ustisha has the support of many of the guilds, and along with councilwoman Merem is responsible for all of the established guilds, and most of the new guilds, publically supporting the council. He has been deftly wielding his current position on the Sigil Advisory Council to lower the city tariffs levied against the importation of building materials within Sigil, and has fallen into agreement with Councilman Estavan on this matter.
