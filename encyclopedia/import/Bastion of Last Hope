For the goddess of cats, see Bast.
The Bastion of Last Hope is a fortress made of black igneous rock squats in a mountain range of Othrys in Carceri. The ambient, reddish light of the plane lends the Bastion a brooding air of menace. Only one entrance offers itself, and those entering can't help but notice that the entrance strongly resembles the maw of some massive demonic toad. No one person rules the Bastion. Instead, it serves as a sort of headquarters for the Revolutionary League, happy in their apparent victory over the other Factions in Sigil's Faction War. Here a Planewalker can obtain all manner of forged documents, surgical alterations to aid a permanent disguise, and various other nefarious goods and services. It is a good place to find assassins, spies, and others of ill repute. But Canny travelers remember that they're on a plane full of traitors, so they trust no one within the Bastion's walls.
