Everyone's got a theory. The Guvners say that Law makes the Great Wheel go round, the Xaositects say its Chaos, the Doomguard says it entropy, the Bleakers say it's madness, the Dustmen say it's death, the Fated believe it's guts and determination, the Incantifers think it's magic, and the Signers think it's their own imaginations. 
The Merkhants say Bar that, the thing that makes the planes turn is Jink, money, Reflected-Sound-as-of-Small-Relatives-of-Dwarves. Economics. 
The Merkhants are a loose group of planar merchants, moneylenders, investors, and entrepeneurs dedicated to making sure the societies of the planes stay friendly to what keeps them healthy - making sure their markets stay open, or opening those markets that stubbornly remain closed out of xenophobia or misguided ideals. Many give them the nickname "Misers," but they know that a rising tide lifts all boats; they're just determined to make sure they're the first ones in the surf, is all.
Everyone needs money and trade, especially on the wide, often hostile planes of existence, most of which weren't built with mortals in mind - many places, like Sigil, would quickly die if it weren't for goods from elsewhere. Even immortals can benefit from trade, though - trade in souls, trade in belief. But all those things can be converted into currency, since there's nothing jink won't buy. Nothing at all. The ones who control the economies of the planes control everything.
The Merkhants are based around the Gate-town of Tradegate. They don't admit anyone into their Sect that hasn't already amassed a significant amount of wealth; they're not a charity, Berk. They're a group of like-minded individuals with a mutual interest in greasing the planes' economic wheels.
