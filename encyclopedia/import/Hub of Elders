The Hub of Elders is a group of several hundred special inevitables who spend their time peering throughout the Multiverse looking for broken laws they determine deserve punishment. They magically encode instructions on newly created inevitables of every caste.
Each Cr√©che-forge has its own Hub of Elders, so there may be thousands of these groups.
