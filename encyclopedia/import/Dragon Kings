The four Dragon Kings, Ao Ch'in, Ao Kuang, Ao Jun, and Ao Shun, are the rulers of the four seas. Each dwells in a magnificent crystal palace beneath his respective sea. Each has a cabinet of ministers made up of the paragons of each aquatic animal species and an army of fish, crabs, and crayfish.
The Dragon Kings are also responsible for bringing rain to the lands adjoining their seas, and oversea the chiang lung, or river dragons.
The Dragon Kings are huge, serpent-bodied lung dragons, but can take the form of men or women. They are of demigod status, and live in the Prime Material Plane.
