Tamara is the draconic goddess of mercy. She is the mate of Lendys, and strives to temper his justice with her forgiveness. She seeks to preserve life and happiness, but believes that death can sometimes be a mercy to those who are critically ill or wounded.
She dwells in Elysium. She manifests herself as a huge, wingless dragon of a burnished platinum color. Some myths claim she is the mother of Bahamut.
