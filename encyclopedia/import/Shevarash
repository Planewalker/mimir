Shevarash, the Black Archer, is a minor god of the Seldarine embodying vengeance at all costs and hatred of the drow. He was born about 6000 years ago and vowed an eternal vendetta against the dark elves after they slaughtered his family. After a lifetime of crusades, he was granted divinity by Fenmarel Mestarine.
Shevarash carries five weapons: in his aspect as the hero Elikarashe he wields the spear Shama, which can speak to elf warriors of pure heart, the sling Ukava, which never misses, and the club Maelat, which can only be wielded in defense of his people. As Shevarash the Night Hunter he carries the Black Bow, which slays any drow it hits, and the sword Traitorbane.
Shevarash splits his time, spending part of it in Arvandor with the Seldarine and part of it in Limbo in Fenmarel's Realm Fennimar.
