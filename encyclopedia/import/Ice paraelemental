For the most part resembling walking ice sculptures, ice paraelementals are natives of - you guessed it - the Paraelemental+Plane+of+Ice. Many obey the will of Cryonax, more out of fear than respect. Others resist the archomental's domination, hiding in out-of-the-way communities in the frozen heart of the plane or simply ignoring him.
Ice paraelementals are organized into kingdoms ruled by numerous minor lords and nobles. They tend to be unfriendly, but they get along well with the mephits associated with their paraelement, dwelling with them in joint cities and realms.
