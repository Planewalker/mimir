Laogzed is a vile god worshipped by troglodytes. It resembles an oozing, acidic, reptilian being with toadlike features and patches of dead flesh. It devours anything it can cram into its slavering maw to sustain the stinking body it drags about, but it prefers food with that bleeds and wriggles. It is said to be the offspring of a reptilian Tanar'ri female; its father is thought to be Tharizdun or Panzuriel.
He dwells on the 181st Layer of the+Abyss, called the Rotting Plain.
