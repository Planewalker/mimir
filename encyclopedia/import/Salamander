Salamanders are natives of the Plane+of+Fire. They're serpentine creatures with coppery skins and fiery red hair. The males have flaming beards and mustaches as well. Long antlers extend from their humanoid heads, and their eyes glow yellow or green. 
Salamanders hatch from eggs, which hatch into wormlike larvae. Mature salamanders have three castes: the lowly flamebrothers serve the common salamanders, who serve the mighty nobles of their race.
Salamanders live in iron cities ruled by their nobles. They keep themselves independent from the schemes of the efreet and the designs of Imix. One of their kings is known as Searazul.
Salamanders worship the god Kaelthiere.
