The lush dining room of Chirper's, in the Market Ward, is alive with the noise of its client√®le, the music of its entertainment, and the chatter of its birds. Large, transparent bubbles fill the room, each holding a different bizarre specimen belonging to the Multiverse's bestiary. Eyewings flitter about in one bubble, dropping tears of acid. A pair of Xorn are in another. Cages of birds litter the room's ceiling as well, the inhabitants each singing their own unique songs. Primes and planars alike sit and drink together, and a gnomish string quartet makes the stage a gala of happy Bytopian music.
