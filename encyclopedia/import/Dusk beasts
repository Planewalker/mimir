The two-headed lizard ephemera called dusk beasts are native to the Plane+of+Shadow, but often found on the Prime Material Plane as well. An ancient crone calling herself Miasma, who is rumored to be a Night Hag, breeds and occasionally sells dusk beasts in Pandemonium. She parts sorrowfully with each cub and charges heavily, not always in Jink.
