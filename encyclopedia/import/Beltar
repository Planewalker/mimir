Beltar, a Suel goddess of Oerth, is a lesser deity, patron of deep caves, pits, and malice. She is chaotic evil in alignment, with chaotic neutral tendencies. She appears in many forms, including a beholder, a red dragon, a withered crone, and a Marilith. Her Realm is in Carceri.
She was once goddess of mines and earth, but was supplanted by other deities, including Moradin, Garl Glittergold, Jascar (who took the form of a winged horse while he battled her), and Fortubo. She is mostly worshiped by savage humans and subterranean nonhumans. She hates most everything.
