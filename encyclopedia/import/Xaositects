The Xaositects (or Xaosmen, Chaosfolk[/b], etc., as you like it) are truly loose cannons. What they're going to do next is never known, if only for the premise on which their faction is based: the Multiverse is chaos. [/b]Ch[/b]a[/b]o[/b]s[/b]. [/b]Nothing makes sense. There is nothing that can bring order to the chaos that exists everywhere, there is no way to herd the glory of X[/b]o[/b]As [/b]into ranks and files. Chaos is beautiful. Chaos is glorious. Chaos is


perfect in its disorder. The Xaositects usually wear colorful clothes, walk around speaking perfect gibberish, and then cheerfully break any roles assigned to them, including ones already defi[/b]ned in this sentence. When given a choice between two things, they'll do a third. When they are expected to do one thing, they will do the opposite. It's chaos.
