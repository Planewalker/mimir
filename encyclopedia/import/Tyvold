Tyvold is the Factol of the Bleakers. He's a gray elf, and he's pretty gray in all other respects as well. Comes with the territory, one could say.
Before he became factol, he was in charge of the Orphanage and Insane Asylum wing of the Gatehouse, which some think was the easiest job there. His cousin is Tessali, who has the more difficult job of watching over the Criminally and Irretrievably Insane wing.
