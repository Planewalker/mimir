Idun is the Norse Power of spring. She is married to Bragi, the god of poetry and song. Idun is also the goddess of youth, and the keeper of the golden apples which keep the gods of Asgard young. The body of anyone eating one of these apples becomes 10 years younger. Of course, Idun and her apples are coveted by races other than the Aesir, and the giants are constantly trying to kidnap her. Idun has the power to slow or reverse the aging process in any being, or to awaken any dormant or sleeping thing. In her true form, she is a youthful woman of great beauty.
Idun is a cheerful and friendly goddess who takes great delight in seeing things grow and remain healthy. She is extremely conscientious about making sure that every god eats one of her apples every ten years. Idun is especially protective of young girls, and there is a chance that she will send her avatar to protect one who is in danger.
She takes turns guarding the Orchard of Immortality with Shou Hsing of the Chinese pantheon. She has a simple house in Asgard, though she visits her husband in HarpHearth from time to time.
