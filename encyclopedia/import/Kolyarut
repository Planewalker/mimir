The weakest of the inevitables, kolyaruts are
fugitive-hunters, the ultimate enforcers of contracts. They come from
Mechanus to punish those who willingly break oaths and bargains.
Before beginning a mission against a deal-breaker, a kolyarut learns
 as much about the contract or oath as possible. It’s not interested in
 those who break deals accidentally or against their will— only those who
 willingly break contracts violate the principle that kolyaruts are created
 to uphold. If a written contract was broken, the kolyarut typically carries
 a copy of the contract with it.
Kolyaruts are the most talkative of the inevitables, making credible
 attempts at social niceties such as proper greetings before getting down
 to the matter at hand. They can use disguise self to appear as almost
 any kind of humanoid — useful if they need to go undercover to catch their
 quarry.
When not disguised, kolyaruts look like clockwork humanoids in flowing red robes and golden armor.
