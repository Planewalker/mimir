Lammasus (LAM-uh-sooz) are noble creatures that care for the well-being of all creatures. They usually dwell in old, abandoned temples and ruins located in remote areas, although some are civic leaders such as Lebes of Heart's Faith. They have a golden brown lions body, wings of an eagle, and the face of a humanoid. There are three kinds of lammasu: the standard lammasus that generally dwell on the Prime Material Plane, the greater lammasus that lead the standard lammasus and have priestly magic, and the celestial lammasus who dwell on the Upper Planes, are highly intelligent and also have priestly magic.
