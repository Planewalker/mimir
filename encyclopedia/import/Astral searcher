Astral searchers[/b] are mindless shells of nebulous human shape created by traumatized thoughts in the Astral Plane. They wait at color+pools and other astral rips and tears, looking for material bodies to posess. Until they find a body to inhabit, they have no real life or existence, but afterwards they soon relearn the skills known by their bodies (but not their memories) and roam the planes intent on recreating whatever thoughts led to their creation. One created by fear, for example, seeks to create more fear.
