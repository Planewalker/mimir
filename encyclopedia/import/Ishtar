Ishtar, a goddess of the Babylonian Pantheon, is neutral in alignment, the Power of love and war. Her realm, the City of the Star, is in Amoria, Elysium's first Layer. Her realm is made of white marble and exquisite desire, shaped like a five-pointed star. It's said to be one of the most beautiful places in the Multiverse.
Ishtar always manifests as a beautiful woman with the strength of a titan. She was born from an earlier goddess, Inanna (of the Sumerian Pantheon). She has to watch her lover, Tammuz, die every year.
