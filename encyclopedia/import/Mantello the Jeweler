Mantello the Jeweler, formally the hatchetman and suspected consort of Shemeshka the Marauder, is a Githzerai Zerth. He gave Shemeshka the laugh when he joined the Fated, who are too powerful for even the King of the Cross-Trade to risk the wrath of at the moment. Mantello's long been suspected of stealing magic items and somehow changing their form while keeping their enchantments intact, but no one's caught him in the act or figured out how he did it.
