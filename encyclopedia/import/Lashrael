Lashrael is a Solar in the service of Corellon Larethian. He/she speaks with great conviction and (depending on the message) great joy or sorrow. In battle, Lashrael is ferocious, neither asking nor giving quarter. 
Lashrael, like his/her brother/sister Felarathael, is greatly revered by the elves, held by some to be a demipower in his/her own right. Both resemble tall, shining, androgynous elves in gleaming white robes.
