The small, coal-black, humanoid-shaped emberlings are natives of the Elemental+Plane+of+Fire. Powerfully psionic, their eyes burn with white flame, somewhere between ferocity and serenity. They dwell with other fiery creatures in small communities, spending most of their time contemplating the flames of their home. They are quick to anger but equally quick to forgive. They delight in contests of body and mind.
