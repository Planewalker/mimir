Magic is a very important part of elven life, and while Corellon Larethian holds magic to be part of his portfolio, other elven gods lay claim to more specific forms of magic. Kirith Sotheril is one such deity whose portfolio concerns magic, in this case divinations and enchantments. She and Sehahine+Moonbow are rivals of a sort, since in many worlds Sehahine considers herself to be the patroness of the subtler forms of magic, but they’re far from enemies.</p>
Kirith dwells in Elysium with the demigod Tethrin Veraldé, whom the stories consistently portray as her lover (the truth of this is unknown). [/b]Their Realm there in Amoria is called Tethridar.Sources:[/b] Dragon magazine #155 - "The Elfin Gods", Dragon magazine #236 - "The Seldarine [/b]Revisited"[/b]
