Dalt is a lesser deity, almost forgotten on the world of Oerth but slowly gaining more followers. He is god of doors, enclosures, locks, keys, and Portals. The brother of Vatun, he seeks to free his sibling from his magical prison and he's understandably peeved at Telchur. 
Dalt is chaotic good. He takes the form of a wild-haired old man or a young red-haired thief. 
He wanders the Outlands, having no permanent Realm of his own.
