Hachiman is a member of the Japanese Pantheon.  He was once a mortal named Ojin but was made immortal and elevated to the position of god of war by Ama-Tsu-Kami.  His holy symbol is the katana, and his realm is called Kenyama.
Kenyama, which he shares with O-Kuni-Nushi, is a realm of war and heroes, constant struggle and preparation. Kenyama is built on a bit of flying rock the two gods can steer between the larger rivers of earth on the first Layer of Ysgard (though it's usually only a short distance from Asgard). 
Hachiman is particularly suited to Ysgard, and his Petitioners can match those of the Norse Pantheon blow for blow. A warrior who can't swing a sword isn't welcome there. The two gods sometimes wander over and into the realms of other powers. Hachiman is a firm friend of Clangeddin Silverbeard.
