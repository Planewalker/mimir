The Furies, also called Erinyes (but not to be confused with the Baatezu of the same name), were born when the blood of Uranus, spilled by Cronus, fell upon the earth. They are angry and avenging deities who hunt down wrongdoers and punish foul deeds. They are also known by their individual names, Alecto (the persevering anger), Tisiphone (the blood avenger), and Megarea (the jealous). The Furies reside in the Gray Waste and only come forth (always together) to fulfill curses or punish terrible crimes, especially those involving oneâ€™s own family. They have the power to fly, and to find their quarry no matter where he hides (as long as he is not hidden by some divine means). In their true forms, the Furies are old, winged crones carrying whips and scourges. 
They are part of Olympian mythology.
