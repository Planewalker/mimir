Nuada of the Silver Hand was the chieftain of the Celtic Pantheon in its early wars against the Fomorians. Because his hand was severed, he had to step down from the position of leadership.
Chant is that Nuada's looking for a worthy successor, and when he finds one he'll move on to the next stage of existence, becoming whatever is beyond a greater god.
He continues to keep a realm in Tir na Og in the Outlands, which he calls Mag Tuireadh, the Plain of Pillars. He has no proxies or Petitioners, because every one of his worthy petitioners that enters his realm is absorbed by their god immediately.
