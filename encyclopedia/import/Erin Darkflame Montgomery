Erin Montgomery was the Factol of the Sensates pre-Faction War, and one of the most popular people in Sigil. She led the Sensates away from their more hedonistic practices, and encouraged the pursuit of cerebral experiences like art and music.
She believed that everything should be experienced, but she looked at the big picture. If enough people experience enough of the multiverse, they'll realize the grand truth and finally "ascend" into a state of sheer consciousness, leaving their senses behind them once more knowledge is useless.
