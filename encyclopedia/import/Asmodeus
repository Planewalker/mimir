Asmodeus is one of the many names given to the Dark Lord of Nessus, the overlord of Baator, greatest and most mysterious of the Lords of the Nine.
Nothing is known for sure of the Overlord. There are whispers of the Dark One's symbol of office, the ruby rod, and of his most trusted servant, Alastor the Grim. There are even cults dedicated to worshipping him. But the Dark Lord is the Father of Lies, and it could all be a Peel. The scholar Willgan the Dogged learned more of the Dark Lord's true nature than anyone had before, and shortly thereafter he imploded, leaving a splatter of blood the only legacy of his research.
