Ruornil, known as the Moon God and the Silver Prince, is the god of night, moon, and magic in the Cerilian Pantheon. He is distant and mysterious, leaving no written word for his followers, more a patron of sorcery than wizardry. He is allied with Avani, who is more a patron of wizardry than sorcery, and married to Sera, goddess of wealth, who looks after the physical as he looks after the spiritual. Their daughter is Elo√©le, goddess of night and thieves.
Ruornil's Realm, the Silver Lands, is in the Outlands. His petitioners devote eternity to studying the true mysteries of the Multiverse by the light of a silver moon.
