Qirtaia is a Djinni slaver who specializes in procuring thralls with advanced and highly specialized skill sets. In his flying ship Kanto's Lament, he travels throughout the Inner Planes and Outer Planes, avoiding only the Elemental Plane of Air, where his occupation makes him unwelcome among his own people.
The djinni ensnares what he calls his "flesh-tools" with his magic - he is an accomplished sorcerer. He is a committed pacifist of sorts, and will flee rather than fight.
