A Parai (plural: paraii) is a native of Mechanus. They resemble female figures wearing tight black leather dresses, but their faces are hollow porcelain masks. In the hollow of their steel-haired heads is a ball of white or pale yellow light, the truly sentient part of the parai, the part that animates the rest.
Paraii are obsessed with perfection, and they have the power to drain beauty from those they encounter and incorporate into their race. All paraii are equal, all are connected. They reproduce by posessing victims of exceptional beauty, strength, or intelligence and transforming them into more of their kind.
They are also known as visilights.
