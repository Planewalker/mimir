Zimimar is the Minister of Morale in the Dark Eight, in charge of propaganda,
misinformation, quelling rebellions and insurrections, and making sure
every Baatezu warrior has high spirits - or else. She has a network of
spies to ensure that information is tightly controlled, and that no
"bad eggs" go unpunished.
