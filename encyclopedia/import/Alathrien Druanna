Alathrien is a nearly-forgotten member of the elven Pantheon. She resides in the Outlands in a sky-blue fortification known as the Spiral Castle, protected by a large maze of thorns. In earlier times she watched over summonings that brought forth friends and allies of the elves to their aid, but now most elves seeking such assistance call upon Corellon Larethian instead. Alathrien now devotes her time to strengthening her reputation among those wizards known as runecasters. Because of her position, Alathrien has relatively few enemies but has attracted the attention of two other powers, Malyk (Talos) and Velsharoon. These two seek to elevate themselves at the Seldarine's expense and so have choÂ­sen her as their first target (neither one knowing they're seeking the same deity). To date, however, their efforts have failed.
