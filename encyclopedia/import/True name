True names is an arcane concept that believes every being has one, true name that describes their being. The knowledge of others' true names is said to give power over that individual. The use of true names is a necessary component in some very High-up binding and enchantment magics. 
It is said that even powers have true names.
The concept is not deeply explored in Planescape, but some spells involve them. Word Archons and Logokrons are beings closely tied to the use of truenames.
