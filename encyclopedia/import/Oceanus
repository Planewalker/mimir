Oceanus is a Titan imprisoned by the Olympian gods. He often comes to the court of his brother Cronus in Othrys, but maintains his own Realm in the icy seas of Porphatus, where he keeps a half-sunken temple to himself. He is chaotic evil. His wife is Tethys, and he is the father of Tyche and the other Oceanids.
This titan always has a green shimmer around his body. He is able to raise winds of hurricane force with a gesture, and create massive waves wherever there is water. All creatures of water of less than divine status must obey his commands, although Poseidon outranks him on the Prime Material Plane since the greater titans were defeated.
