Varrdigs, or fluid brutes, are grues native to the Elemental Plane of Water. They may appear as pools of water, as fountains, or as part of a greater body of water tinged slightly with green. Their default form is a globular, transluscent jelly-like blob with a lower fringe of small, clawed legs and disgusting intestinal protrusions to provide jet propulsion. They attack with jets of fluid from these protrusions, stunning, blinding, or drowning their opponents, or by ramming with their heavy saclike bodies.
Varrdigs usually travel in packs of three, the three companions fusing together into a gestalt form, looking something like a snowman made from watery stomachs. Varrdigg fusion may be a religious sacrament as well as a defensive and hunting strategy; varrdig triads defend their territories from all others.
Vardiggs are scavengers, primarily feeding on weak, diseased, or elderly beings on their plane. They are exterminated by marids whenever they meet them, but they are on good terms with most other water elemental races, as well as ixitxachitl and sahuagin. When killed, they leave behind a Spell object that contains a single spell suitable for copying into a spellbook.A vardigg can be summoned with a summon monster IV spell.
