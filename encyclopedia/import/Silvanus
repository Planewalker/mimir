In the deepest reaches of Tir na Og is the realm of Summeroak, where the vegetation grows thick and feral, the canopy of leaves so dense that it seems all light must surely be blotted out. Here grow the greatest of all trees, and here the Power Silvanus (sihl-vann-us), the Forest Father, calls home.
A deity of nature, Silvanus was much invoked in inscriptions found in
Gaul and Britain, and seems to have power over the hunt and all
activities that take place in a "sylvan" setting. The name is Latin,
and although there is no doubt that the deity himself is Celtic, we
have no trace of a Celtic name. Some graybeards have suggested that
Silvanus is the same as Cernunnos - "the horned one" - whose name was held by some
Celts as too holy to pronounce. Like Cernunnos, Silvanus is primarily concerned with the balance of nature above all other things.
Like Oghma, Silvanus has also become part of the Faerunian pantheon; Celtic gods are nothing if not adaptable. Silvanus is closely allied with Chauntea and is served directly and indirectly by Eldath, Mielikki, Gwaeron Windstrom, Lurue, and Shiallia. He is bitterly opposed to Malar and hates both Talos and Talona.
