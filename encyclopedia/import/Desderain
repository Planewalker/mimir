There is only one glimmer of hope in the infinite layers of the Abyss, the Desderain. These cutters are a network of freedom fighters, who attempt to bring lost souls out of the Infinite Pit. They attempt to thwart the Tanar'ri every chance they get, choosing to opposethis unstoppable evil. To do this, these bashers use powerful spells of illusion and other magical aids that allows them to survive in this inhospitable plane. Not surprisingly, Desderain members are immediately slain by tanar'ri once they're identified.
Some say that these madmen, who carry their cold-forged iron weapons in secret, are actually a front for some ascending Fiend, using the guise of freedom to destroy its enemies.
