Krinths[/b] are, like shadowswyfts and gloamings, Planetouched from the Plane+of+Shadow. Their ancestors were shadow+demons, shades, and humans descended from Netherese migrants from the world of Toril. They have straight black hair, black eyes, and dusky gray skin. They live a little longer than humans. 
Krinths are mostly slaves of the shades who rule their cities, though they are more valued than many other slaves. Like shadowswyfts, krinths tend toward chaos and have an impetuous nature, although krinths also take toward their demonic side and tend toward evil.
