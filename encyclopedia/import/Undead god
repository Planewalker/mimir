The only undead god on record was Tenebrous, formally known as Orcus. 
There are many gods of the undead, such as Kyuss, Camazotz, Falazure, Hecate, Jergal, Kiaransalee, Shargaas, Afflux, Evening Glory, Osiris, Yeenoghu, and Chemosh.
There are also a number of undead beings who have acheived divinity, such as Vecna, Kanchelsis, Velsharoon, Doresain, and Mellifleur.
But Tenebrous is the only being who died as a god and was then reanimated by negative energies in the way mortal undead are.
