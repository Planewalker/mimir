"A figure grew distinct in front of him, as if the whiteness were nothing but a clearing fog. It was a man in a brown cloak, hood throne back, with fair skin, large brown eyes, and brown hair. A bright green strip of material, some kind of cloth, coiled many times around his body without actually touching him. It enclosed him from head to toe in one long serpentine spiral that turned slowly, hypnotically. Beneath his cloak, the man wore a tunic, loose pants, and leather boots, all brown. In his right hand, he clutched a short sword. The man looked exactly like Thane, though he seemed blurry, soft at the edges. Within the spiraling strip, he flickered into and out of existence like a dwindling flame."
