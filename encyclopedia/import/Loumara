Loumaras are a form of demon separate from the races of Tanar'ri and obyriths.  They're created spontaneously from the Dreaming Gulf, the 430th Layer of the+Abyss, where the cast-off dreams of a pantheon of dead gods turn slowly into incorporeal demons as the Abyss itself digests them.
Kinds of loumaras include guecubus, manitous, caligrostos, and dybbuks. One of their lords (possibly their only lord) is Sifkhu.
