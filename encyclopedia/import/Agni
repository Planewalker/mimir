Agni is the Vedic Power of fire, condemned to consume everything he touches. By burning away the taint of past guilt, he is also the god who dispenses immortality to those who have achieved unity with the Brahman. He functions as a mediator between men and gods by serving as the altar fire in sacrifices. Agni has the power to create fire anywhere on earth he wishes, and to control any flame anywhere. Agni can change his true form at will, but he always has red skin. Sometimes, he has one face, three legs, and seven arms and tongues. Other times, he has up to seven faces, three arms, and two legs.
Agni is a beneficent god and is willing to be a guest in even the poorest home. When beseeched by one of his worshipers, there is a chance that Agni will send his avatar to aid the worshiper. Abuse of the god’s kindness is certain to earn Agni’s wrath. Omens from Agni are always seen in fires. 
He resides with Vayu and Indra in the Realm of Swarga in Limbo. It is a giant spherical vault filled to the halfway point by a sea of enchanted milk. Agni's castle there is a rampant flame that consumes everything it touches; only those specifically blessed by Agni can remain untouched.
