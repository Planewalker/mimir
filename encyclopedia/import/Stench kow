Stench kine are
  Baator's cattle and a major food source there. They roam the
  inhospitable landscape of the lower planes in great herds, grazing on
  noxious plants that would be poisonous to most creatures. They are most
  common on Baator, but some herds are known to exist on Acheron, Gehenna, and
  the Gray Waste. Stench kow burger can be purchased at Ronnell Maughdonnel's restaurants.
A stench kow resembles a bison, but is
  hideously misshapen. They are humpbacked (males have larger humps) and have
  long, downward curving horns. Their heads are huge with hideous features,
  large round staring eyes, and lolling tongues. They are dull orange in color,
  with matted green manes.
The stench of a stench kow's body is equivalent to a stinking cloud spell.
