Also called Assassin Devils, Dogai are Baatezu living as their name implies.
Assassin devils are outcasts in the legions of Baatezu because they are such efficient assassins. An assassin devil on the move is one in search of a victim, and most devils assume the worst when one of these killers appears. The denizens of Baator have a saying: "The assassin devil you see is the assassin devil sent to kill you." Even the mightiest bullies in Baator give these baatezu a wide berth.
