Kaorti are beings from the Far Realm, descendents of humans who ended up in that alien Plane and were consequently absorbed by some unfathomable godlike monstrosity and spit out as something completely unrecognizable. Some of the kaorti have returned to the known planes, which they've discovered are now completely inhospitable to their kind.
Consequently, they work to transform the known planes into something more like the Far Realm they left behind.
