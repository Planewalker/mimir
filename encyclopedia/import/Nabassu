Nabassus (NAH-bah-soo) are a breed of greater Tanar'ri whose life cycle is linked to the race of ghouls.
Tall and sinewy, nabassu have scaly bodies, horned heads, and batlike wings. They send their young to other planes to steal away the death of mortals, transforming them into endlessly hungry ghouls. After a larval nabassu has eaten enough death it becomes fully mature and ready to take its place in the Abyss.
Mature nabassus are normally kept in fortress-prisons where they will not bother the other tanar'ri. Their enormous, bloated Nursemother is Keekaku.
