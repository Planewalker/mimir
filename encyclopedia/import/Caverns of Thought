The Caverns of Thought are the Realm of the illithid Power, Ilsenine, located in the Outlands near the Dwarven MountainÂ and Gzemid's+Realm and is connected, via tunnels, to both. The underground realm consists of a maze of caverns at the center of which is the power itself. As one enters the Caverns, a mental drone can be heard and as one travels deeper within, the drone becomes louder and more painful.
