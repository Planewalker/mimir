As far as anyone knows, Gith has no descendents. It may, however, refer to the various risque come-ons that made her so popular amongst her people. Or it may be a line she drew in the sand when she chose to lead her people against the Illithids. Of course it may be a style of dance she invented to raise her people's morale. The possibilities are endless. References to The Line are Dark.
