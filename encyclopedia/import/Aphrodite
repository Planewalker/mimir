The beautiful Aphrodite was created from a mixture of sea foam and the blood of Uranus. She is the Greek Power of beauty and love. As befits the goddess her position, she is an enthusiastic companion of the male gods. She is also married to Hephaestus, but this does not stop her from consorting with Ares, Poseidon, Dionysus, and others. Aphrodite can charm any male, either god or mortal, and can generate any strong emotion (such as love, hate, anger, sorrow, etc.) in any intelligent being. Although she can assume any form (all of them beautiful), in her true form she is a woman of astonishing beauty.
She is very popular among the Society of Sensation.
She resides with the rest of the Greek Pantheon in Olympus. Her Case is a palace of quartz and gems, polished to the quality of a fine mirror. The fountain Evergold is sometimes found in the palace's center.
