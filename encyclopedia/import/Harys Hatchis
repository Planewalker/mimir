Harys Hatchis is a popular and eccentric wizard and promotional expert in the City of Doors. In his mid-forties, Harys has a bald head, a straw-thin body, and a Bubber’s crooked grin (although he never indulges). For frugal clients, he designs colorful posters, displaying them in a few key locations; for an extra fee, he’ll cast fly on one of his staff members, who’ll shower the city with handbills. For clients willing to part with the Jink, Harys happily devises one-of-a-kind promotions.
After the Faction War, Hatchis sits on the Sigil Advisory Council and runs the Hall of Speakers.
