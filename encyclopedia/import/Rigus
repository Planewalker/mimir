Rigus is a city in the Outlands, the Gate-town to Acheron. 
Rigus is a permanent military camp arranged in seven octagonal rings on a massive hill. Everyone who enters the city is given a rank, even guests. Guests who lose their identification can be demoted to slave-soldier status right quick.
The military orders of Rigus are ultimately controlled by a shadowy group of liches, or death knights, or something similar. They're all powerful generals who were killed; chant is the city itself prevents their souls from leaving the city's Crown or becoming Petitioners, instead empowering them in an awful half-life so that they can continue to serve.
