Called 'the Sigil of the Elements,' the City of Glass is a planar metropolis located in the Elemental+Plane of Water. It was previously ruled by marids, who called it P'unkar, but is now in the hands of a merchant council representing many different races.
The City of Glass is a dome made of steel-hard glass on a chunk of nevermelting ice, with many buildings and Portals to various other elemental planes in between. Its portals and air make it a popular stop among those traveling the Inner Planes.
