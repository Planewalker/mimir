Meness is the god of the moon in the Slavic Pantheon. He protects those who travel at night, and is patron of warriors and rogues. He appears as a youthful manÂ  of regal bearing wearing a crown and a cloak filled with stars. Like Dazhbog, he rides across the sky in a chariot. He is a rival of Perun, who struck his face with a lightning bolt in punishment for lusting after a goddess other than his wife Saule.
