A Factor is a high-ranking member of a Faction. They may be given many names - in the Xaositects, factors are called "big bosses," while in the Fraternity of Order they're called "bureau chiefs" and in the Doomguard they're called "Doomlords." These characters are among the leaders of the faction, but below the rank of Factol.
They outrank the factotums.
