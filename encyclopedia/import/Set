A cold and calculating god, Set is the jealous personification of evil. He always acts against the interests of mankind and the powers of the Egyptian Pantheon. His followers are a dark and scorned lot who work under of darkness and keep themselves cloaked in treachery and deceit. 
Set is the son of Geb and Nut. His birth was horrific by any measure, for he tore himself free from his mother’s womb sprang upon the world as a foul and hideous thing. Although he has the body of a human male, his head is that of a jackal. Set’s supreme act of evil was murdering the god Osiris. 
Set guards his power and his secrets carefully. He is always looking for ways to recruit new followers and disrupt the churches of the other Egyptian gods. Despite his loathsome nature, Set takes good care of his followers and will not willingly betray or abandon his people.
His Realm, Ankhwugaht, is located on Baator's Layer of Stygia.
In the Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting on the planet Abeir-Toril, Set is a member of the Mulhorandi pantheon and seeks to become god-king.  Some yuan-ti also worship him under the name Sseth. In the Astromundi+Cluster he is known as Seltaine, where he is worshiped by humans and neogi.
