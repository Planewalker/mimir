Drow are a subspecies of elf, generally shorter with dark skin and blond or white hair. On many Prime worlds, drow are reviled and assumed to be evil, cruel and chaotic. They have a traditional association with spiders and the goddess Lolth whose domain may be found in the Abyss.   However, there have been drow who had chosen not to follow the Spidar Queen or their races evil tendancies.  These indivduals sometimes manage to escape the pristiess of Lloth and become champions of good on some Prime worlds.
Drow are even rarer on the planes than elves are, but communities of drow may be found on Ysgard, the third Layer of Nidavellir.
