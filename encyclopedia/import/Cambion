A cambion (KAM-bee-on) is a male half-fiend, often the product of a succubus (or incubus) and a mortal. They can also be descended from other Tanar'ri.
Some are more specific, counting only those half-fiends whose fathers were tanar'ri and whose mothers were tieflings as cambions.
Their female counterparts are the alu-fiends.
