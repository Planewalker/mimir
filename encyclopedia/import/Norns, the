Although lesser powers, the Norns possess the most important power of the Norse Pantheon: they are the ones who dictate the fate of the newborn — for both men and gods alike. There are three Norns, all of whom are female. Urd embodies the past, Verdandi the present, and Skuld the future. Once they have decreed a being’s fate, no force in the Multiverse can alter their decision. 
Of course, the Norns can see all things in the past, present, and future, but they employ these powers only among themselves or to answer questions of slight import for very large amount of Jink. They also have the power to assume any form they wish. In their true forms, Urd is a giantess, Verdandi a beautiful female elf, and Skuld a handsome female dwarf.
It is said that when a child is born, the Norns always appear, disguised as some combination of three animals, and pass their judgment on the baby’s fate. If the parents recognize them and offer all three great gifts, the Norns will be persuaded to dictate a great future for the child. This is an extremely hazardous undertaking, however. If the parents do not give gifts of equal value to the Norns, or happen to miss one by offering her gift to a mundane animal, the offended Norn will grow jealous and turn the gifts of her peers into a curse.
They can be found at the Realm of the Norns in the Outlands.
