Haelyn is a greater Power of the Cerilian pantheon. He is called "the Lawmaker" by his followers and lives in his realm called "Honor's Glory" in Mercuria, the second  peak of Mount Celestia.
Honor's Glory is a land of rolling hills and grassland, dotted with castles and manors for the greatest of Haelyn's heroes. It represents the world as Haelyn would like to see it; a vision of idyllic peace where all know their place in society and the importance of their place to the working of the whole. Haelyn spends his time here challenging the greatest and most noble generals of Anuire and other lands to battles in which the rules of honor are always followed and the losers of each conflict surrender gracefully to the winners so that none are seriously injured.
