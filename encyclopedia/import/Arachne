Arachne was a woman punished for her hubris by the goddess Athena, who transformed her into a spider. Other versions of the myth say she committed suicide, and Athena transformed her into a spider rather than consign her to the world of the dead.
The 1e adventure Queen of the Demonweb Pits claimed that Arachne was the true name of Lolth, although "Araushnee" is now believed to be the correct pronounciation (according to Demihuman Deities and Races of the Wild, to name two sources).
