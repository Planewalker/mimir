Haela is the patron of dwarves who love the fray, who wander the surface lands, who brave unknown dangers, and who battle monsters. She is the special patron of good-aligned dwarven barbarians and battleragers.
Haela dwells in a simple cave in the Beastlands on the Layer of Brux, keeping to herself, hidden by the everpresent mists of the forest. Findar Endar, as her Realm is known, is protected by her Guardians. Haela herself is rarely at home, wandering the Prime Material Plane wherever dwarves need aid.
