Yemeth is best (or perhaps only) known for the pendant that bares his name, the Pendant of Yemeth. Yemeth wasÂ a sorcerer of a by-gone age. Though Yemeth's power was great, time began to take its toll on him; he began to grow weak and sodden. The Pendant was commissioned by the dying wizard to serve as a vessel for souls -- souls which Yemeth himself would draw from dying mortals, and later use to power his waning life-force. Yemeth was eventually slain in a battle, destroyed utterly, and the Pendant was lost. Sages said that, even if the Pendant were to be recovered, no mortal knows the secrets of its use.
The pendant is constructed of some silvery metal. Six crystals radiate from the skull in a circle, forming a crown of sorts. A leather lanyard is looped though an eyehole attached to the top of the skull.
