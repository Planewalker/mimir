Procan is an ancient, primal god of storms and the untamed sea. He is wild and tempestuous; he can be benevolent or malevolent at turns, but generally cares nothing for humanity unless carefully propitiated - and perhaps not even then. He's the embodiment of mercurial winds and uncertain fate. He's an elder god, almost like a titan, though he roams the cosmos freely. He is said to have aided in the banishment of Panzuriel.
His children (Atroa, Sotillion, Telchur, Velnius, and Wenta) are closer to humanity, though they still share something of his nature.
Procan's realm, Seasedge, is in Limbo.
