The animal lords are the kings of the Beastlands, embodiments of various nonmagical animal species. They include the Cat Lord, the Dog Lord, the Lizard lord, the Hawk Lord, the Wolf Lord, and the Dinosaur Lord. 
They have the power to take on animal or humanoid forms. Some say they embody more the beliefs about an animal than the animals themselves, but they are as neutral, feral, and unconcerned about the niceties of ethics as any beast.
