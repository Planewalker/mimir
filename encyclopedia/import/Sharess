Sharess, an aspect of the Egyptian goddess Bast, is a Faerun Power of hedonism, excess, festhalls and sensual fulfillment.
She is often depicted as a beautiful, voluptuous woman with the head of a cat. She inhabits Brightwater, where her Realm is called simply Rapture. Rapture is the darkest of the city's quarters, filled with dark, twisting alleys and somewhat shady establishments. Rapture is physically and philosophically located between the Quarter of the Orange Lanterns (ruled by Lliira) and Heartfire (ruled by Sune).
As Bast, she rules a realm in Ysgard called Merratet.
Her priestesses are called Sensates, like the Faction.
