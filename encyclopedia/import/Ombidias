Ombidias, a voadkyn from the little-known Prime world Glemayne, is a former Factor of the Believers of the Source and the current Factol of the Mind's Eye. Upon his election following the Faction War, he led the newly-formed Seekers out of Sigil and into the planes to find what destiny awaited them, ready to find the inspiration and motivation that their predecessors had lacked.
