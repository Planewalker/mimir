The baltiri (singular: baltir) are a race of Galadur native to Arborea and Ysgard. They often serve as familiars for chaotic good spellcasters.
A baltir can polymorph itself into a human or demihuman child, as the telperi and glissi do. It can also take the form of a cat, an otter, or a miniature lion.
In size, baltiri don’t quite measure up; they’re shorter than the rest of the galadur in their unpolymorphed state. Still, they are broad of build and look like handsome, muscular humans with somewhat flat faces and tufted pointy ears. A short, glittering, fiery red fur covers their entire body. They have broad wings and glistening lionlike manes that match the color of their fur. Baltiri have broad smiles and green or brown almond-shaped eyes.
