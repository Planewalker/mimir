An imp is a type of minor devilkin, often assigned to wizards as familiars. Their job is to corrupt (or keep corrupted) their masters so that they end up as Petitioners in the Baator. Most imps are small, red-skinned creatures with poison stingers at the ends of their tails, but there are also variant types: the bloodbag imp, the euphoric imp, and the filth imp.
Imps are lawful evil examples of the Burzugdur race.
