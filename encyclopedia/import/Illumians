Illumians are humanoids found on Prime Worlds, Astral and also the Plane of Shadow. They were formed by a magic ritual by a Tarmuid, who they now hail as their creator.
Illumians look like humans for the most part. The characteristic that sets them apart, however, are the multitude of glowing arcane symbols that circle around their heads.
