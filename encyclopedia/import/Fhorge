The common fhorge (pronounced FOUR-jay) is a large, foul-tempered planar relative of boars native to the Outlands, Acheron, and Baator. Fhorges are not intelligent and are neither good nor evil. They have no supernatural powers, but they have an effective charge attack and can continue to fight long after they ought to have died. Like quills, they survive in places most creatures cannot due to their ability to eat just about anything, even Razorvine.
Fhorges taste good roasted with garlic and pepper.
