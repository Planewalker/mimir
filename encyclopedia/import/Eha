EHA, the Wind Sprite, is the goddess of clouds, smoke, steam, winds, flutes, and horns in the pantheon of Maztica. She is the giver of breath to newborns, and the harbinger of spring. She accepts small offerings of cocoa or mayz.
She manifests as a shifting plume of white smoke resembling a human woman of various shapes and sizes. As a chaotic neutral Maztican deity, her Realm is Mayel in the Plane of Limbo. Mayel is named for a human consort that Eha once took, and it represents a calm place of refuge within that wild, tumultuous plane.
