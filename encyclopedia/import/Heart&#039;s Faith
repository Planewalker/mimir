Heart's Faith is the Burg on the other side of the Portal from the Outlands Gate-town of Excelsior, making it a gate-town in the same way that the Abyss's Broken Reach is. It lies on the shores of the Silver Sea on Mount Celestia's first Layer, Lunia. The portal itself can be found above the sea itself, offshore from Heart's Faith. The town is ruled by a council of lammasus led by Lebes, although during the recent unscheduled Modron+March through the town, while the lammasus were away on retreat, the Aasimar Cauldronborn served as Mayor to great effect, minimizing casualties amongst the burg's citizenry. The modron army reached the portal by building a bridge out to it.
