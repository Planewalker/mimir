The Githyanki knights are the most respected and feared members of githyanki society, the eyes, hands, and swords of the Revered Lich-Queen. Every city, fortress, and outpost of the githyanki is governed by a knight who usually reports directly to the Queen. They are the highest echelon of the githyanki warrior castes. They are figures of awe and reverence, the closest things the godless githyanki people have to priests, and their reverence for the Lich-Queen approaches worship.
Every knight is a blackguard, in game terms. Their badges of office are their silver swords.
