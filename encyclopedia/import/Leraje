Leraje, the Green Herald, is a Vestige described in the 3e Tome of Magic. Once a servant of Corellon Larethian, the greatest archer who ever lived and the one who taught archery to the elves at the dawn of creation, before the fall of Lolth. Because of her stubborn pride, she challenged Corellon himself to a duel. She won, too, but because the archery target was her own heart she wasn't able to celebrate her victory.
