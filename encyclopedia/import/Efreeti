Efreet (singular: efreeti) are sardonic and proud genies of fire. They don't think of themselves as evil: well organized, yes, and they admit to an enlightened sense of self-interest. Their leaders, however, are allied with the Baatezu. 
Efreet are massive humanoids with eyes of flame and pitch black or red skin. They're said to be made of equal parts basalt, bronze, solid flame, and anger. Like baatezu they can be cruel, and are masters of deception.
The capital city of the efreet is the City of Brass, where they are ruled by a sultan. The efreet hate the Djinn with a terrible passion, and the two races are often at war. They trade with Dao, but dislike Marid. They dominate the Jann whenever they can.
Powers worshiped by the efreet include Agni, Freya, Kossuth, Imix, and Kaelthiere.
