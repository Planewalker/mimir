Daru Ib Shamiq is an ancient Baernaloth who is best known (to those who know the Dark of the matter) for corrupting the Maeldur Et Kavurik. The baernaloth now resides in Gehenna, near a Portal to the Gate-town of Torch. It appears to be an emaciated Fiend, covered with pus and sores, and occasionally spitting up mucus that matches the color of the organic coating of the cavern in which it lives.
