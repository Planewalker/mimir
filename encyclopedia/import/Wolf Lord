The Wolf Lord is one of the Animal Lords found on the Beastlands on the Planes. He acts as the master of lupines on that plane, whether they be foxes, wolves, dogs and the like. 
He takes the appearance of a tall human with wolf ears and shaggy hair. He wears clothes like that of a ranger. He has the ability to take on the form of a wolf as well, of course, and that is as much his natural form as anything else.
Should he ever be slain, another wolf will rise up in his place to become the next Wolf Lord.
He is allied with the wind-god Telchur.
