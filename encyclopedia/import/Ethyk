Ethyks [/b]are small creatures like one-eyed lemurs, native to Bytopia. They have the power to alter the emotions of others, making them more aggressive. They can be trained to release this power only on people other than their owners. 
Ethyks are not permitted in the Hall of Speakers. A trained ethyk costs about 150 gp in Sigil's Market Ward.
