Odur, Norse demigod of the sun, is the husband of Freya. He drives the day chariot across the sky, endlessly pursued by the monstrous wolf Skoll. When he is away, Freya weeps tears of gold.
A chaotic good deity, his portfolio includes light, travel, and the sun. He teaches that freedom from care and worry comes from accepting responsibility and duty with joy. His temples are open structures, letting in the sun's light.
Though he is married to one of the Vanir, some claim he is in truth an aspect of Odin.
