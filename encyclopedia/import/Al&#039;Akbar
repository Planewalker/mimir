A god of guardianship, faithfulness, and duty worshipped by the Baklunish people of Oerth, Al'Akbar was a mortal priest granted a divine cup and talisman to help heal the wounds of his people after a cataclysm remembered as the Invoked Devastation. 
After becoming the founding caliph of the nation of Ekbir, he ascended to true divinity. Al'Akbar remains a demigod despite the faith he founded dominating
Baklunish culture out of respect for the rest of the pantheon. This religion is bitterly divided between the NG and LG Exalted Faith and the strictly LN True Faith.
Al'Akbar has no realm of his own. He dwells in Mount Celestia's fifth layer, Mertion, in Soqed Hezi, the City of Swords, which is controlled by the sword archons; he is only a guest there. The ruler of Soqed Hezi is the sword archon Bahram, known as the Conquering and Triumphant Fire, who answers only to the Tome Archon Raziel.
