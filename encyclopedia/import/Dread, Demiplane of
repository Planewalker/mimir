This insidious Demiplane pulls lands and individuals of great evil and tragedy from various locations on the Prime Material Plane, warping and twisting them into darker reflections of their former selves, sealed behind gray mists. Its rulers, the mysterious Dark Powers, are conducting a vast experiment for reasons unknown. Are they good entities locking away beings of evil? Or evil beings collecting beings of evil, letting them gestate and improve themselves for malevolent ends? And why do they sometimes bring in good beings to oppose them? 
See, the Demiplane of Dread - also known as Ravenloft after a castle there -Â  is a prison. Those who enter it don't escape it easily, as spells, items, and abilities that permit planar travel stops working. Its inhabitants mourn and breed, generation after generation. In fact, most inhabitants of the demiplane are neither particularly good or evil; they're just there to torment the inmates, or be tormented by them. Or is there more to it than that?
