Gelf is Garl Glittergold's brother, and rarely have two brothers been
more bitter rivals. Gelf, depicted as a gray-skinned dwarf with a black
beard, takes obsessive delight in opposing everything his brother
attempts. This compulsion puts Gelf in the tragic position of tearing
down the Gnome society he loves, just to thwart Garl Glittergold. Gelf
isn't evil, but he feels compelled to destroy everything Garl holds
dear. Gelf is an angry, sorrowful deity, and he attracts followers of
similar temperament.
The name and location of his divine Realm is unknown.
