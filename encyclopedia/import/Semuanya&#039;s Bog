Semuanya's Bog is the Realm of the lizardman Power Semuanya and lies at one end of Tir+fo+Thiunn, spireward of the Gate-town of Curst. The bog is an untamed, primordial place and is filled with lizardman Petitioners, reptiles of all typesÂ and what will eventually be their meals. At its center lies the lethargic Semuanya itself.
