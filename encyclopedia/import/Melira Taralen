Melira Taralen is a lesser goddess of minstrels, bards, and songwriting who, like many of her followers, has a patron (in this case, Corellon). It is said that her mother Hanali Celanil sent her to Corellon to serve as an apprentice, found with her skills that he set a place in the stars for her. Melira is most often found near Evergold, singing and playing while her mother relaxes. If she has any rivals, it is the Faerunian god Milil, whom she feels may be “poaching” in her territory. Still, theirs is a friendly rivalry, and he has performed some duets with her. She also enjoys Olidammara’s exploits, though he’s often too roguish for her taste.
