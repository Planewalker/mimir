The last layer of Carceri, Agathys, is the spiritual home of those who falsely pretended friendship. It consists of a single orb of black ice alone in the void, almost completely devoid of light and sound, with only the shifting and breaking of ice and the slow, crushing agony of petitioners frozen into it being heard. Apomps' Three-Sided Palace, realm of the Gehreleth lord Apomps can be found on Agathys. The god Nerull also makes his home on Agathys.
