When most planewalkers think of the Outlands, they think of the Ringlands, the region that stretches from the Gate-towns to the Spire. But beyond the gate-towns is a vast infinity, a wild, ever-changing, generally unexplored land. They've been called the Birthplace of the Planes, or the Lands Beyond Belief, or the Eternal Uncertainty, but mostly they're called the Hinterlands[/b]. It's a cert that the normally reliable concepts of space and time simple don't work properly there: A Cutter can walk with his back to the Spire for days, turn, and a few hours later he'll be near a gate-town again! Some folksâ€™ve heard talk of lost cities, new gates to unknown planes, even whole other realities if a body ventures far enough.
