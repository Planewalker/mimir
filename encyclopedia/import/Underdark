Beneath the surface of many Prime Material Plane worlds is a network of caverns, tunnels, mines, and vaults known to some as the Underdark. Whether this network is continuous or a series of isolated pockets depends on the world. 
Inhabitants of the Underdark include illithids, drow, kuo-toas, Pech, quaggoths, orogs, gloamings, aboleths, duergar, cloakers, and more.
