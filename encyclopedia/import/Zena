Zena is a Tiefling Factotum in the Believers of the Source. Her specialty is animals.
She's an attractive tiefling with dark eyes, high cheekbones, a thin
nose, pointed chin, pouting lips, and small horns curving up her
forehead. Most people don't like her, though - her speeches on the suffering of animals get incredibly wearying and tiresome. Even her twin sister, Zakarias, detests her.
