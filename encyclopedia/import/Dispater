Dispater is the Iron Lord, ruler of the Iron City of Dis and the entire second layer of Baator. He is an old Baatezu, one of the eldest of the Lords of the Nine. Dispater is extremely cautious and conservative, never leaving his tower unless he can help it, and disapproving of lords of non-baatezu origin like Triel+the+Fallen. His consort is named Lilis.
Dispater's expertise is in manipulating emotions, shaping the baser instincts to his will. He never loses his temper, priding himself on his restraint and smooth manner. He is a master of arcane magic and an indomitable fighter. 
Dispater's city is a mazelike place continuously shifting and changing, but it is the most mercantile and populous of all the cities of Baator. Beings from all over the Multiverse travel there, often to their sorrow. 
Dispater plays an important role in the "Fires+of+Dis" Planescape adventure.
