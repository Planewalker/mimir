Duke Kharash the Stalker is the closest companion to Talisid, sharing his passion for the hunt and his love for untamed wilderness. Unless Talisid is entering a settled area, the two are inseperable. Kharash is bold and sly of tongue, but dislikes large groups.
He's a ten foot tall, black-furred humanoid with wolflike features.
