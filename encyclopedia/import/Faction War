The Faction War began with the disappearance of all the Factols in Sigil and became more desperate when all Portals in the city sealed themselves up. Much blood and devastation ensued.
At the end, the Mercykillers split into two factions: the Sodkillers and the Sons of Mercy. The Believers of the Source and Sign of One merged into one faction, the Mind's Eye. The Athar, Harmonium, Fated, Doomguard, Fraternity of Order, and Revolutionary League all relocated their headquarters outside the city.
