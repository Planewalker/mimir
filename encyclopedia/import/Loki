Loki is the Norse Power of mischief and strife. A sly, vengeful trickster who is always causing trouble among the gods, he is tolerated in Asgard only because of the great services he has performed in the past, such as helping to create Midgard and the wall guarding Asgard. Loki has the power to change his shape into anything. If any being, including other gods, look at Loki for more than three rounds, he can exert his influence over them. He also wears a pair of boots that allow him to walk on water, fly, and run at great speed. In his true form, Loki is a handsome young man who is always dressed in some combination of red and black.
As the god of mischief and strife, Loki is one of the most active and unpleasant of gods. Yet, there is also an attractive side to his personality: he is handsome, sociable, and has a good sense of humor. Loki is one of the few gods who is at home with giants and dwarves, and often turns to them for help in his schemes. He is invariably in some sort of trouble with his fellows and will not hesitate to turn to his worshipers for help in extracting himself. Omens from Loki usually come in the form of an illusion.
He lives primarily in Asgard, but also has a hidden Realm in Pandemonium called Winter's Hall to which he retreats when in trouble with his fellow gods.
