Osiris is the Egyptian god of the harvest, nature, and the underworld, god of death and life. He is portrayed as a mummy, and he is served by both undead and the living. 
His realm is in Buxenus, the second Layer of Arcadia. There he shares the realm of Heliopolis with his son Horus, his wife Isis, and his great-grandfather Ra. His portion of the realm, Memphiria, City of the White Crown, is chilly and located both above ground and below. He is the father of Anubis (with Nephythys).
Osiris, as a serene god of the dead, is widely worshipped by Dustmen.
