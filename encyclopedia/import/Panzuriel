Panzuriel (not to be confused with Pazrael) was banished long ago by Deep Sashelas and a powerful human sea god (variously named as Manannan mac Lir, Poseidon, Procan or another) to a stinking, briny pool in Niflheim called Rezuriel. His severed foot remained behind on the Material+Plane, which has allowed him to slowly regain his power among the evil races of the sea - koalinths, merrow, sahuaghin, scrags, and particularly krakens. He may be the father of Laogzed.
