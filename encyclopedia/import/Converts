The Converts, also called the Chamaeleons, are a Sect that believes that no Faction or sect has the whole truth, but they may have some of it. Members of the Converts, therefore, join faction after faction, sect after sect to find that kernal of truth that, when combined with the other kernals, leads to the Ultimate Truth of the Multiverse. Of course, turning+stag on the factions can get a Basher put in the Dead-book right quick, so these folks have to be mighty Canny to attain their goal.
