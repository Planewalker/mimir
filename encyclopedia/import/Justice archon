Justice archons, slightly stronger than warden+archons, resemble radiant golden winged humanoids. They exist to fight fiends and other creatures of evil; they have a special hatred for yugoloths. When not on missions, they primarily inhabit Empyrea, the City of Tempered Souls on Mertion, but some justice archons choose voluntary exile on the Material+Plane in order to guard Portals to the Lower Planes. They tend to get angry at the mere suspicion of wrongdoing.
