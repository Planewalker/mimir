Bel is the Warlord of Avernus. He is an ancient being responsible for many famed Baatezu victories in the Blood War. Thousands of years ago he staged a coup against the previous Lord of the First, Zariel, with the aid of the Sign of One faction and the Dark Eight, imprisoning his predecessor under his fortress while he slowly drains her of her power. 
However, Bel is still the weakest of the Lords of the Nine, as he cannot back out of his responsibilities to the Dark Eight and must still lead troops in the Blood War as well as overseeing the maintenance of his layer. He controls the Third Command of the baatezu legions, along with his co-generals, the gelugons Meritos and Hanariel. His troops are mostly ground forces, infantry, Abishai, and Least baatezu. Bel must vie for the approval of Dagos of the Dark Eight like every other baatezu general. His command is not prestigious, but Bel is a cunning and determined general. 
Avernus has become a little fiercer, more brutal than it was under Zariel's rule. The fireballs that fill its skies are said to be manifestations of Zariel's helpless rage. 
Bel usually manifests as the pit fiend he was before his ascension to his current position, or as a burly humanoid with reddish flesh, a jutting chin, a brooding scowl, and powerful arms.
