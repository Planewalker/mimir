Vishnu is the greater god of mercy and light in the Indian Pantheon. He most commonly appears as a normal man with four arms, but can appear in almost any form. 
He dwells with his wife Lakshmi in a Realm in Mercuria called the Divine Lotus. Adjacent to Goldfire, the realm of Surya and Mitra, the Divine Lotus is a huge expanse of rich and fertile jungle with stone temples that detail the exploits of the Lawful and Good members of the mythos above those considered evil and chaotic. Garuda, king of all birds, can sometimes be seen here, although he visits Goldfire as well.
