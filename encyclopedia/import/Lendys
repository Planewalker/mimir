Lendys is the draconic god of justice. He has no mercy or forgiveness, ensuring that those who do evil receive evil, and those who do good receive good. Unlike Chronepsis, he works to bring justice in life rather than in the afterlife.
Lendys dwells in Mechanus. Sometimes he manifests as a huge, platinum-colored dragon with eyes that bring forth brilliant beams of light from which no one can hide. His mate is Tamara, mercy to his justice. Some myths claim that he is the father of Bahamut.
