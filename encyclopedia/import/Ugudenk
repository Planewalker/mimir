Ugudenk, the Squirming King,&nbsp;is an Obyrith Abyssal+lord of worms and hungry parasites, ruling a Layer called the Writhing Realm, catalogued as the 177th tier of the+Abyss. He often burrows into Hollow's Heart, the Layer of Fraz-Urb'luu, and while the latter lord was imprisoned he claimed a portion - now called the Spiral of Ugudenk - as his own, infesting it with writhing minions. The spiralling cavern in the center winds all the way to the Writhing Realm itself, and Fraz-Urb'luu has thus far been unable to destroy it.
