The largest city of Graz'zt's realm, Zelatar exists in all three layers of Azzagrat. Doorways may allow exit onto a street or into a building, but the building interior or the street could very well exist on a different layer of the Abyss. The inhabitants of Zelatar (Tanar'ri, alu-fiends, tieflings, and others who revere Graz'zt) soon learn the ways of the shifting Portals, but most visitors require a Tout to get from place to place within the city. The Argent Palace is Graz'zt's abode of sixty-six ivory towers and one hundred cold, mirrored halls. The palace is visible from anywhere in Zelatar, regardless of which layer the observer is looking from. It is a sterile, echoing space where those seeking Graz'zt's audience room must wend their way through the mirror and portal maze in which ravenous bodaks roam.
