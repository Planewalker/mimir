Vortices (vortex, singular) are similar in many ways to portals, save that they always lead to one of the inner or energy planes, and that they are constantly open without the need of a Portal Key.
Vortices are typically found in places where the element represented by the elemental plane they lead to is particularly strong. For instance, a vortex to elemental water might be found deep in an ocean trench, or a vortex to elemental fire or paraelemental magma might be found in the heart of a volcano.
Elemental vortices are also commonly found to spontaneously appear and vanish within the Slags, a district in Sigil's Hive Ward on the border with the Clerk's Ward.
Well-known vortices include the Pale River, Iron Crucible, Bubble Net, and the plume of Jabal Turab.
Other Uses
A vortex is also the name of a whirlwind-like creature from the Elemental Plane of Air.
