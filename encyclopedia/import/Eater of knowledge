The eaters of knowledge are servants of Ilsensine resembling large, humanoid heaps of leathery hide and exposed ganglia with naked brain matter oozing from openings in their distended skulls. They are extremely intelligent and remorseless beings with a variety of dangerous psionic powers. 
They exist only to work Ilsensine's will.
