Tso are a race of slavers, smugglers, and cross-traders who roam the Outlands, Acheron, Baator, and Mechanus. They're the size of humans, with spiderlike bodies, and eellike heads; they use their rearmost four legs for walking, and four smaller, prehensile limbs for manipulating objects (and whatever else they can manipulate). Like their smaller Prime cousins, the neogi, they have the power to enslave other creatures; unlike neogi, they are all sorcerers capable of casting cooperative magic. 
Tso are social creatures, devoted to their broods. They are commonly found with groups of enslaved humans, Planetouched, Githzerai, least fiends, drone-caste modrons, reaves, and/or Khaasta.
The greed of the tso is legendary.
