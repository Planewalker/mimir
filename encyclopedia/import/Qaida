Qaida's a Dustman, an Aasimar Proxy of Arawn. Did I say aasimar? More like half-celestial; her father's a Planetar seduced by an evil human wizardess. She takes after her father physically, with emerald skin and a smooth, hairless head (no wings, though). Her personality takes after her mother, more's the pity. She carries a scythe like the grim reaper she is, and currently she's looking to collect on the contract owed by Verden. More than that, she's looking to collect her whole faction, to take it over with herself as the new Factol.
