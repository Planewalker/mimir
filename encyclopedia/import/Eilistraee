Eilistraee, also known as "The Dark Maiden" is a Power of the drow pantheon. Her areas of concern are song, swordwork, hunting, the moon and beauty. Her worshippers are good-aligned drow hoping to escape the evils of the Underdark's evil, Lolth-worshipping matriarchal society, and regain a place in the surface world.
She is worshipped by song and dance, if at all possible, in the surface world under the moonlit night among the woods. She takes great pleasure in bards learning new songs, craftsmen at work, and the doing of kindhearted deeds. Among her followers are drow, humans, gnomes, elves, shapeshifters and half-elves.
Eilistraee is represented by a drow female in the nude, dancing with a silver sword under the moon. The Dark Maiden's Realm is in Svartalfheim in Ysgard. 
In Torilean Cosmology, Eilistraee is the daughter of Corellon Larethian and of Araushnee (who after being punished by Corellon assumed the name Lolth) and was cast down along with the rest of the drow pantheon for her apparent part in the war against the Seldarine. Once she was cleared of any wrongdoing, she insisted to her father that she be punished in the same manner as her sibling Vhaeraun and mother. She realized that the drow people would later need an escape from the malevolent priestesses of Lloth.
