A markeen, or genie double, is a lesser race of Genie exiled from the majority of their kind for a crime they remember but do not speak of, cursed at birth to be the spitting image of a human being. They don't share memories, thought, or place of birth with their mortal doubles, but they're born at the exact same instant.
Not everyone has a genie double. Generally only famous, wealthy, beautiful, gifted, holy, or utterly villainous individuals have them - those who Fate has great plans for. Doubles of bards or poets are called the hayan - they may inspire their doubles to create works of literary greatness.
Markeen have few magical powers. They can fly, turn invisible, create blades of flame, and summon minor air elementals. They are tinkers, merchants, sailors, and horse traders. They can be of any Alignment, but they tend to be affable and friendly. They live by their wits, tricking, befuddling, and sometimes swindling the mortals they live among.
