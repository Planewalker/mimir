Lao Tzu is the legendary philosopher who compiled the Tao-te-Ching, the basis of Taoist thought. After finishing this wonderful book, Lao Tzu was brought into the Celestial Bureaucracy. He mounted a green ox and rode away into the sunset. Lao Tzu is now venerated as the founder of Taoism. He is worshipped by mystical philosophers hoping for assistance in achieving true enlightenment.
Lao Tzu is in charge of intuitive knowledge and mystical enlightenment, which he grants sparingly. Lao Tzu is fond of visiting his temples and orders in avatar form. Here, he tests his worshipersâ€™ knowledge by drawing them into heated philosophical debates. Omens from Lao Tzu generally assume the form of some natural catastrophe or good fortune, such as an insect plague or a stretch of warm weather in the middle of winter.
Lao Tzu now dwells with Confucius and the Pa Hsien in a Demiplane called the Land of the Immortals.
