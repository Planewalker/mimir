Iuz (pronounced eye-ooze), called the Old One and the Lord of Pain, is a Cambion who became a demigod, the son of Graz'zt and Iggwilv, and the lover and ally of Zuggtmoy. He also has alliances with Lolth and Pazrael. He rules a nation on the world of Oerth and seeks to conquer more. He has made pacts in the past with some of the Abyssal lords to provide Tanar'ri for his armies, although there was a recent set-back when a holy artifact was used to banish many of his fiendish servitors. 
Iuz feels nothing but hatred for Vecna, and the feeling is mutual. Iuz helped banish Vecna to the Demiplane+of+Dread, and Vecna absorbed the cambion's essence as part of his bid to escape and become a greater deity. Iuz escaped after Vecna's defeat in Sigil, but his fury has not abated.
Physically, Iuz looks like a fat human with reddish skin and demonic features; alternatively, he looks like a small, wizened old mannikin of terrible hideousness who attacks with an acidic spittle.
