Shaktari is known as the Queen of Mariliths. She lives on the 531 Layer of the Abyss, called Vudra.
Shaktari is a marilith of gargantuan proportions, with flaming red eyes and skin of
blackest night. This dark Fiend is said to devour all that she sees,
although she spends most of her time 'sleeping' in the crimson oceans
of her Realm.
She is also one of the few souls who's managed to escape from the Wells of Darkness.
