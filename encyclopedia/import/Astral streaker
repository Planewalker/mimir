Astral streakers are friendly avian creatures the size of sparrows common in the Astral Plane (though it's thought that they originally came from the Beastlands - certainly, nothing can breed in the Astral, except in the vicinity of a few dead gods of time). 
They are swifter than most other Astral creatures, and are often used as messengers.
