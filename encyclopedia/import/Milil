Lesser Power of the Beastlands. Milil (Mihl-LiLL) is depicted in religious art and song as a handsome male human or elf with a charismatic manner and a haunting, melodic voice.  He is venerated by human, elf, and half-elf bards, who see him as the One Who Watches While Music is Alive (when they are performing), the Guardian of Singers and Troubadours, and the One True Hand of All-Wise Oghma.
Milil dwells with Deneir in the Library of All Knowledge in the Layer of Brux. The music of harps fills the lonely woods of the realm, and the library itself is housed in several buildings scattered throughout the domain. Together, these buildings contain all writings, maps, glyphs, images, poems, speeches, and songs in the Multiverse.
