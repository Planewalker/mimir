The sibyllic guardian is an Archon with psi-like abilities. They resemble an angelic humanoid with blue pupilless eyes and red glowing glyphs floating around their bodies. They're CR 10. Their initiative should be +7, not +6 (+3 Dex, +4 Improved Initiative).
They believe there is a great war on the horizon, a war only they and other powerful oracles can foresee.
