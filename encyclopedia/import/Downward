Sigil has two sides: downward and Spikeward. "Downward" means toward the Outlands, and "spikeward" means toward the sky, the way the Spire points. 
These directions are traditional, but know one actually knows where the Outlands are relative to Sigil, or even if such terms can be meaningfully applied to the nondimensional nothingness that surrounds the the City of Doors. Neither the Outlands nor the Spire are visible from the city.
