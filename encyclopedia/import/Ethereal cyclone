Ethereal cyclones[/b] are among the most powerful forces in the Ethereal Plane - storms of possibility resembling serpentine columns or whirlwinds uprooting ethereal forms, distorting them, and carrying them across the plane before depositing them somewhere random.
Ether cyclones appear abruptly, without much warning. They can blow a party off course, deposit them in a random plane, or get them lost entirely.
