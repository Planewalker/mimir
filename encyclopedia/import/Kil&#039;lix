Kilâ€™lix is a lesser god of the Neogi Pantheon, the patron of
murderers and assassins in the neogi world, and is seen as the darkest
of shadows. Its horrid laugh is high-pitched and whining, yet also deep
and booming, and is said to be heard by those who are about to die.
Kil'lix dwells in the+Abyss, which the neogi know as Karish.
