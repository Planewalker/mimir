Gzemnid, also called the Gas Giant, is the beholder deity of gas, fogs, obscurement, and deception, the only offspring of the Great Mother to reach divinity. Its Realm is in the Outlands beneath the Dwarven Mountain, intertwined with Ilsensine's realm and extending to near the Gate-town of Glorium, where Gzemnid's beholders harry the locals.
