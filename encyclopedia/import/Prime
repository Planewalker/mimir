When the people of Sigil speak of primes, they mean anyone born on the Prime Material Plane. To many Cagers, being prime is synonymous with being Clueless, though many primes have proven themselves the equal or superior to any Planar.
See also Planarists.
"Primes" are also what some call the worlds of the Prime Material Plane. Oerth is a prime; so is Toril.
