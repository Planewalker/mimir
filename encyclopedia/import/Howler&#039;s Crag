Howler's Crag is a jagged spike of stones standing in the center of Cocytus, the second Layer of Pandemonium. These plains lie at the center of an immense cavern, and the Crag itself is a form of message service between various points of the plane.
The Crag itself is a jumbled piles of stones, boulders, and carved portions, the tip glowing with cold blue flame. The lower reaches are riddled with cells; many of them are covered with alien alphabets, liturgies, and strings of numerals. They are either indecipherable or related to a strange phoenix-god, a dead power of travelers, portals, and planewalkers. Its grave is said to lie beneath the stones, or perhaps it became the stones.
