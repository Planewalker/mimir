Skeletal boatmen of the River Styx, marraenoloths sell their services as guides and ferrymen to whoever will pay them. 
When marraenoloths are first promoted to the boatman caste, they abandon the wealth, lands, and privilege they acquired as yagnoloths and their minds and spirits are bound to their skiffs and the River as a whole. Nycaloths watch them to see which ones are worthy of transformation to greater yugoloth status; the nycaloths risk terrible punishment if their judgements are deemed unsatisfactory by their Arcanaloth superiors.
The marraenoloths know virtually everything about the waters - their spirits are spread even more thinly than the hydroloths' are, flowing from one skiff to another so that every marraenoloth is known to every other, and 'loths and skiffs are one. The marraenoloths pick out which hydroloths have become subtle enough to be worthy of promotion, though the nycaloths have final approval and the authority to banish a mistaken marraenoloth from its skiff, crippling it until it manages to create a new one.
Marraenoloths are cruel and mercenary in nature. They will not hesitate to dump those who threaten or underpay them - any of them, ever - into the identity-stealing waters of the Styx. They are servants of Evil first and foremost, but it is impossible to navigate the Styx without them.
