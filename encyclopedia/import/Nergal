Nergal is the god of plague, the underworld, and the dead in the Babylonian pantheon. His realm in Oinos, Nergaltos, is dark and gray, made of black basalt and swirling mists. It is laid out in rings, with seven concentric domes filled with the shades of the dead. At the god's side is his wife Ereshkigal. Nergal always manifests as a dark-skinned human carrying a night-black shield made from the pure substance of Death.
Nergal bound Enki of the Sumerian Pantheon while Anshar killed him with his sword. Enki's father Enlil has sworn vengeance on both Nergal and Anshar.
Nergal is also the name of an exiled (but still powerful) Baatezu noble living in Avernus. There is no relation between the two; the devil's name was changed to Nergal in order to make him more difficult to summon.  See Nergal (archdevil).
