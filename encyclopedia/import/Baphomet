Baphomet is a Tanar'ri Lord of the Abyss, the prince of minotaurs and mazes. He bears great hatred for Yeenoghu, Orcus, and Graz'zt. He was responsible for creating a number of populous Tanar'ri breeds, including the Bulezau, ghours, goristroi, and ankashars.
He lives at the center of a great maze that spans his layer. The maze is populated by all manner of minotaurs, some of whom have breath weapons and magical abilities.
