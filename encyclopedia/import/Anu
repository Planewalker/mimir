Anu is a sky-god, the chief of the Babylonian Pantheon. He is lawful neutral, and said to have created the heavens and the earth, and to be the source of order in the universe. He is the son of Anshar. 
Anu's realm in Mechanus is called Anu's Way, an enormous gear of orderly lines and clay brick buldings. He is served by Einheriar called the soldiers of Anu - they have copper skin, yellow eyes without pupils, and no apparent gender. All have the same memory and knowledge, making them more like modrons than people.
Anu rules from the center of his realm, upon a great raised throne. At his side is the goddess Anutu, his sister and wife.
