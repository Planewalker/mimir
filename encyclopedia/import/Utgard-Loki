Many giants can work magic, but none are so skilled at it as the mountain giant Utgard-Loki, a powerful illusionist and member of the Fated faction. He is one of the mightiest of the giants of Jotunheim; he has wrestled with the Aesir and won through magic. 
He is king of Utgard, the major city and fortress of Jotunheim's giants. He keeps a council of jarls in line through wit and sheer force of will.
