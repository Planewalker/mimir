Kiri-Jolith is a god that likes rules alot. Rules here, and rules there. Sometimes its hard to get between the rules, because there's so many of them. He makes the knights that rides around and shines alot. He could try to make something else now and then, but that's what he's decided on it seems. Paladine likes him.
