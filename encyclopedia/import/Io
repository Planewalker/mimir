Io, the Ninefold Dragon, contains all alignments within him and is seen by dragons as the creator of all things. Io is paired with Chronepsis, who is seen as a re-enfolding that balances Io's extension of being into the worlds. As Io becomes all things, Chronepsis draws them back into himself. They are seen as brothers and represented in a complex symbol involving a nine-headed dragon swallowing  its nine tails. Like Jazirian, Merrshaulk, and Shekinester, Io is an aspect of the World Serpent archetype. 
Io's offspring include Bahamut, Tiamat, Aasterinian, Falazure, and Nathair Sgiathach.
