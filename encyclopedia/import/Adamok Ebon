Adamok Ebon's a Bladeling hunter, born before the magi of her people cast the spell that made them immune to rust (though she's immune now, as all bladelings are). She enjoys hunting for sport in places as diverse as the Forbidden Plateau and the caverns of Ilsensine, but she also takes paying jobs from the likes of Shemeshka the Marauder. She sells corpses to Seamusxanthuszenus and Mhasha Zakk.
