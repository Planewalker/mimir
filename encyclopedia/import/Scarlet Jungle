Cathrys is the second Layer of Carceri, a region of endless, carnivorous jungle. Many Blood War battles have been fought here.
On one famous occasion, a force of mixed Tanar'ri and slaadi badly outnumbered their Baatezu foes, who used the Scarlet Jungle to prevent the chaotic armies from flanking them. Some tanar'ri strategist decided to send troops into the jungle to flank their foes anyway - and the Jungle devoured them.
In another famous battle, a tanar'ri strategist remembered the lesson of the earlier Battle of the Scarlet Jungle and decided not to try to flank the baatezu. This worked much better.
