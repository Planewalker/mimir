This fountain of uncleanliness is a huge pool of grey matter, hundreds of feet across, in the caverns of Mount Voormithadreth.  It is constantly bubbling and putting forth mouths, limbs, psuedopods, and whole creatures.  Some fall back into the pool,  which them grows mouths and devours them.  Shub-Niggurath is intelligent and telepathically sensitive. 
Though its body is trapped deep in the caverns, Shub-Niggurath travels the Prime Material Plane in astral form, using its psionic powers to do evil and aid its worshipers.
