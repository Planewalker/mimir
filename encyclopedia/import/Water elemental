Elemental spirits of currents and waves, water elementals can be as ferocious and powerful as a stormy sea. They resemble vaguely humanoid whirlpools or waves with deep orbs of deep green serving them as eyes. Their arms appear as smaller waves thrust out on either side of their main body; their arms ebb and flow, growing longer or shorter as the elemental moves. Their language, Aquan, sounds like the crashing of the surf in a howling storm.
They are, of course, natives of the Elemental Plane of Water. They're ruled by Istishia. Their vast undersea kingdoms are marked by the lack of any other living thing - if a traveler passing through the plane looks around and doesn't see any fish, it's a sure bet she's in elemental territory. The largest independent kingdom is ruled by Olhydra; Ben-Hadar also has a principality, but it's hidden.
