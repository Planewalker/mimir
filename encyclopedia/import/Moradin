Moradin, also called the Soul Forger and Dwarffather, is the creator Power of the dwarven race and leader of the Morndinsamman. 
It is said that he forged the race from metals and minerals in the fires of the "Heart of the World" and then breathed life into them; it's said he created the world itself from primal chaos. He is the dwarven god of smithing (of all types), stonemasonry, engineering and protection. Dwarves call on him when engaged in these activities. 
He is a dedicated foe of the Orcish+Pantheon and the Goblinoid+Pantheon and their followers, the orcs and goblins. His realm, Erackinor, lies in Mount Celestia's fourth Layer, Solania, and he resides there with his wife, Berronar Truesilver.
