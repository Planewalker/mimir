The mines of Baator's first Layer, Avernus, produce a black-hued ore called arjale. If alloyed with iron, it becomes a light green-grey the color of the skies of Dis. This alloy is dajavva, more commonly known simply as green steel. 
Lighter than normal steel, darjavva can be processed into razor-fine edges, making green steel weapons both faster and more damaging than their standard counterparts. Green steel is not magical.
