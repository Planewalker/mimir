The Boundless is a peculiar Demiplane containing endless crystal strands, spires of spinning vapor, and a gelatinous ocean in which mysterious forms swim. It heals the wounds of any who enter it for the first time, restores  youth and vitality to those who enter it a second time, and permanently traps those who enter it for a third time.
See the Rule+of+Threes.
