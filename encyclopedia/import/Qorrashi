The qorrash (singular: qorrashi) are genies of ice. They are descended from Djinn who traveled to the Paraelemental+Plane of Ice, or vice versa. 
Qorrash are pale blue-skinned creatures of humanoid shape, their bodies covered in frost. Females have long white hair, while males are bald with white goatees. A typical qorrashi is about ten and a half feet tall.
Qorrash are much more martial and organized than their flighty djinni kin.
