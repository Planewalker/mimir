In Aztec mythology, Mictlantecuhtli was the skeletal power of death who
ruled over Mictlan, the underworld, with his wife, Mictanchihuatl. They rule from the ninth and lowest level of the underworld, Tlalxicco.
Like his wife, he is represented as an emaciated human being with a skull-like head, bulging eyes, and claw-fingered hands. He is also depicted as a skeletal canine. The rulers of Mictlan demand a small amount of blood as a component of raise dead spells cast by priests of his mythos.
 The Maztica boxed set says that Mictlan is another name for Niflheim in the Gray Waste.
