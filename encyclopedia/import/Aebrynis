Aebrynis is a world on the Prime Material Plane. The most well-known continent is Cerilia. 
A thousand years ago, give or take, the human gods of Cerilia fought a war which cumulated with the death of the entire pantheon. The blood of the gods fell on the battlefield, turning their mortal champions into a new generation of powers. Divine blood touched other mortals in smaller amounts, giving them and their descendents supernatural powers that the people of Cerilia believe to be a mark of nobility. Only those with divine blood may become kings.
Aebrynis is cut off from the other planes by a plane called the Shadow World, a tainted faerieland something like the Plane+of+Shadow and something like the Seelie and Unseelie Courts.
