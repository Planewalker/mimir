The Daughters of the Light are aÂ Sect opposed to the Revolutionary League and all its doings. They see Anarchists everywhere, and aim to unmask them and put them down.
Their name comes from the idea that they would expose Anarchists with "the light of truth." Members of both sexes are involved with the group, which is based in an old butcher shop in the Clerk's Ward.
After the Faction War, the Daughters expanded their mission to enforce the Lady of Pain's supposed ban on all factions, not just the Revolutionary League.
