The wife and sister of Shu, Tefnut embodies the moisture of the atmosphere. Her power is seen in the wrath of a storm or in the gentle dew found on plants at sunrise. As one might guess, she is sometimes fierce and angry and other times loving and gentle. Villages in need of rain often call upon Tefnut to send her life-giving gift while those in the grip of a great storm plead with her to spare them and turn her attention elsewhere. Tefnut’s true form is that of a slender, attractive woman with the head of a sleek lion. The air around her smells of rain and lightning and her voice is the deep rumble of distant thunder. Omens from Tefnut always come in the form of storms or rain.  
Her Realm of Windwrath can be found on the Layer of Shurrock in Bytopia.
