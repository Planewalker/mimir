Ho Masubi is a member of the Japanese Pantheon and the god of fire.  Izanami died while giving birth to him.  Ho Masubi's father, Izanagi, was so distraught over his wife's death that he chopped the fledgling deity in two.  For that reason, Ho Masubi bears a terrible scar in his true form.
Although destructive by his very nature, the fire god is not evil and does what he can for mankind, providing them with light, warmth, a means of cooking, and the heat for forging weapons and tools. If a village affronts him by neglecting his worship, however, he has been known to burn it to the ground. 
Ho Masubi's realm is Uchi-bi in Pandesmos, on Pandemonium.
