Cernunnos (or Cerunnos) is a shadowy figure, apparently representing the Celts' awe of nature and the unseen supernatural threats that could abide in the forest. He appears as a large man with the antlers, hooves, and legs of a stag; his body is covered with the hair of a stag and he wears a short, full beard.
Cernunnos is the essence of Nature. Like Nature itself he is absolutely neutral, and although intelligent he may sometimes act in what seems to be a mindless manner. He can be as violent as a hurricane or as peaceful as a calm morning in late May. It is his responsibility to maintain Nature's balance. When he rides as master of the Wild Hunt he is influenced by even greater forces and reduced to a single-minded, berserker state.
Cernunnos is druidism, not just a proponent of it. He is as much a part of Nature as the earth itself.
Silvanus may be one of his aspects.
