Agathinon (uh-GATH-uh-non) are shapeshifting Aasimon. In their natural forms they look like elves with opalescent, luminous skin and shining eyes. Male and female agathinon are of equal size and power. They are stern, serious, and  unyielding, devoted to the constant pursuit of right. They are always neutral good. 
Agathinon form the elite vanguard of Celestial armies. When attacking, they shapechange into other forms in order to use their attacks and special powers.  Rarely, they may assume the form of inanimate magic items in order to confer the powers associated with those items to another.
