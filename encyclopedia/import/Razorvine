For the Egyptian deity, see Ra.
One of the few plants that grow in Sigil, razorvine is one of the cruelest in the planes. The beautiful, black, heart-shaped leaves are razor sharp, slicing clothes, skin or even complete fingers off anyone who dares to touch the foliage.
Canny cutters cultivate the stuff outside their homes to protect from any berk who might try to climb their walls.
Razorvine also can be used to create a slightly sour and heady drink called heartwine. The secret to making heartwine is known only to the Cilenei Brothers.
