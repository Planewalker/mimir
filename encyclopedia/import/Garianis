The Garianis family rules the Central+District in the Lower Ward; they're a mafia, an organized group of criminals organized by family under the control of the actual Garianis clan.
They own a number of legal businesses, but it's best not to cross them in the territory they rule, to set up a rival business or to threaten the peace. The Garianis family will bite back. To those who treat them with respect, they can be generous and kind.
The Mercykillers sympathize with their approach toward order, though the Harmonium and Fraternity of Order don't. The Garianis family is headed by Friar Muriov Garianis.
