Godling is a disparaging way to refer to a god, implying it is of little power. It is not a technical term, and has no precise meaning. It's not a Cant term, so it's not really part of Planescape though it may have been used from time to time.
The Athar would not dignify what they call the powers with such an appellation. To them, anything with the word "god" in it is too flattering for what they view as false imposters, deceitful pretenders to true divinity.
