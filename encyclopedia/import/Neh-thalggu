Neh-thalggu, or brain collectors, are entities from the Far Realm. They are looked upon as creatures of legend in their strange home similar to the way dragons are viewed in conventional reality.
As their nickname implies, they spend most of their time collecting brains, which they incorporate into their bodies in order to enhance their powers.
