The planar mancatcher is a mancatcher +2 with the special property of preventing creatures captured by it from teleporting, blinking, shadow walking, phase dooring, ethereal jaunting, planeshifting, or otherwise using magic to move through dimensions. It's standard issue among Harmonium patrols.
You can tell it from regular mancatchers by the mystic runes engraved on it.
