Celadrins are Planetouched descended from Eladrin (usually Firre) and elves who worship Hanali Celanil. During the revels of the summer solstice, firre descend to elven lands and mate with elves in ecstatic rites.&nbsp; The resulting hybrids look like red-haired elves with bronze skin and golden eyes. They have voices that inspire those who hear them with supernatural longing.
