The Five Citadels of Surrender are spaced in the negative Quasielemental Planes. In each one, a traveler gives up a personal quality.
The Great Mine is located on the Quasielemental+Plane+of+Salt. Those who climb down to the column at its nadir give away all fear.
The Embracing Tower is located on the Quasielemental+Plane+of+Ash. It is made of swirling grit, razorvine, and floors of searing cinder. Those who climb the steps find they have lost all hope.
The Invisible Labyrinth is an intangible wisp on the Quasielemental Plane of Vacuum. Those that follow its almost imperceptible currents and bathe in the fountain of nothingness at its center will have lost all compassion.
On the Quasielemental Plane of Dust is a nameless, shifting pattern. Those who loop through the whole thing and return again to the beginning find they've lost all remorse.
The fifth citadel is not named, though it's said to exist on the Negative+Energy+Plane, and that those who go there will have lost all "sorry." It's hard not to draw the conclusion that this is the Fortress of Regrets.
Factol Jeron of the Fraternity of Order is said to have died after exploring all five of the citadels. After losing all five qualities, he apparently no longer had enough of a psyche left to live.
