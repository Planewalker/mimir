Belieren is the third of Elysium's four layers. It's a place of swamps, mainly, as the River Oceanus creates heavy wetlands on this Layer. The Quesar are native to Belieren.
Belieren is also said to contain a terrible secret the guardinals want kept Dark - a fiendish lord or a horrible monster imprisoned in Elysium so that it can't threaten the Multiverse at large. The guardinals have sacrificed an entire layer of their home Plane for the sake of others; what could be more good than that?
For this reason, Belieren is hard for outsiders to get into. The leonals don't like folks peering around.
