Darahl is a god with a long and checkered past, particularly so for a member of the Seldarine. Long ago he was known as Tilvenar, and he served Rillifane Rallathil, but he suffered a loss of power and prestige when an avatar of his was made insane by touching the Kyrashar Rose (a cursed artifact created by Lolth and the Queen+of+Air+and+Dark­ness to hurt and destroy elves). The insanity spread to several of his avatars, and they rampaged through many communities. In time his avatars were dispatched or cured of their affliction, but the damage was done. The elves largely forsook him and his following withered. Eventually he dropped his old name and began to call himself Darahl Firecloak. By "reinventing" himself, he hoped to begin anew among the elves and eventually to reestablish himself. His new realm, in Abellio, is called Twin Towers. 
Darahl is the master of fire- and earth-­based magic and phenomena, and as such has strong ties among gods whose portfolios tie into that. He now consid­ers himself friends with the dwarven deity Dumathoin and several of the gnomish powers (including the halfling god of earth, Urogalan), but at the expense of his friendships among the Seldarine, with whom now he has only a tenuous alliance. However, he's also gained a few new enemies during the course of time. Darahl has not been picky about new converts, so he has tried to sway more neutrally-aligned members of the Underdark races to join with him. This has angered the drow and duergar gods Lolth and Laduguer especially, but he's also gained the unwelcome attention of Kossuth and Selvetarm. It's hard to say who would help him more in a fight, the Seldarine or his new allies, but it isn't something he wants to test just yet.
