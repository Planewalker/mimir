Tony DiTerlizzi is the first (after conceptual artist Dana Knutson) and defining artist of the Planescape line. His drawings put Planescape into a very special mood which seperated the line from other campaign settings.
The main objection people seems to have against the artist is that they seem to ironic and non-fantasy like. While much of his work is done under the pressure of deadlines and large workloads the Planescape community seems unaminous in its support for this artist.
DiTerlizzi illustrated for almost all the core books of Planescape.
His homepage (http://diterlizzi.com) has many examples of his artwork in the Planescape line as well as other projects.
