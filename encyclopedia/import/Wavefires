A wavefire is a boiling wave of elemental water that “swims” through the Plane of Steam. A controversial theory holds that the wavefire is a living relic from an ancient time when the elemental planes were configured differently. It is thought that the Plane of Fire once bordered the Plane of Water, creating a Paraelemental Plane of Steam. This ancient plane is said to be the original home of the wavefires. 
Wavefires don’t interact with other denizens of the plane and feed on dry air, a
scarce resource in a plane of moisture.
