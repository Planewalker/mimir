The principle deity of the Gauls, Teutates (or Touatis) stood for the strength of the tribe. Each tribe had its own patron deity, or its own aspect of Teutates. Teutates is very similar to the Daghdha. 
In avatar form, Teutates appears as a Celtic noble, dressed in the local fashion and armed with gold scale mail, a gold-faces hield and helmet, and a golden sword and spear. His alignment is neutral, and he is concerned with the well-being of the tribe in whose lands the avatar appears. The avatar has the powers of a high-levelÂ  fighter/druid.
