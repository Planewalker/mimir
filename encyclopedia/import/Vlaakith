Vlaakith was the name of the first ruler of the Githyanki after the death of Gith, the rebel leader that united them against the illithids. She was an advisor to Gith and helped seal the pact between red dragons and the githyanki. All subsequent queens of the githyanki have been named after her. The latest queen of the githyanki, Vlaakith CLVII, is a lich and has ruled the githyanki for over a thousand years. Vlaakith CLVI, also a lich, ruled for over 500 years before that before being slain by the first of the Devourer race. Vlaakith's home, the Castle Susurrus, is in the githyanki capital city, Tu'narath, which is built on the god-isle of a deceased power known only as "The One in the Void" in the Astral Plane. 
Recently, Vlaakith has been reported dead-booked after an aborted invasion of the Prime world of Pharagos, though officials from Tu'narath have been quick to deny this.
