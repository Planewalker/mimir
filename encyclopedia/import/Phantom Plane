The Phantom Plane is catalogued as the 7th layer of the+Abyss by the Fraternity of Order. The Tanar'ri call it Kearackinin. 
All portals to the Layer were sealed by its ruler, Sess'innek. It was discovered many centuries ago when a wizard calling himself Mordenkainen managed to temporarily break the seals.
