One group within the Fraternity of Order, the Mathematicians, focuses solely on discovering the Orders of Mechanus itself. After all, the theory goes, Mechanus embodies every law, everywhere in the multiverse. So a full understanding of Mechanus’ laws would allow you to use those discoveries across all planes. In addition, it’s said that somebody that pins down every bit of law about the gears would gain enough insight to rule Mechanus… and from there, the rest of creation shortly afterward. Furthermore, they believe the plane of ultimate law has a “perfect” version of anything else in the universe. So by studying Mechanus, one can find anything one might be desire. Formerly a separate Sect, they have been subsumed into the Bureau of Native Mathematics, a subdivision of the Fraternity of Order.
