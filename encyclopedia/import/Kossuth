Kossuth is the hottest and mightiest of all elementals of fire, the primal power of all flame dwelling in the hottest part of his plane. In Kossuth's palace, even other fire elementals burn.
Kossuth, Tyrant Among Fire, is quick to judge. He expects absolute loyalty and integrity from all who serve him, and overwhelms those who disappoint him with the power of his flames. He teaches survival of the fittest and that flame is purity.
Like other elemental+rulers, Kossuth is alien and enigmatic, with little affection for his mortal worshippers. Unlike the others, though, he actively recruits mortals to his cause, perhaps because they burn out so quickly.
