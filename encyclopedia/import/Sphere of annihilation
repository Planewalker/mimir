A sphere of annihilation is a globe of absolute blackness, a ball of
nothingness 2 feet in diameter. The object is actually a hole in the
continuity of the Multiverse. Any matter that comes in contact with a
sphere is instantly sucked into the void, gone, and utterly destroyed.
Only the direct intervention of a deity can restore an annihilated
character.
The Doomguard have always been fascinated by spheres of annihilation, and as a result they had eight of them hidden in their Damaged or Defective Weapons Storage chamber in the Armory. This had disastrous consequences during the Faction War, when the spheres got loose and destroyed the building. After the war, many of these spheres were moved into Citadel Exhalus, where the locals worship the concept of nothingness.
The Umbral blot is a kind of sentient sphere of annihilation.
