Grid, loveliest of all cloud giantesses, is a powerful sorceress. She is a staunch ally of the Aesir, but still roams freely about Jotunheim, for other giants fear her magic too much to try to hinder her. She is very knowledgeable about the affairs of Jotunheim, and can be counted upon to know when any giantish scheme is afoot.
She is the mother of Vidar by Odin.
