Corellon Larethian is the primary Power of the elven race. He is the creator and preserver of the elves. He governs those things held in the highest esteem among elves, such as magic, music, arts, crafts, poetry, and warfare. Elves and half-elves (as well as many bards) worship him. Corellon favors those who kill orcs (it is said he is the one who took Gruumsh's missing eye) and oppose Lolth and her followers. He blesses those who aid others and despises those who defile the dead or flee from their foes.
He leads a pantheon of gods known as the Seldarine which consists of Corellon Larethian, Aerdrie Faenya, Deep Sashelas, Erevan Ilesere, Fenmarel Mestarine, Hanali Celanil, Labelas Enoreth, Rillifane Rallathil, Sehanine Moonbow, and Solonor Thelandira. Other elven gods may be present in different campaign settings. The Seldarine reside in the Realm of Arvandor on the plane of Arborea. 
Corellon may appear as an elf of either gender often bearing the traditional weapons of the elves, the bow and the sword.
