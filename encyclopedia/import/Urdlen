Urdlen of the Gnomish Pantheon is an intermediate Power of blind destruction, blood, bloodlust, evil, greed, hatred, spriggans, and uncontrolled impulses. It manifests as an enormous blind mole.
Its Realm, called the Worm Realm, is catalogued as the 399th layer of the Abyss. There, Urdlen tunnels through the ground, completely unconcerned with his Petitioners, who dig in the tunnels he leaves behind. The petitioners, mostly evil gnomes, have no society whatsoever; they simply pursue their own greed in the ore-rich earth.
