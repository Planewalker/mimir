Agathion is the fourth layer of Pandemonium, a place of caverns sealed in an infinity of rock with no tunnels to connect them. The powers use Agathion to imprison entities and artifacts that terrify even them. The Lady of Pain once used it to imprison her enemies before she learned the Dark of creating ethereal mazes.
Miska+the+Wolf-Spider and Desayeus are imprisoned on this layer.
