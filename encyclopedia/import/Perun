A Slavic god of creation, justice, life, power, rain, strength, and thunder, Perun is Lawful Neutral. Like Thor, he is the enemy of the World Serpent, whom the Slavs know as Zmiya. He killed the mortal lover of Jurate in punishment for breaking the boundary between the mortal and the divine. He scarred the face of Meness with lightning. His cult is rapidly overshadowing the cult of Ukko.A Slavic god of creation, justice, life, power, rain, strength, and thunder, Perun is Lawful Neutral.
