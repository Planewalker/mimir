Also called by the racial name N'raaigib, smoke paraelementals have independent kingdoms and nobility throughout their plane, ignoring the Mephit ruler Ehkahk. The kingdoms of the smoke mephits and the kingdoms of the smoke paraelementals overlap, so planewalkers traveling through a mephit kingdom might cross the borders of three paraelemental kingdoms, or vice versa. Each smoke paraelemental kingdom is ruled by a powerful king.
The smoke paraelementals are determined to cleanse their plane of the meddling efreet and Djinn.
Physically they look very similar to steam+quasielementals, but much darker in color and opaque. They search their plane for bubbles of air, which they consume, exuding smoke as waste.
