Limbo&nbsp;is the plane of uttermost Chaos, a place where&nbsp;raw&nbsp;elmements unpredictably transform into other elements or spontaneouslycombine to form complex compounds or surreal landscapes. </p>
It's a storm, a soup, a sea,a disaster,&nbsp;and a place of unfathomable creativity. A plane where strange smells are seen, stranger sounds smelled, and brilliant visions both please and terrify the ears and nose it is not.

Anarchs are able to manipulate this chaos-stuff into stable, more familiar terrain, structures and objects. The level of manipulation is dependent on the anarch's skill.
