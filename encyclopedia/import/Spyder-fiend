The spyder-fiends are a subrace of Tanar'ri that serves the Queen of Chaos. Sages speculate that the original spyder-fiends were the spawn of the Queen of Chaos and Miska+the+Wolf-Spider, the queen's lover and general. Most spyder-fiends combine the worst attributes of a wolf and spider. The smallest ones are about the size of ponies; larger variants are as big as heavy warhorses. 
Spyder-fiends are the primary residents of the Steaming Fen, a Layer of the Abyss that consists of a vast salt marsh and a turbulent ocean. The air is thick with biting insects, and both marsh and ocean stink of decay. The ruler of the layer is the Queen of Chaos.
