Ye'Cind is an elven demigod of magical songs and music, primarily worshiped on the world of Oerth. He was a skilled elven wizard and master bard. After a flawless performance in front of the Seldarine, he was granted apotheosis by Corellon Larethian.
One famous myth tells how he unmasked a regicide using his signature artifact, the Recorder of Ye'Cind.
He is allied with the Seldarine, Olidammara and Lydia, but spends most of his time in Brightwater.
