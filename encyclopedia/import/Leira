Leira is the goddess of Deception, Illusion and Mist in Faerun on the Prime world of Toril. She is quite an enigma, she never tells the truth when falsehood would do. Everything she does and says is shrouded in layers of illusion and lies. She believes the truth is worthless and that misbelief and falsehood are what gives life meaning. 
She had quite a small following, her priests, known as Leirans (or worshippers of the mistshadow) wear silver masks, or sometimes disguise themselves to deceive those around them. Leirans are supposed to speak the truth only to other Leirans. High-level clerics of the Leiran faith are called Mistcallers. 
Every morning, and on every moonlit night, Leirans lay face down and pray to the Lady of the Mists. If there is ever mist, Leirans walk through it and pray. The most revered act in the Leiran faith is the Unmasking, a purification ritual performed when new followers enter the religion. 
Shortly after the Time of Troubles, Leira was slain by Cyric with the longsword, Godsbane. Cyric went on to subsume Leira's portfolio and grants spells and powers in her name. 
Some believe Leira is still alive and that she uses her death as a grand illusion, but the general consensus of the few who know any of the Dark concerning her is that she is a dead Power.
Leira's Realm in Limbo was known as the Courts of Illusion.
