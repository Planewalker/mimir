Coggles resemble the great, coglike gears of Mechanus. They move about the Plane at will, adding themselves to the workings of Mechanus here and there for short periods, then moving on. Coggles range in size from only a few hundred feet to almost a mile across. A large one can serve as a transport for an entire battalion of modrons. They may serve other purposes as well, though these are beyond the comprehension of those not native to Mechanus. Coggles can speak and understand the modron tongue.
