Despite its evil connotations, the Wild Hunt is a manifestation of good life force in the lands of the Celts. It appears whenever there is a great force of evil in the area. Wherever the Celtic druids are and wherever they are standing stones that the Wild Hunt can use as beacons, the pack and its master are forever on guard against encroaching evil.
The Wild Hunt appears as a huge pack of magical dogs led by a large, muscular man. The man has dark skin and can either be on foot or at the reins of a two-horse chariot. He carries an enormous spear and wears a metal and leather helmet with antlers. The dogs of the pack are huge beasts, one instant appearing as normal canines and the next as eldritch creatures with green flame coming from their eyes and mouths. When the Wild Hunt approaches, the weather turns for the worst - the winds howl and thunder booms from the heavens. The Wild Hunt fights evil with evil's weapons, fear and ferocity.
