Gorellik is the ancient god of the gnolls, resembling an enormous, savage dire hyena. 
Although only of demigod status now, Gorellik was once much more powerful. The gnolls worshipped him as lord of the hunt, but did not believe he created them. Gorellik has declined since Yeenoghu has stolen away most of the gnolls' worship with powers of greater power. Now he is little more than a beast wandering the lower Planes of Chaos, albeit one of great power.
