Deep Sashelas, called the Sailor's Friend, is the patron god of aquatic elves, who he created from land-elves long ago. Along with a human sea-god, banished Panzuriel from the Material+Plane long ago. He also opposes Aegir and Sekolah.
Deep Sashelas&nbsp;is the de facto leader of the Asathalfinare, and is closely allied with them. He is particularly close to the dolphin goddess Trishina, who is his consort. Other allies include Manannan mac Lir, Poseidon, and Procan.
Deep Sashelas is an unfaithful mate, and has had numerous affairs with mermaids, selkies, aquatic elves, humans and Diancastra, to Trishina's displeasure. 
His Realm, Elavandor, is either in the Sparkling Sea at the edge of Arvandor or somewhere in the Layer of Ossa, depending on his mood. A series of ever-widening caverns near the bottom of the Sparkling Sea always leads to Elavandor, regardless of where it is. Sashelas constantly changes his realm, building and destroying islands, coral reefs, and grottos, and creates sculptures of living coral. Within his realm, any good-aligned elf can breathe water as if it were air.
