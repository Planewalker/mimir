Like the Githzerai and Githyanki, the githvyrik split from their kin when they freed themselves from the illithids.
Unlike the githzerai and githyanki, however, the githvyrik number only
a handful or so, and all of them are so unique that calling them a race
is really more a convenience to reflect their shared origin rather than
a suggestion that they share physical characteristics or a similar
culture. They do not.
