Astral mold is a microscopic organism that can contaminate a Cutter's food rations as they travel the Multiverse. The spores drift freely in the Astral Plane and any who use that plane for travel are potentially vulnerable to it - they can even pass through solid objects to infect perishable goods.
Symptoms of astral mold infection include trouble walking, impaired vision, and debilitated speech. This is followed several hours later by severe muscle convulsions followed by suffocation and death within the day.
