Kesto Brighteyes is a Gnome, an outspoken member of the Athar Faction. He runs a bookshop in the Lower Ward called the Parted Veil, where he is ably assisted by the Bodak Sir Cleve. He summoned Saure using a spell he found in a translated copy of the Book of Inverted Darkness (don't let his possession of dark tomes of utter evil fool you: he's a nice enough guy, just not very reverent; as an Athar, he doesn't believe in blasphemy). His shop - on Forgotten Lane, just a few blocks away from the Shattered Temple - is a good place to go for books of all kinds, both bidden and forbidden. Sometimes Jeena Ealy does signings there.
