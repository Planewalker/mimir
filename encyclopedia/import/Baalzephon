Baalzephon is Minster of Supply in the Dark Eight, in charge of making sure that
the Blood War receives all the equipment, weapons, money, food, and supplies it needs. Without her, the war would come to a halt. She ensures she has the favor of the other Eight through bribery and gifts.
She is the last remaining original member of the Dark Eight, although this is a deadly secret (which is to say, those who find out are killed). Before she got her current job, she was Prime Minister of Dis.
Using the pseudonym "Baalzy," she is worshiped as a god of wealth on the world of Oerth. She is really just a pit fiend, although one of the most powerful of her kind.
