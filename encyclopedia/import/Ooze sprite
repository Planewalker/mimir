Ooze sprites are loathesome piles of muck and goo native to the Paraelemental Plane of Ooze. They're intelligent, well organized, difficult to combat, and potent in their ability to control the minds of others. 
One, an inhabitant of Sigil called Mr. Slur, has managed to take on a vaguely humanoid form. Mr. Slur is the head of a vast criminal organization.
