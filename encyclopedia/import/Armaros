Armaros is an exiled baatezu+noble, also called the Resolver of Enchantments.Â  His exile is largely a matter of politics, not punishment, and despite his exile he is often visited by Asmodeus or his emissaries. Other Lords of the Nine are forbidden to have contact with him in any way for fear he might ally with them, but Armaros is content with this. He desires mostly to be left alone to practice and perfect his magical powers.
It is because of his talent for magic and capacity for innovation that he is potentially too powerful to be permitted into the ranks of the Lords of the Nine, for with the resources of an entire Layer of Baator he might well challenge Asmodeus and win. He's that powerful.
Armaros is still an asset to the Hells, responsible for many of the plane's magical treasures. Due to his long-standing feuds with Adramalech and Phongor, he cannot serve effectively in Nessus, so he has been placed in Avernus. 
He appears as a gray-skinned, bearded, handsome human male with dark gray, leathery batlike wings and two short, forward-thrusting horns on his forehead. His eyes are luminous blue-green.
