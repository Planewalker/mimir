The Incanterium was a major Faction in Sigil some time before the Great Upheaval. They believed that magic was the true nature of the Multiverse, that everything could be understood and controlled magically. The elements, the planes, the gods - all magic. 
How can the Spire be infinite if it has a visible top? Magic.
How does the Lady of Pain control Sigil's portals? Magic.
How does time work? Gravity? Weather? Entropy? Love? They're all magic.
Accordingly, the members of the Incanterium devoted themselves to studying and hording magic of all kinds. They got really good at it, too. They began controlling all the other factions like puppets on a string.
Then, one day, they were gone. The tower they used as their headquarters was gone, too. It was as if they had never been. Most assumed the Lady of Pain had put them in a Maze, and decided it was best to think no more of it. 
Some of the Incanterium survived, though, becoming vampire-like creatures, no longer mortal, surviving the long centuries since their faction's demise by draining magic and spells. This group is known as the Incantifers.
The main traits of an Incantifier are their glowing eyes, which show a shocking truth: The Incantifiers are sustained by magic. Although this gives them long life and resistnce to magic, they now must drain the energy from magic items or spells cast at them. The Incanifiers were introduced in the Planescape Monstrous Compendium Appendix 2, and were expanded on in issue #339 of Dragon Magazine.
