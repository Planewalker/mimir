The psychic wind is the single greatest danger in the Astral Plane. Not Githyanki, not psurlons, not a vacationing Orcus - it's the wind.
It's not real wind, made of air and fallen leaves and such. The Astral Plane doesn't have any air in it. Psychic wind is made of thoughts, dreams, and memories, but it can blow hard.
It's first sensed as a rapid darkening of the silver-gray sky, becoming jet black shot with streaks of indigo. As the sky darkens, the traveller feels its pull - it can get a traveller lost, strand them on the plane for hours, blow them into another plane, or even snap their silver+cords.
