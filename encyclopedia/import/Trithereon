Trithereon is Oerth's intermediate Power of individuality, liberty, retribution, and self-defense. His symbol is the rune of pursuit (like a three-armed swaztika), symbolizing his relentlessness in hunting oppressors and tyrants. 
Trithereon is called the Summoner for his habit of summoning his three guardian animals, Nemoud the Hound, Harms the Falcon, and Carolk the Sea Lizard.
He opposes what he sees as oppressive law, so he often opposes deities of lawful good. He has allies in Apollo and Lathander. His Realm in the first Layer of Arborea is called the Forking Road - it exists as part of every road on the layer, granting visitors a glimpse of the major paths in their lives.
Trithereon is very popular among the Free League.
