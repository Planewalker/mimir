Zegonz is an emaciated, scarred Githzerai with one hand frozen in an unusuable claw. He was maimed by a party of good-aligned adventurers, and he now hates anything having to do with goodness or light.
He's the owner of the Styx+Oarsman tavern in Sigil's Lower Ward. The Tanar'ri value his support of them, and protect him from the Harmonium or others who might try to hurt him or his business.
