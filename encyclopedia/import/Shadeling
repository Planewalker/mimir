The shadelings are bizarre and dangerous denizens of the Plane+of+Shadow.Â  Like dopplegangers, they seek to mimic the forms of their victims and then kill them. First, the shadeling engulfs its victim's shadow, then it takes the victim's material form, duplicating weapons and armor as well. 
In their true forms, shadelings are incorporeal shadows, roughly human-sized by irregularly shaped. Shadelings seem to exist only to duplicate mortals and feed on their shadows. Shadelings are not undead.
