Anshar is a lesser deity of the Babylonian Pantheon. He rules over darkness and night, and is chaotic evil. His Realm in Pandesmos, the City of Eternal Darkness, is shared with the goddess Elo√©le of Aebrynis. It is a great city that covers the walls and ceiling of its gravity-defying cavern; from within, it seems endless, and perhaps it is. It is impossible for light to penetrate the darkness there for more than a few feet. Anshar is served by tall humans gilt in metallic copper, with yellow pupiless eyes, dressed in archaic clothing and speaking tongues now dead and buried.
Anshar always appears as a dark-skinned human and only appears at night or in deep darkness. His animal is the raven. His priests have shaven heads and wear kilts. His holy day is the winter solstice, and he demands sacrifices of precious metals.
Anshar is the grandson of Tiamat. His own son is Anu, who replaced him as head of the pantheon. He personally slew Enki of the Sumerian Pantheon while Nergal held him down.
