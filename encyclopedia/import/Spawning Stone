In a hidden corner of Limbo, the primordial home of the slaadi, the Spawning Stone is located in a realm of their greatest dominion. Each race of slaad converges on the Spawning Stone for a season of mating. The hermaphroditic slaadi mate at the stone in turn, fertilizing each others' internal egg sacs. When the next slaad race in the cycle wrests the Spawning Stone away from the previous group, the slaadi carry around these seedlike fertilized eggs for later implantation into host bodies. Sometimes, however, young slaadi are produced right there at the stone because the slaadi implant each other in their mating frenzy. Thus, dead adult slaadi routinely float about the stone until destroyed by the chaos of Limbo. Though the stone drifts from place to place, currents of chaos-stuff always flow away from the stone. Slaadi can recognize these currents and follow them “upstream.” The currents grow into tsunamis and give birth to chaos storms when the stone changes hands among the slaadi. One death slaad guards the Spawning Stone at all times against potential nonslaad visitors. This sentinel, called the Guardian of the Stone, is a 45 HD death slaad who has several levels of fighter and sorcerer. The slaadi believe that wresting control of the stone from the Guardian allows the victor to be reborn as a death slaad with the powers of an Anarch. The level of control possessed by the anarch can bring into being buildings, vegetation, and animals—an entire ecosystem, if desired.
