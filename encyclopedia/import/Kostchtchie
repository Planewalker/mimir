Kostchtchie (ko'-shiey) was once a deformed human whose soul was hidden by Baba Yaga, making him invulnerable to death. When his soul was finally destroyed, it fell into the Abyss, where Kostchtchie slowly evolved to the status of Abyssal+lord. He is called the Prince of Wrath. He despises his human origins and would rather think of himself as a giant.
Kostchtchie rules the 23rd layer of the Abyss, called the Iron (or sometimes the Icy) Wastes, though the ratatosks and worshipers of the Norse Pantheon call it Rime Thuras. This layer touches Yggdrasil and contains portals to Lolth's web and Thrym's realm. He is worshipped by frost giants and particularly brutal tribes of humanoid or ogre barbarians. Kostchtchie wishes force all frost giants to bow down to him, forsaking Thrym and the other gods of the Giant Pantheon.
