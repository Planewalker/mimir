Shar[/b] is the Neutral Evil Greater goddess of darkness, night, loss, forgetfulness, unrevealed secrets, caverns, dungeons, and the underdark.  Along with her good sister and enemy Sel√ªne, Shar is one of the two oldest Torilian goddesses.
Her Realm is called the Palace of Loss, and it is a single tower without windows or doors. No one can figure out how they do it, but her Petitioners come and go as they please, excepting those who feel the loss of freedom the most keenly. Those are locked inside. It lies in Niflheim, the second gloom of the Gray Waste, although some sources place her in the Plane+of+Shadow.
