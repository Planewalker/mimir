Psurlons are wormlike creatures with formidable mental powers. They originated on a world on the Prime Material Plane that they destroyed through their own hubris, but now can be found primarily on the Astral Plane. They have long, tubular, pinkish bodies marked with faint rings; they have two arms and legs, each of which also looks like a giant earthworm. They wear rich robes, and dwell in citadels similar to those of the Githyanki. On the Astral Plane they are the githyanki's greatest rivals, making three races out to destroy the 'yanki (along with illithids and Githzerai).


Average psurlons perform all day-to-day tasks related to keeping a cluster running smoothly. 
Elder psurlons are leaders within their communities. 
Giant psurlons are bred for combat; their mental powers are more formidable than their physical abilities.

Many psurlons have become interested in the world of Athas, where they apparently hope to repeat the psionic experiment that destroyed their homeworld. Psurlons are worshippers of Mak Thuum Ngatha, and perhaps that explains everything.
