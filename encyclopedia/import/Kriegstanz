Kriegstanz, or war-dance, refers to the cold war between the planar factions, the complex "dance" of competing philosophies that cumulated in the Faction War. 
After the war, the Kriegstanz still goes on, on an even broader scale than before, but the factions have learned a lesson about bringing devastation to Sigil.
