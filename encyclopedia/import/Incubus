An incubus is the male counterpart of the Succubus.Â  They are wingless and athletic, with pale hairless skin, long twisted horns, and cloven hooves. They are the physical manifestations of abominable male lusts - they take what they want by force. They are aggressive soldiers, many of them serving in the armies of Malcanthet. Their kisses steal wisdom from their victims.
