Garm is a huge dog with a disproportionately large head. He guards the entrance to the cavern Gniper, where Helvig, the long and troublesome road to Niflheim, begins. Garm will allow any being to enter Gniper, but will not willingly allow them to leave.
When his mistress, Hel, is out collecting the dead and Helvig is closed, Garm is allowed to roam freely. He can travel to any Layer of Ysgard freely, taking with him a pack of dire wolves for company.
Over the centuries, Garm has fought and killed many heroes who went to Niflheim in an attempt to retrieve their loved ones. There is quite a collection of magic swords, armor, and other items in Gniper.
