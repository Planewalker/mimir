Furcas is the Minister of Mortal Relations in the Dark Eight. He is in charge of those who tempt and seduce mortals. Being one of the oldest of the Dark Eight, he knows the secrets of his rivals, and doesn't hesitate to control them through blackmail and extortion. He formally worked for Dispater before ascending to his current office.
The latest chant is that he's dead, replaced by a younger pit fiend using his name.
