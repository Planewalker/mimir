Duskur is an enigmatic and mysterious she-devil, sometimes called “The Dark Lady.” She roams the wastes of Avernus accompanied by the skeleton and zombie armies she has raised, having spurned more than one archdevil who offered her his hand (Geryon and Belial are known to have been among her rejected suitors), and chosen to have no mate instead.
Duskur appears as a winged but otherwise normal human female of thin, shapely form and graceful movements. Her flesh is snow-white, her eyes black pools — iris, pupils, and all a glistening black — and her hair long and black. Her wings are smoky-grey and white, leathery rather than feathered, and she usually wears a long, sweeping hooded cloak over them unless actually in flight. She is said to sometimes sing to herself in a beautiful fluting, high voice, but she bears no musical instrument or any love for the music of others. Her kiss causes her foes to fall asleep.
