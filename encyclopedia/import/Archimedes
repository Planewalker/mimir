Archimedes is a fallen Solar who now dwells in Maladomini, the seventh of Baator's nine hells.
The solar may have fallen from the perfect grace he experienced in his native plane, Elysium, but he's still very much a force for Good. He simply believes he has to dirty himself to survive in Baator and continue to outsmart the Baatezu day after day. He offers hope to those who dare to defy the baatezu, gathering exiles and prisoners of the plane to himself in his secret place in one of Triel's abandoned cities.
