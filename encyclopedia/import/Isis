One of the most prominent members of the Great Ennead (the Egyptian Pantheon), Isis is the Power of magic, as well as motherhood, and is the ideal for all Egyptian women. She is daughter of Geb and Nut, the wife of Osiris, and the mother of Horus.
She introduced the custom of marriage to the Egyptian people and has served as the ruler of the Realm of Heliopolis in the past. She was responsible for the transformation of her husband into a god of the dead.
Her true form is that of a tall and beautiful woman of classical nature. She has green eyes that dance with mystical highlights, and a soothing voice.
Isis is a regal and noble deity who is eager to share the knowledge of the gods with humanity and often goes to great lengths to introduce her worshipers to new concepts and ideas. In many cases, these new ideas take the form of magic spells and enchantments. 
Although Isis primarily resides in Heliopolis, she has a secondary Realm, Quietude, in Elysium's first Layer of Amoria.
