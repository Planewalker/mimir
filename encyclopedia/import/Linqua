Linquas are the servants of the Chinese thief-god, Sung Chiang. They're somewhere between (evil) Aasimon and constructs in nature; although not individually strong, they each contain a tiny spark of Sung Chiang's divinity, something they find dangerously addictive. Linquas banished from Sung Chiang's presence will do anything to feel that spark again.
Although they're not mechanical like modrons, the artificial nature of linquas is apparent from their appearance, which is boxlike and inorganic despite their wide eyes and spotted, furry bodies. They only feel real when divine energy flows through them.
