Yeth hounds are doglike hunters given to the faithful of Lower Planar powers. Once in service of a powerful and fearless master, the hounds hunt humans, demihumans, and fey nightly. Hounds without a master often join into packs where they hunt on their own. Yeth hounds resemble black canine creatures about five feet tall.
 They are capable of emitting a piercing howl that terrifies most prey they come upon. For this reason, most yeth hounds are in the service of Tanar'ri, yugoloths, or other creatures immune to fear.
