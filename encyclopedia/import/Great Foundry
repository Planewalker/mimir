The Great Foundry is located in Sigil, in the Lower Ward. It is the primary location in the city for metalwork including the forging of weapons and armor. The Foundry is responsible for much of the air 'quality' in that ward, as it produces a great deal of smoke and soot. Prior to Faction War it was operated by the Godsmen faction.
Since Faction War the Foundry is operated by bladelings.
