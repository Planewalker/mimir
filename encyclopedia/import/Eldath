Eldath is the goddess of peace, springs, and quiet places in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting. She is one of the gods who serves Silvanus, along with Mielikki, who Eldath considers a good friend. Her other allies include Chauntea, Lathander, Sarula Iliene, and Selune. While Tempus is the opposite of everything Eldath stands for, and vice versa, the two respect each other's conviction. Eldath's clergy often live together in small forest communites where they tend to unspoiled groves, which also serve as places of worship.
Her Realm in Eronia, Elysium is called the True Grove. It is marked by a ring of tall oaks surrounding a spring.
