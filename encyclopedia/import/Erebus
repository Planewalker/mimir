Erebus, the Void Between the Stars, is a lesser deity related to the Olympian+Pantheon. His other titles include King of Shadows, Devourer of the Light, and Lord of Darkness.
He was one of the first of all gods, the son of Chaos and brother of Eros, Gaea, Tartarus, and Nyx . His children with Nyx include Charon. His Realm was the Prime Material Plane when it was nothing but vast emptiness. He took offense at the creation of the worlds, relocating in disgust to the Plane+of+Shadow. He aspires to bring about the fall of all other gods and every mortal race, bringing back the emptiness of pre-creation. 
Erebus is served by Dark ones, darkweavers, nightshades, Shadar-kai, shades, shadows, shadow+demons, and shadow+dragons.
