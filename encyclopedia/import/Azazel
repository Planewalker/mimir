Azazel is an exiled baatezu+noble known as the Serpent. He considers all Baatezu other than Asmodeus, Mephistopheles, Baalzebul, and for some reason Adramalech to be of lesser worth than himself, and for this pride he was thrown out of two successive dukedoms, despite being an able general and a master strategist. 
Azazel appears as a winged, emerald-green, scaled humanoid with broad wings and a snakelike head. He wears rich garments incorporating fur and gold braid, and gaudy oversized jewelry. He spends much of his time planning schemes to take control of Avernus.
