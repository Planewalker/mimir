Although he is of Yugoloth origin, Xengahra closely resembles a Solar. He was made that way by a coven of Night Hags. After his contract with them expired, Xengahra slew them all, forcing him to flee to the Outlands. 
Some call him the Fallen One. He is death and despair incarnate, much admired by the Doomguard and the Bleak Cabal. He is no longer as evil as his kin.
