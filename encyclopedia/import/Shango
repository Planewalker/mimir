An African deity, Shango is the storm god of the Yoruba tribe of Nigeria. He can kill people by breathing fire from his mouth. This is how he shows his anger, and sacrifice must be made to appease him. The ram is sacred to Shango. He appears as a heavily-muscled African man, and carries a “Thunder-Axe.”
