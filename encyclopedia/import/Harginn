Harginns, or flame horrors, are grues native to the Elemental+Plane+of+Fire. They typically appear like humans with flames where their lower bodies and legs would be, as bronze-skinned humans, or as bonfires. Their features express leering evil and ruelty. Their eyes are glowing black, and their bodies are all of the colors of flame. They attack by firing gouts of flame from their fingertips, and can blink at will.
Harginns are organized into loose guilds on their home plane, their society a mutinous meritocracy. Female harginns belong to the scout, shepherd, gatherer, weaver and hunter guilds, while males belong to the farmer, soldier, cook, scribe, and priest guilds. Either gender an be in the pariah guild, responsible for burning waste, fetching water (for clients, not for themselves) and other hated tasks.
There are also clans of harginn pirates, who sail ships across the burning seas of Fire, raiding non-efreeti settlements and selling their captives as slaves to the efreet. Of non-efreet, the Azer get along with harginn pirates the best, as they are willing to pay the harginns tribute promptly and without complaint. Thus, azer ships are considered safe from piracy. In these clans, females fish the seas of flame, while males are sailors and marines.
Most harginn are servants and lackeys of the efreet. Everywhere but the City of Brass, they are nomads. When killed, they leave behind a Spell object that contains a single spell suitable for copying into a spellbook.A harginn can be summoned with a summon monster IV spell.
