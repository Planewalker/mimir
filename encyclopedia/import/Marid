Marids are huge, powerful genies of water, strong-willed and independent. Their skin is the color of the ocean (normally blue or green, though the most powerful have skins the pink, white, or black of pearls), growing darker with their tempers. Their hair is normally black, but white-haired marids are not unheard of. In the sea they often go nude, though on land they enjoy flashy clothing. 
Marids are egotistical, though in their case this egotism is justified. They're whimsical and inconstant in nature, brilliant story-tellers and inveterate liars. They are beyond good or evil.
All marids claim at least some petty nobility. Their capital is the Citadel of Ten Thousand Pearls, where they are ruled by a great padisha.  They treat all others as inferiors; they tolerate the Djinn and Jann, but dislike efreet and Dao; they feel the latter two do not know their proper places.
