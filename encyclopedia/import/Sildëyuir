SildÃ«yuir is a Demiplane, coterminous to the world of Toril. It's populated by a rare race called star elves. The demiplane is small, only a few hundred miles from one side to the other, and covered in forest. some of this forest has been blighted by Nilshai sorcery.
Time passes at only half the speed here that it does on most other planes of the Multiverse.
