Elishar is an intermediate deity of the Positive+Energy+Plane, part of a dualistic religion called Following the Light. Elishar appears as a humanoid being (of any gender), as a pulsating globe of light, or as a ravid. It opposes Toldoth, who personifies negative energy, in all things.
Elishar is worshiped on a world currently being invaded by the minions of Lolth, who are slowly covering it with a mysterious red forest.
