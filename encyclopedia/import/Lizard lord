The Lizard Lord is the patron of lizards, one of the many Animal Lords in the Beastlands. His human shape is that of a human male with rough skin, and in his animal form, he wears the shape of a large lizard, like a komodo dragon. He is known to rarely appear in human form and almost never involves himself with the affairs of those who aren't lizards. He usually stays in a topor, but can be very vengeful when he rises to protect his kind.
