The most virulent disease in the Outer Planes is the pox. Supposedly, the pox was created by the yugoloth+lord Anthraxus as a means of getting back at Mydianchlarus, or simply as an afterthought. Others claim it was created by the Dark Eight as a weapon against the Tanar'ri. Either way, it affects everyone and everything now. Anyone touched by an infected carrier can contract the plague.
Early symptoms resemble the common cold or flu. The second stage is marked by high fever, fatigue, muscle pain, and vomiting. A day later, pustular pimples begin forming on the victim's body. At that point, the victim is incapacitated and death comes in 2-12 hours later as puss fills the Sod's body with lethal toxin.
