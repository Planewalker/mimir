Neumannus is a Créche-forge, a factory dedicated to the production and "recycling" of inevitables. It takes up a small (900' diameter) cog on the Plane of Mechanus. Tall smokestacks cover both sides of the cog and constantly belch sooty clouds from the raging fires of its forges and furnaces.
Inside, there is chamber after chamber of crystal molds into which liquid silver and gold are poured (by special constructs) to make the dizzying variety of inevitable components. These components are assembled and animated in oily arcane baths. New or recycled inevitables are soon ready to be dispatched throughout the planes to fulfill their preprogrammed tasks. These tasks are encoded on the inevitable in glowing runes handed down by the Hub of Elders.
Certain corrupted inevitables who refuse to get their memories purged are still drawn irresistably to the créche-forge of their birth. Some use this access to allow living visitors access to the mold chambers through secret "back doors." There, biological lifeforms can be subtly modified with machine features, for a fee.
