The Vile Hunt is a Sect who believe that the Multiverse was made for humanoids to better themselves and that other lesser entities, especially animal Petitioners and animaloids,Â are abominations to be hunted down and put in the Dead-book. They operate mostly around Faunel, but may be found on safari in the Beastlands. They are opposed by the Verdant Guild for obvious reasons.
