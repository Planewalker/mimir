Esmus, like Tollysalmon and Lhar, is an ex-Factol of the Bleak Cabal, currently in the Criminally and Irretrievably Insane of the Gatehouse thanks to the Grim Retreat, the madness that afflicts Bleakers like cats afflict rats. Somehow, his madness has gifted him with mental powers that it's said the Bleakers can't kill him, not that they haven't tried.
