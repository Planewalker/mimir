Tymora, goddess of good fortune, is a deity known mostly on Faerun. She is one half of the ancient Greek goddess Tyche; the other half is her twin sister, Beshaba, goddess of ill fortune. She is an intermediate deity, and chaotic good in Alignment.
Her divine Realm is in Brightwater, where she dwells in the Quarter of the Great Wheel. Gambling, racing, and games of chance are common here, as are trials by fire and other ordeals, with heavy betting on the sidelines. The streets are broad and well kept, with many fine archways and large marble blocks at street corners for orators and bettors.
