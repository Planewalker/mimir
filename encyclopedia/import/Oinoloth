The Oinoloth is the master of Khin-Oin, the Wasting Tower, the second-most potent lord of the Yugoloth race after the General of Gehenna. 
Until recently the Oinoloth was Anthraxus, a ultroloth whose head was shaped into that of a diseased ram by a blasphemous pact. The ultroloth Mydianchlarus whispered a secret into his ear so disturbing that it compelled Anthraxus to abandon his throne, allowing Mydianchlarus to take on the role of Oinoloth himself.
