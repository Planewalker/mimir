Tuonetar is the Finnish goddess of the underworld, the wife of Tuoni. An incredibly ugly, terrifying crone, she is chaotic evil. She dwells with her husband in Pandesmos, one of the layers of Pandemonium. Their realm is an underworld called Tuonela. 
Tuonela is ringed by the river Manala, which flows into the Styx. The waters of the Manala are crimson with black swells of wave; those who drink or touch it are drained of all desire, so that they can neither fight, eat, nor see any purpose in living. Tuonela is a grim realm of those living and dead who have drunk of the Manala's water, ruled from a great black house where Tuonetar and Tuoni live, occasionally hosting their many daughters, who include Kiputytt√∂ and Loviatar.
