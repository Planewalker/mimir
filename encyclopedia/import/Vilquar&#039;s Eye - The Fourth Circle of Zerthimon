The Fourth Circle of Zerthimon - Vilquar's Eye

*Know* that
        the Rising of the People against the *Illithid* was a thing built upon
        many ten-turnings of labor. Many of the People were gathered and taught
        in secret the ways of defeating their *illithid* masters. They were taught
        to shield their minds, and use them as weapons. They were taught the scripture
        of steel, and most importantly, they were given the *knowing* of freedom.
      Some of the
        People learned the nature of freedom and took it into their hearts. The
        *knowing* gave them strength. Others feared freedom and kept silent. But
        there were those that *knew* freedom and *knew* slavery, and it was their
        choice that the People remain chained. One of these was Vilquar.
      Vilquar saw
        no *freedom* in the Rising, but opportunity. He saw that the *illithid*
        had spawned across many of the False+Worlds. Their Worlds numbered so
        many that their vision was turned only outwards, to all they did not already
        touch. Vilquar's eye saw that much took place that the *illithid* did
        not see. To the Rising, the *illithid* were blinded.
      Vilquar came
        before his master, the *illithid* Zhijitaris, with the *knowing* of the
        Rising. Vilquar added to his chains and offered to be their eyes against
        the Rising. In exchange, Vilquar asked that he be rewarded for his service.
        The *illithid* agreed to his contract. 
      At the bonding
        of the contract, a dark time occurred. Many were betrayals Vilquar committed
        and many were the People that the *illithids* fed upon to stem the Rising.
        It seemed that the Rising would die before it could occur, and the *illithid*
        were pleased with Vilquar's eye.
      It was near
        the end of this dark time when Zerthimon came to *know* Vilquar's treacheries.
        In *knowing* Vilquar's eye, Zerthimon forced the Rising to silence itself,
        so that Vilquar might think at last his treacheries had succeeded, and
        the Rising had fallen. He *knew* that Vilquar's eye was filled only with
        the reward he had been promised. He would see what he wished to see.
      With greed
        beating in his heart, Vilquar came upon the *illithid* Zhijitaris and
        spoke to his master of his success. He said that the Rising had fallen,
        and the *illithids* were safe to turn their eyes outwards once more. He
        praised their wisdom in using Vilquar's eye, and he asked them for his
        reward.
      In his greed-blindness,
        Vilquar had forgotten the *knowing* of why the People had sought freedom.
        He had lost the *knowing* of what slavery meant. He had forgotten what
        his *illithid* masters saw when they looked upon him. And so Vilquar's
        betrayal of the People was ended with another betrayal. Vilquar came to
        *know* that when Vilquar's eye has nothing left to see, Vilquar's eye
        is useless. 
      The *illithid*
        gave to Vilquar his reward, opening the cavity of his skull and devouring
        his brain. Vilquar's corpse was cast upon the Fields of Husks so its blood
        might water the poison-stemmed grasses.
