Pentar was Factol of the Doomguard prior to the Faction War, and was a young, enthusiastic believer that in all things, Entropy should be sped up, aided, helped along in its quest towards ultimate destructions. She believed totally in nothing short of the complete annihilation of the Great Modron March. She had begun letting her attention to be drawn away from Sigil, letting the Cambion Ely Cromlich oversee much of the day-to-day activities of the Doomguard headquarters in Sigil, the Armory. She was mazed by The+Lady+of+Pain during the Faction War.Â
