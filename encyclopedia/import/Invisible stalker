Invisible stalkers (or the sshai, as they call themselves1) are natives of the Elemental Plane of Air2. When encountered elsewhere, they've usually been summoned to fulfill a specific task, usually hunting and killing some conjurer's foes. The sshai hate being enslaved in this way, and seek to pervert the intent of their commands if they're kept from their homelands for too long.3 In their true form they resemble roiling clouds of vapor, but they are normally invisible.2
On their home plane, they live without malice or violence as wise sages and lorekeepers in the cities of the Djinn.4
