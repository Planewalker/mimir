Giftcraft items are created by the Githyanki. Githcraft weapons always look distinctive and more than a little menacing. A single weapon might combine decorative features, such as a serrated edge and baroque elements, in a somewhat organic style. During the forging process, every githcraft weapon is given a name of great power and promise. 
A particular suit of githcraft armor might be decorated with spikes, baroque elements, and components of other types of armor, all mixed together in a unique style of its own.
