Bedlam is the Gate-town to Pandemonium. Perhaps madness runs downhill; that would explain why most of the Burg's barmies dwell on the lower slopes of Maraush, the volcanic hill on which Bedlam is built. In the maddest sections, the walls are strangely curved and seem to defy space and time. 'Course, most think Bedlam's ruler, Tharick Bleakshadow, is the barmiest of them all.
The Portal to Pandemonium is in a great tower at the hill's base, which is capped with something that looks like a gigantic human hand - perhaps, some say, the petrified remains of a god who tried to escape the Howling Plane and failed.
The people of Bedlam - humans, bugbears, gnolls, tieflings, githzerai, and others - are by and large as mad as those of Xaos, but more petty and hateful. Unlike the people of zoaS, they don't enjoy being mad. The Bleak Cabal is very influential in this town, as is a sinister Shadow demon who seems to lurk in every shadow, in every addled mind.
