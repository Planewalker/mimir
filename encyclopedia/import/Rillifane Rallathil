Rillifane Rallathil is a chaotic good elven god of druids, nature, wild elves, wood elves, and the woodlands. He is chaotic good. He is, at the same time, a gigantic ethereal oak tree whose roots merge with every plant in the worlds, and a bark-skinned elflike god living in Arvandor with the rest of the Seldarine. 
Rillifane is closely allied with Emmantiensien, the god of treants. The two tree-gods engage in slow, seemingly endless conversations when the Seelie+Court comes to Arvandor or Rillifane visits the Court (where he is always welcome). He is closely allied with most of the Seldarine, but opposes Solonor Thelandira, the elven god of hunting and archery, who hunts for sport - Rillifane detests this practice.
