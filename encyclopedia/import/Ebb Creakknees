Ebb Creakknees[/b]
An old Harmonium member who seems to be content enough to sit in
his chair at the Smoldering+Corpse and run his mouth off to whomever
will listen to him. He's a font of information, if you can get past all
the long-winded explanations.
Aside from his persona as a retired guard and Tout, he is found to be a supporter of the Anarchist Faction.
