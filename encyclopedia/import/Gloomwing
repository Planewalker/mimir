The gloomwing is a large, mothlike creature native to the Plane+of+Shadow. It is the adult stage of the tenebrous+worm. </p>
Their bodies and wings are covered with
  shimmering, geometric patterns of black and silver. They can cause magical confusion with these patterns, and they have a special pheremone that drains strength from their victims.
