Veshvoriak is a dead obyrith+lord that's
frozen in a glacial rift in the Iron+Wastes (Kostchtchie's realm). He's
about 600 feet long, and although he's dead, his mind still works and
infects any who draw near with memories and murder from the primal time
when Veshvoriak was still alive. It's from this body that Kostchtchie
learned about Obox-ob, and of Obox-ob's goals of reclaiming the title
of Prince of Demons.
