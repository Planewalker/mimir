Helm, known in Zakhara as Helam, is a lawful neutral intermediate god of guardians, guardianship, protection, and protectors.
His Realm in Mechanus is called Everwatch. Any time a visitor enters the wheel on which it is located, no matter the direction, they encounter a watchtower manned by a forbidding guardian covered head to toe in mithral plate armor. This guardian, whose name and nature are unknown, unfailingly detects alignment and determines a visitor's reason for entering the realm. It can call hosts of Aasimon in an instant in case of any invasion.
