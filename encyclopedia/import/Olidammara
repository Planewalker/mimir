Olidammara is one of the more eccentric of the of the powers of Oerth.
The Laughing Rogue is often involved in good-natured schemes involving
the other gods (less good-natured for the more evil deities), with
repercussions that can make life difficult for his faithful. He has few
proper priests, but is held in high regard in almost all non-evil
regions of the Flanaess. He sponsored the apotheosis of the demigoddess Rudd, and was briefly imprisoned by the mad wizard Zagyg. His sister is Scahrossar, Mistress of Exquisite Pain, but the two deities have nothing to do with each other and only the most obscure religious texts mention their relationship.
His home+plane is Ysgard. His Realm is called the Den of Olidammara.
