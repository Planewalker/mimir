Cegilune[/b] is queen of the Night Hags, and the patronÂ Power of hags in general. She manifests as a hideous old woman stirring a cauldron which is also the moon. 
She is connected somehow to Titania, Queen of the Seelie Faerie Court; Cegilune is her dark aspect or perhaps her sister.
Her Realm is Hagsend and can be found on the Gray Waste's third Layer of Pluton.
