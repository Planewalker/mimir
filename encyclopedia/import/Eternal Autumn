This Demiplane is an autumnal forest of seemingly infinite extent. Visitors appear in the sky and can fall forever unless they slow themselves down, at which point the ground manifests. Falling on this plane happens at 1000 feet per round regardless of Material+Plane physics.
The Eternal Autumn Woods are inhabited by ochre jellies, flail snails, garbugs, a farastu Gehreleth, grippli, a red dragon, gargoyles, ogres, trolls, a greenhag, and Hordling-like creatures created by an artifact.
