Djinn blossoms resemble large ferns with branches like that of a rose emerging from the fronds. On the Elemental Plane of Air these can grow the size of islands, and indeed often form the base of the floating islands of the plane. On the Prime Material Plane they are smaller, usually only five feet in diameter. Regardless of where they are, a light breeze surrounds them. Their blossoms smell like lilacs.
If djinn blossoms are not regularly trimmed, they will planeshift automatically to the elemental plane from which they came.
