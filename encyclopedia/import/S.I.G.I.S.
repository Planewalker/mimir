S.I.G.I.S. (Sigil's Independent Global Information Service) was a fanzine produced by Mimir.net's John Winter and edited by Scott Kelly in the mid and late 90's. Its pages were filled with stories about life in Sigil and among the planes, written by Planescape fans in the style of a 'weekly newsrag.' Included amongst the stories were advertisements, want ads and fan created art to go along with the newrag's articles. S.I.G.I.S.'s 33 issues can be found in Planewalker.com's Mazed Archives.
