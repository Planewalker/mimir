Vafthrudnir is an incredibly old, wise, and evil frost giant wizard/druid who lives alone deep in the wastes of Jotunheim. There, he spends time reading ancient tomes. As his knowledge is renowned, many other beings attempt to gain fame by striving against him in wisdom. The contest is based on questioning, with Vafthrudnir asking all his questions first; if one question goes unanswered, the challenger loses his life! None have ever beaten him, or even been able to answer enough questions to take a turn of their own.
