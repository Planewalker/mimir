Siva should not to be mistaken for the Hindu god “Shiva the Destroyer,” which is a composite of many older gods. Siva is such an important manifestation of Rudra (the destructive god of storms and diseases) that he can be regarded as a separate Vedic Power. Siva is power incarnate, a fierce ascetic who repeatedly brings the world to the brink of annihilation by dancing in fire. He is the negative force of the cosmos, destroying whatever he touches in order that it may be reincorporated into unity with the spirit of the cosmos. Anything that Siva touches is utterly annihilated and can never be reconstructed, raised, or reincarnated. In his true form, Siva is a man with four arms and three eyes, usually wearing a tiger skin and a snake collar.
Though determined to destroy all of existence, Siva does not consider himself evil. He is merely attempting to return everything to unity with the cosmic spirit. He is an impersonal god who seldom answers prayers, but he occasionally sends his avatar to defend one of his temples.
He resides in a realm in the Negative+Energy+Plane called the Vortex. 
Siva is extremely popular among the Doomguard, who see a kindred spirit - committed to multiversal dissolution, but in no hurry to rush the timeline.
