Yetsirah is the capital of Mount Celestia, the counterpart of Malsheem. It's located in the sixth heaven, Jovar.
The city's shaped like a seven-tiered ziggurat (though it's not clear if this is the same as the infinite ziggurat rumored to exist somewhere on the layer). Yetsirah exists to embody the union of justice and mercy, and to provide access to the highest heaven, Chronia.
