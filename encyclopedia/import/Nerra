The nerra are natives of the Plane+of+Mirrors. They resemble humanoids with skin that shines with a perfectly smooth, mirrorlike surface. 
The nerra have three castes: the kalareems are bulky and muscular warriors (but stealthy and graceful at the same time). The robed sillits are the leaders, planners, and schemers. The varoots are the spies and sabateurs.</p>
