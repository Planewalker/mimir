Stalker is a primal creature related to all goblinkind, a
terrible miscarriage jealous at its siblings for the lives it could
never live. When the first goblinkin entered a cave, Stalker was there,
furious at the intrusion. It manifests as a cold shadow that drains the
life from those who touch it.
