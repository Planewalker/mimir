Dunatis, the Far Seeing, is a lesser god of mountains and peaks in the Celtic Pantheon. He appears as a normal man with an aura of divine power. His main attribute is the power to raise a mountain peak from a flat plain or flatten a giant mountain into a prairie, instantaneously.
Dunatis dwells on a vast mountain, known as the Pinnacle, on the fringe of Tir na Og. He claims to have created the infinite Spire in the center of the Outlands, and is revered by some of the Rilmani who dwell there. He is the most approachable of the Celtic gods.
