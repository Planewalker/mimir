Kiaransalee was the mortal queen of a world called Threnody at least 30,000 years in the past. After killing everyone on the planet, she became a demigoddess, ruling a realm in the Abyss. At some point she was slighted by Orcus, though no one but her remembers the details.
Later on, the goddess Lolth fell into the Abyss as well, and captured Kiaransalee in her twisted web. For millennia, Kiaransalee labored under Lolth's spidery shadow as the goddess of undeath and vegeance.
When the time seemed right, she ambushed Orcus in his own layer, slaying him with a surge of negative energy. Though Orcus was more powerful, he had grown complacent, and she cast his corpse into the Astral Plane. 
Recently Orcus has returned, retaking Thanatos, the layer Kiaransalee had made her own. Returning to Lolth's demonweb, she once again seeks revenge. Currently she lairs in the fortress of Kandelspire on the Prime world of Guldor, which was conquered by Lolth some decades ago.
