Oridi Malefin, a Tiefling cleric of the Abstract Concept of Death, and Factol of the Dustmen. Outside of (the now mazed) Factol Skall himself, Oridi was for many years seen as the spiritual leader of the Faction, even outside of her position as Factor and High Priestess of the Dustmen. Because of this, she quickly assumed the mantle of Factol upon the end of the Faction War.
Malefin's tiefling heritage expresses itself as a long, scaly tail and a third eye situated in the center of her forehead. This strikes others less so than the fact that she's at least 200 years old, and between her gault, pale features, hollow, haunting voice, and her eternally patient outlook she frankly seems more dead than many of the actual undead that populate the Mortuary.
Prior to the Faction War, Oridi was of the mind that she would likely reach the state of True Death within several decades. And in fact she had been prolonging her own life, effectively stalling it at her current stage in order to more fully experience the transition towards True Death, and also to shepherd the Faction members towards the same eventual goal. Given her position of power as Factol, and her newfound responsibilities in that capacity, her estimated timeframe leading up to True Death may have expanded indefinitely.
