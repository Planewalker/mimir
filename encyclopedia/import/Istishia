Istishia is the God-King of water Elementals (some say she's their queen). He is truly immense, spanning a sea or more. Of all the water elementals, Istishia is the most powerful and pure, embodying water in all its aspects.
Istishia sees himself as the great equalizer, the element that overwhelms air, erodes stone, and extinguishes fire. Istishia knows the task is long, but he has the patience of eons. He teaches his followers, too, to slowly wear down their opposition.
Like all the Elemental Rulers, Istishia has cults of mortal worshipers, but cares little for them.
Istishia is the enemy of Kossuth.
