Elder brains[/b] are believed to be the ultimate stage of the Illithid life cycle. Malevolent beings of godlike intellect, they exist partially in the Astral Plane (psionically hidden from the Githyanki) but mostly in the center of illithid cities.
Physically, they're enormous fused masses of neurons and ganglia collected from the brains of all the illithids who ever died in that community, like great glowing brains covered in tentacles. They squat in salty pools, tended to by slaves and feeding on those illithid tadpoles too weak to escape their tendrils. Illithids revere them, even worship them, wanting nothing so much as to become one with them when they die.
