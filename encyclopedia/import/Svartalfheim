Svartalfheim, a Realm in Nidavellir,&nbsp;is home to the svartalfar, also known as dock-alfar or dark elves. They are similar in appearance to the dark elves or drow of the Prime+Material and the Abyss, but neutral in alignment. Many are powerful runecasters, enchanters, and illusionists. They have a culture similar to that of the Norsemen, but more unpredictable, contrary and fey. 
Svartalfheim is also the home of the goddess Eilistraee.
