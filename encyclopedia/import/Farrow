Farrow is a shadow elf - that's a race of subterranean elves from Mystara, driven underground long ago by an honest-to-the-Immortals nuclear explosion they accidently set off. They're ruled by shamans who worship their "god" Rafiel.
Anyway, Farrow used to pose as a shaman, tattooing his face to imitate the birthmarks true shamans are born with. He belonged to a covert group called the Order of the Serpent, possibly associated with a darker god called Atzanteotl, bent on protecting their race by any means necessary. He got caught spying on a powerful wizard in the nation of Glantri, though, who banished him to Sigil. A funny kind of banishment, if you ask me, sending someone to the greatest collection of portals anywhere, but it can be hard to find a portal to one obscure Prime world, and Farrow still hasn't found one to his. Besides, he likes Sigil. The intrigues there are extremely tasty.
Anyway, he found the most possibilities for intrigue working for Shemeshka the Marauder, who uses him as a spy and mole. There's a lot more to the story than that, though you'll have to check out Uncaged: Faces of Sigil for the rest.
