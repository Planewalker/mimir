The brilliant mariliths, (MAR-rul-lith) masters of multitasking, are the foremost Tanar'ri strategists of the Blood War. They are creatures made for battle, not beauty, and have the long, sinuous bodies of giant serpents and the upper bodies of humanoid women with six arms that can easily wield six weapons at once. 
Many of them serve Graz'zt in "special" roles. They control Vudra, the 531st layer cataloged in the Abyss.
