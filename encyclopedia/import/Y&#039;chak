Y’chak (The Violet Flame) 
Y’chak is unique among the Elder+Evils in a terrible way—it is actively interested in the development of life or, to be more precise, in the development of the destruction of life. Its true form is said to be a brilliant pillar of violet flames that conceal an inner form so horrifying that to see it clearly is to invite utter destruction upon the body and soul.
