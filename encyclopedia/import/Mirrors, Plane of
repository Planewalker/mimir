The Plane of Mirrors is an alternate Transitive Plane introduced in the Manual of the Planes. It presents the concept that every mirror is a link to another realm, in this case, one consisting of mirrors in the multiverse. The plane is populated by the reflective humanoids, the Nerra; supposedly, it could be the refuge of the kamerel.
