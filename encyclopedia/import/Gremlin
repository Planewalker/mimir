Gremlins are tiny flying scavengers native to the Abyss, though many have escaped to other planes and interbred with goblinoids of various types. They are highly susceptible to mutation. Their skin ranges from brown to black to gray, frequently in a mottled blend. Their ears are large and pointed. In combat, they flee at any opportunity rather than fight face-to-face. 
Galltrits are a subspecies of gremlin, also native to the Abyss. Galltrits are nasty little stone-gray creatures who live in areas of dung, carrion, and offal. They average only six inches in height, a third the size of other gremlins. They are parasites who feed on the blood of their victims.
Fremlins, due to interbreeding, are not evil and can in fact be quite tolerable companions. They are not found on the Abyss.
Mites, due to interbreeding, are wingless and lawful. Snyads are true neutral relatives of mites, easily distinguishable by their full heads of hair. 
Jermlaines, though sometimes grouped with gremlins, are actually descendents of gnomes altered by the sorcery of an ancient empire. They may have some gremlin blood, as gremlins are capable of mating with just about anything of similar size. They worship the god Pyremius.
