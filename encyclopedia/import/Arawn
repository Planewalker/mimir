As Celtic Power of death and the underworld, Arawn rarely has reason to venture into the world of the living. In the eyes of his worshippers, his home is an island so far out at sea that no one, not even Manannan mac Lir, can find it while living, for only the dead can travel there. In fact, Arawn generally only sends an avatar to the world of the living after someone has been resurrected that Arawn would rather keep. Many other Celtic gods will endorse resurrections, but none can guarantee that Arawn will leave the matter at that. Arawn has absolute power over life and death among the Celts.
On resurrecting any individual, there is a chance that Arawn will intervene. He will either send his avatar to reclaim the body or he will attempt to bargain. He will offer some other similar character from the legions of the dead provided he can keep the original character. Refusal of his offer will be met with force.
He resides in his Realm, The Isles of the Cursed, in Niflheim, the Gray Waste's second Layer. Qaida is one of his proxies.
