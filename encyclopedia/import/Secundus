Secundi are the second-highest caste of modrons, immediately below Primus. A secundus appears as an incredibly thin, tall humanoid with a long, narrow face and deep-set eyes. 
There are only four secundi, and they serve as viceroys of the four quarters of Regulus. They dwell in towered cities at the center of their domains, and when Primus dies, one of the secundi replaces him.
