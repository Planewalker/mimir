This stoppered flask looks ordinary but radiates an aura of magic. If the stopper is removed, and the proper words spoken (Nemelle knows them), a stream of fresh or salt water pours out, as ordered. There are separate commands for the amount as well as the type of water. 

Stream pours out one gallon per round.


Fountain pours out a 5' long stream at 5 gallons per round.


Geyser pours out a 20' long stream at 30 gallons per round. The force of a geyser will kill small animals and insects. The command word must be given to stop it.

A decanter of endless water was responsible for the region of UnderSigil known as the Drowned Nations. It will relieve the thirst of Glyve, a face of living stone in the wall of the Weeping Stone Catacombs. It is also sufficient to free Ignus from his fiery prison.
