Winter's Hall is located on the Layer of Pandesmos in Pandemonium. This region is snowy and blizzard-ridden. Visibility, even when light can be had, is only a few feet. The snow never rests; the winds constantly whip it up so it coats tunnels and even creatures with a uniform layer of ice. Frost giants and winter wolves prowl the cold waste. These creatures serve a particularly cruel entity called many names but most often venerated as Loki. A hall can be found at the center of this Realm and it is here that Loki retreats when in trouble with his fellow Norse powers, and it is here where he works on his magery and plots far from the scheming eyes of the Aesir. 
The hall itself is a rough wooden building, long, high, and sooty from the smoky hearths. The traveler drawn by the light should be warned that within Pandemonium Loki's evil nature comes forth, unrestrained by the presence of the rest of his Pantheon. A large root of Yggdrasil reaches into Pandemonium here, forming the hall's central beam.
Winter's Hall is also the Realm of Auril.
