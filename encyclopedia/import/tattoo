A tattoo is a mark or design formed by the insertion of dyes under the skin or through intentional scarring - though other, less conventional, means also exist within the planes. Within The Cage the infamous tattoo artist Fell runs his Tattoo Parlour in Sigil's Market Ward. Fell is able to form tattoos from Dabus picture symbols above his head and is somehow then able to graft the pattern to a customers skin. It is rumoured that Fell also offers magical tattoos to his favoured customers, some of which can be peeled off and re-affixed through focus of will.
