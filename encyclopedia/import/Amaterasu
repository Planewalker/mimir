Amaterasu is a member of the [Japanese pantheon] and the goddess of the sun.  It is said she was born when [Izanagi] washed out his eye after returning from the Land of the Dead.  The Imperial Family on the [Material Plane] is descended from her (or so they claim).
Amaterasu's realm is [Radiant Light], in [Mercuria], on [Mount Celestia].
