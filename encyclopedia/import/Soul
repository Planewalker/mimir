Souls form in the Positive+Energy+Plane and incarnate in mortal bodies in the Prime+Material. From there, they travel through Astral+conduits to the Outer Planes associated with either the powers they worshipped in life or the planes that best match their Alignment. 
Sometimes pantheons have special rules for where souls go. The Faerunian pantheon sends souls to Kelemvor to be judged; the Chinese Pantheon sends souls to the Court+of+Judgement; the Indian Pantheon sends souls to Yama; the Norse Pantheon sends the souls that died in battle to Odin and souls that died in other ways to Hel. There are many other variations.
In the Outer Planes (and, for a few gods, other planes), souls become Petitioners. Petitioners may be transformed into Aasimon, minions+of+Set, Baatezu, Tanar'ri, slaadi (if infected by blue slaadi), or other planar beings, or they may ultimately, after many years of devote service, be permitted to merge with their Plane or god.
Some people believe in reincarnation, and reincarnation is a viable option. The Dustmen and Godsmen both believe that souls reincarnate in order to learn and attain an ultimate transcendence - for the Godsmen, this transcendence is divinity and whatever states may lie beyond that, while the Dustmen hope only for the oblivion of true death. Individual gods and pantheons, such as the Indian Pantheon, also reincarnate the souls of their worshippers.
