Subraces? In Planescape? 
I suppose Githyanki and Githzerai are subraces of the root gith forerunner species. There's more on Githzerai subraces in that species' entry like the gith pirates on the routes of spelljamming vessels.
There are, of course, many Baatezu subraces, and many Tanar'ri, Yugoloth, Eladrin, Modron, Guardinal, Archon, Slaad, and Genie subraces.
There are variant tieflings, like Fey'ri. 
Is that what you wanted to know?
