Zepar is a baatezu+noble in the service of Baalzebul; he leads 28 companies of cornugons.
Vicious and arrogant, he seldom engages in combat, but uses his magical powers and his servants to bully weaker creatures. When in a black mood, he wades into the hapless lemures and dishes out all the punishment he can deliver. He fights with a hand axe and a short sword.
Zepar appears as a slight, dark-complexioned man dressed in scarlet armor, with a grotesque clubfoot and a forked tail. He has small horns (concealed by his helm) and speaks in a grating, contemptuous voice. Beneath his armor is crimson skin, and a “normal” human foot that has retractile black catlike claws.
