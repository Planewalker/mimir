According to Japanese+mythology, Izanami created the land and all living things along with her husband, Izanagi. When Izanami died giving birth to the god of fire, Izanagi went to the Underworld to see her. For awhile the two fought, but they are now reconciled and live in Cherry Blossom, their realm in Abellio, on Arcadia.
Both Izanagi and Izanami share the rainbow as their holy symbol.
