Zzutam is an Ice paraelemental worshiped as a god by a tribe of frost giants in the Forgotten Realms novel Prince of Lies by James Lowder.



	"Zzutam is hardly worthy of that title, let alone the worship you give</p>
	him," Cyric said. "He's a frost elemental, not a true deity." Again,
	the blank looks from his audience made the Prince of Lies pause.
	"You're Zzutam's high priest, right, Thrym? Does he grant you any magic
	for your devotion?"
	&nbsp;
		"He makes snow," Thrym rumbled. "He send us chow."
		...For Thrym and his clan, Zzutam was the only power in the universe.
	He'd been the patron of their forefathers; he'd be the protector of
	their children - once the clan found a female who could tolerate any of
	them for more than a day.
