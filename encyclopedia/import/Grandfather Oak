Grandfather Oak is an enormous oak tree in Arvandor, the elven realm, with entire villages nestled in its branches. The ruler of the settlements is an ancient treant called Moss-Among-His-Roots, Wind-In-His-Leaves. This extremely elderly treant is near the limit of his kind's lifespan, though Grandfather Oak itself - which is not a treant - seems to be immortal.
Grandfather Oak was famed for its spider silk 30,000 years ago, before Lolth was banished, and there are still spider-haunted ruins within the labyrinthine branches, remnants left by the followers of the goddess then called Araushnee.
The goddess Sotillion visits Grandfather Oak from time to time, though she has her own Realm in Ysgard.
