Greeloxes are powerful, spiderlike creatures native to the Plane+of+Shadow. They have eight spiderlike limbs, two humanoid arms, and two front legs ending in scythelike blades. They are gray and brown, with dull red eyes and black claws and mandibles.
Greeloxes have a poisonous bite and can spin acidic webs. They can magically manipulate shadows, hide in shadows, and use shadows to magically transport themselves.
There are rumors of massive greelox cities on the Plane of Shadow, mazes of webs that take up acres of terrain. Greeloxes are born live and live about 50 years.
