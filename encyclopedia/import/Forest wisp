Native to the Hyper-reality of Beldaari, forest wisps are creatures that exist as pure energy or thought. They are similar to will o'wisps, but feed on happiness instead of panic, and thus encourage happiness in all they meet.
Beings of ordinary reality have difficulty tolerating the amount of happiness generated by hyper-real creatures like the forest wisps. The joy they cause is enough to destroy mere mortals.
