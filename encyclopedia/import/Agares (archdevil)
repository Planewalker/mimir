Agares is a baatezu+noble serving Levistus,
commanding 31 companies of Osyluth in the service of his frozen
master. 
This Agares appears as an old man, and has a brittle, quavering
voice. He often bears a hawk at his wrist. He has gray-scaled, clawed
reptilian feet, and a ruddy facial complexion that deepens to a scarlet
body skin hue (usually concealed by robes). Agares has a stumpy, gray
reptilian tail, and a humanoid body with curved, irregular-looking ribs
that make his ribcage look knotted and deformed. Tufts of gray beard
are matched by small, stubby gray horns. Agares has watery red eyes and
red hooked nails.
