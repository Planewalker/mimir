In the mountains of at least one Prime Material Plane world, never in the exact same place twice, the Moonarch of Sehanine appears as a sandstone arch some 200 feet in diameter. The material of the arch is pink-brown with hints of lavender during the day, but at night it has a cold blue glow.
Only elves can pass through the arch, and those that do find it's a portal to a Demiplane where avatars of the various gods of the Seldarine subject the elf to tests and trials adjudicating their virtue and capability. The demiplane is unnaturally vivid with riotous colors and plant growth. Days spent in the demiplane can be years to the Multiverse outside.
Those that return are forever changed by the experience, becoming secretive and dreaming actual dreams; many become priests of the powers who affected them the most, and some retreat to the edge of the world, or make pilgrimages to Arvandor to remain for the rest of their days.
