Hailing from Acheron, maugs[/b] are tireless soldiers in search of battle. They are used on battlefields across the planes as perfect mercenaries since they remain utterly loyal to their employer and fearless in battle. They serve any willing to meet their price. Maugs resemble stone golems in appearance but are an intelligent race and areÂ self-perpetuating.
