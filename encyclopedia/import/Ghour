Ghours are demons created by Baphomet. They're twenty feet tall monstrosities, vaguely resembling oversized ogres with hooves, horns, and bestial faces. They have stunning roars and can exhale a cloud of noxious gas. 
Baphomet sends ghours to cultists he is pleased with. Though they are native to the Abyss, ghours are not Tanar'ri.
