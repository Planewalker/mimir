Shothotugg (Eater of Worlds, The Great Whirlpool) 
Shothotugg is one of the few Elder+Evils to exist entirely within the realm of the Prime Material Plane. Shothotugg dwells in a distant corner of the Multiverse, physically far removed from the world itself. An undulant mass of seething fluid the size of a mountain, Shothotugg travels through the gulfs of space from world to world, poisoning and parasitizing any world on which it alights.
Kopru theologians call Shothotugg "the Great Whirlpool," considering it to be the embodiment of the element of water and the source of their supernatural powers, as well as one of the mothers of Demogorgon. They regularly sacrifice victims into deep undersea chasms in Shothotugg's honor.
