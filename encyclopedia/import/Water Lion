Water Lion's home across the planes is not known, but his avatars roam the Prime Material Plane without cease. Some say it is seeking a lost child or lost god who is his best friend - some say this is Stillsong. Though not part of his quest, he also hates sharks and will attack them on sight. 
Water Lion is a lesser god whose portfolio is unknown. His avatar appears as a huge sea lion whose body is made of salt water. He is playful and fascinated by song, but prone to bouts of black melancholy.
