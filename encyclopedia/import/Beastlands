The Beastlands are one of the Upper Planes, conceptually placed between Arborea and Elysium, pure Good with overtones of Chaos.
The Beastlands are also known as the Happy Hunting Grounds, the Animal's Rest, and the Wildlands, where the petitioners and denizens remain independent and self-sufficient, wandering alone or in groups through their own dreams and the great idealized dream of Nature itself. Visitors here take on animalistic attributes as their true hidden selves shine through the boundaries they ordinary put up. The plane is filled with animals of all kinds: ordinary animals, the spirits of animals, and the souls of humanoids who have become animals in the afterlife.
The Sign of One faction dominates parts of this plane, as its members journey here to contemplate their true selves, live among dreams, and admire the beauty of the Creation they helped make with the power of their imaginations.
Cloudlike, collective beings called Mortai drift overhead. In their misty forms can be distinguished faces and distant laughter. Flight spells are impossible on this plane.
The Beastlands are three layers, each representing a different intersection with the Sun and the Moon. 

Krigala is the daylit layer, closest to the other planes. Diurnal animals make their home here.
Brux is the twilight realm, a place of shadows where both Sun and Moon are visible.
Karasuthra is the night. Only the moon and stars are visible in the sky. Nocturnal creatures hunt in these realms.

Themes: Seek out goodness and knowledge in animals and nature. To thine own self be true.
