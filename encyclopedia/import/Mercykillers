Prior to the Faction War, the Mercykillers were one of the factions of Sigil and the planes. Also known as the Red Death, the Mercykillers were the last step of the juidical system in Sigil. The Harmonium made the arrests, the Guvners held the trials, and the Mercykillers carried out the sentence.
They kept up the Prison in The Lady's Ward of Sigil under the watch of Factol Alisohn Nilesia. In the planes, their outpost was in Acheron at Vorkehan.
Post-Faction War, the Mercykillers split back into their two original parts: The Sons of Mercy and the Sodkillers.
