Bune is a baatezu+noble in the service of Asmodeus, commanding 30 companies of cornugons. He is greedy and enjoys manipulating lesser beings of all sorts (including his warriors). His loyalty to Asmodeus is solid, but he is naturally “cheeky” to and defiant of all beings of whom he is scared. Asmodeus tolerates this because of all the dukes, Bune is the quickest and most careful in the execution of his orders. Bune is content with his position, sees Asmodeus as the most powerful of the Lords of the Nine and thus the safest lord, and will not betray him.
Bune generally resembles a cornugon in appearance, but his scaled body is green in hue (coppery on the belly and loins), and his talons are silvery in color. Bune’s head, however, is human — with dog-like furry ears and a great griffon-like beak. His voice is high-pitched and lilting, although he will screech if he becomes infuriated, and he is an excellent mimic of other beings.
