Djinn (Singular: djinni) are proud and sensuous genies of air. They look like tall, attractive men and women. Their skin ranges from sky-blue to dark tan. They dress in airy, shimmering silk garments designed to flatter their figures comfortably.
Djinn dwell on floating islands in the Elemental Plane of Air, where they make art out of all four elements. They're ruled by a great caliph in his Court of Ice and Steel. Though the djinn are good, they are mischievous and whimsical, and the punishment for a djinni who disobeys the Great Caliph is death.
On the Paraelemental+Plane+of+Smoke, the djinn are allied with the belkers against the efreet.
