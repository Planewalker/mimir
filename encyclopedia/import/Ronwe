A ronwe is a ghastly Baatezu that devours other creatures to transform them into her thralls.
This repellent thing reclines on a mattress of
conjoined twins. It cackles with mirth, its flab shaking with each
guttural chortle. A thin shift of excrement-stained silk cover sits
horrid form. Beneath, serpentine shapes writhe and twist, staining the
sheltering material with foulness. By far, the most horrific thing
about this abomination is its cavernous maw. A long green tongue licks
its calloused lips in expectation of its coming meal.
After they digest creatures whole, ronwe squeeze out hideous spawn from their birth sacs.
