Paraelementals are Elemental spirits native to the Paraelemental Planes.
Ice paraelementals (also called cold or frost paraelementals) are tall, humanoid creatures with bodies made of ice crystals covered in patches of frost. Piercing blue eyes peer out of their recessed sockets.
Magma paraelementals (also called heat paraelementals) are huge, stocky humanoids with amorphous masses of molten stone from the waist down. Their bodies are made of black rock; a reddish heat shines from within, particularly from their eyes and mouths.
Smoke paraelementals are dark clouds of stinking vapor, leaving behind soot in their wakes.
Ooze paraelementals (also called mud elementals) are liquid masses of dark, writhing tendrils of liquid earth and slime.
