Pseudonatural creatures are entities of the Far Realm, a space outside of space with alien geometries and creatures. Occasionally, one of these horrors are summoned to the known planes, where they attempt to take the shape of a native being. Even so, their forms are grotesque, with oozing pustles, eyes and tentacles scattered among its body in a haphazard fashion. Luckily, they don't stay here for long, as the confined physics of the known planes are inhospitable to them.
