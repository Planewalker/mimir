Ghostlights[/b] are clever and malicious entities closely related to the will-o'-wisp of the Prime Material Plane. Due to their planar nature, they have the power to dominate and hypnotize their victims, as well as drain their life energy. They look like balls of light. 
Ghostlights are thought to be native to the Lower Planes, but they can be found just about anywhere. In parts of the Outlands they're known as corpse-candles.
