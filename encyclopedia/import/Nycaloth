Nycaloths are the least of the greater yugoloths, lower in status than arcanaloths and ultroloths but higher than any of the other yugoloth castes. 
Nycaloths are green-skinned fiends with batlike wings and doglike faces. They have four deadly limbs. They are the spymasters of the Blood War, gathering information, spreading disinformation, and orchestrating the movements of lesser yugoloth agents.
Unlike most yugoloths, nycaloths can reproduce their own kind, but they find this distasteful and prefer not to. Instead, they recruit new members of their caste from promising marraenoloths. Nycaloths who show great intelligence and ability may be promoted to the Arcanaloth caste.
