Although it's believed they originated on the Prime Material Plane long ago, ethergaunts - or the khen-zai, as they call themselves - are now native to the Ethereal.
They are tall, spindly creatures, bipedal but not particularly humanoid, their heads emerging from their chests and covered with strange bisected masks. Beneath their masks are writhing cilliae - pure unadulterated madness. They have, however, no connection to the Far Realm. They are organized into at least three social castes, distinguishable by the color of their masks and carapaces.
Ethergaunts are atheists with nothing but disdain for gods and other outer planar entities. Their current project, frightingly possible given their technology, their sorcery, and their super-genius intellects, is to annihilate the races of the Material Plane they abandoned long ago, recolonizing the plane and terraforming it in their own image.
