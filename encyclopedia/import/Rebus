Rebus is the language of the Dabus, the servants of the Lady of Pain. Rebus, or more appropriately a rebus, is a series of pictures that appear in a 'balloon' that forms above a dabus's head when it desires to communicate with the folk of Sigil. The pictures, usually analogus to consanants that are planar common homophones,Â form a puzzle of sorts that must be pieced together to figure out what the dabus wishes to 'say.' For instance, the word cannot might be portrayed by the image of a tin can, a plus sign and the image of a rope tied in a knot.
