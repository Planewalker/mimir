Mythrien is one of several elven gods who have fallen since the Elder Days, when elven culture was more promi­nent in the world than it is now. In those days, mighty protective magic was wielded for the people's benefit. Although Corellon controls access to high magic itself, elven sages can attest that Mythrien assisted elven wizards in mastering the creation and weaving of mythals. He surrendered too much of his power in the process, however, and in an effort to boost his powers to their previous level he decided to create a mighty artifact at a hidden delve some­where on Faerun. Known as Mythrien's Ring, this relic proved his undoing, because at a critical point in the creation process, Malar appeared and attacked Mythrien's avatar. The magic went awry, the ring was lost, and Mythrien's lone avatar was imprisoned in the ground beneath the site of the battle. Since that time, Mythrien has freed himself but has chosen not to send avatars to the Prime Material Plane and has instead relied upon visions and manifestations to communi­cate his desires to his clerics. It goes without saying that he counts Malar as a blood enemy, but Mask and Talos are also included, since Mythrien believes that they assisted Malar in his attack. 
Mythrien never leaves Arvandor, preferring to stay in his palace, Mythralan. It levitates above the ground within a swirling mass of invisible (but tangible) mythal fields, and no other deity except Corellon or Sehanine know how to bypass these fields without his permis­sion. The morose Mythrien has lost the spark of gaiety that typifies the Seldarine, although there’s always hope that it will return.
