A phoenix is a creature of tremendous power and potent omen found on many of the Upper Planes. Many intelligent races look upon it as a Power or at least a Power's messenger or Proxy. Some believe they can control realms in the Outer Planes as gods can. A phoenix resembles an immense bird of prey whose wings are the color of fire. A phoenix can wreath its body in intense flames. Their reproduction is a result of self-immolation resulting in a new phoenix born from the ashes of the old.
Planetouched humanoids with the blood of phoenixes coursing through them are called phoeras.
