Ecstasy, the City of Plinths, is the Gate-town to Elysium. The landscape of and around Ecstasy is dotted with tall monoliths of stone and iron, which the local Petitioners use for meditation.
Ecstasy is open and sprawling, a collection of buildings and large manors built around a crossroads. The people of Ecstasy are mostly placid and in no hurry to get things done, peaceful like the plane they border. The locals define "evil" as anything that stunts personal growth, and nothing else is considered a crime. The Transcendent Order is popular here. The three high-ups of the Burg are mysterious bashers with flamboyant names: the Sun Master, the Dark Hunter, and the Philosopher+King.
In the center of the Burg is a tower of ivory known as the Bone Plinth. On top of the Bone Plinth is a pool of quicksilver, the portal to Elysium.
