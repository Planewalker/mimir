Also called the black death, Hive plague thrives in the filth, dirt, and pestilence of the Hive Ward. Cranium Rats are thought to be prime carriers for the disease, though they have no immunity.
Symptoms include blackened, painful nodes on the neck and limbs of the victim. These nodes fill with a black oozelike substance that devours the victim's blood, literally sucking the blood from the victim's body as they grow. 
A Berk named Ridnir Tetch, head of the Weary Spirit Infirmatory in the Hive, deliberately injects captured cranium rats with the plague in his mad attempts to find a non-magical cure.
