Panicky, harmless-looking beetles native to the Ethereal Plane, ether scarabs are fed upon by a variety of ethereal predators, so they have evolved the ability to flee across planar boundaries. An ether scarab has six tentaclelike legs and a hard, amethyst-veined chitinous shell marked by swirling, colorful patterns. It tears through planar boundaries with its two pairs of mandibles. Attacks from their mandibles are particularly dangerous to living creatures.
An ethereal scarab that dies on a plane that neighbors the Ethereal explodes, creating a planar rip.
