Trocopotacas are big, white crocodilian creatures that prefer the damp.
They live in the catacombs under Sigil's street, fighting the
vargouilles and Collectors foolish enough to venture into their lairs.
They are a legend among the mothers of the Hive, used to frighten
children and criminals alike into sumbission. They exist. They're nasty.</p>
