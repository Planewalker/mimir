Also known as Leonis for its discoverer, the Demiplane of Invention is a pocket reality in the Ethereal Plane shaped like a four-sided pyramid four miles on a side, although those who travel to an edge loop back to the opposite edge, creating an illusion of infinity.
The demiplane's landscape is almost entire made up of twisted metal and broken cogs (some suggest that it is the junkyard of Mechanus). Periodically, more broken machinery pours in from the demiplane's peak. 
The laws of reality in the demiplane are such that magic and technology operates by the Law of Similarity, so that things must physically resemble their intended function if they are to work. In addition, the demiplane encourages randomness and unpredictability, giving elaborate and contrived inventions a better chance of working and enhancing wild magic.
The Demiplane of Invention is principally inhabited by tinker gnomes and the mad wizard Leonis.
