Nyarlahotep, the Crawling Chaos, is a lesser god. He appears as a tall dark man but is believed by some students of the occult to have various guises, including a red bat-like form with three evil eyes. His appearance in the world is said to foretell the return of the Old Ones from their imprisonment.  
He dwells mostly on the Astral Plane.
