A tiefling is a being with a touch (less than half of their bloodline) of fiendish heritage. Rarely do they know where their heritage came from. They may derive this heritage from Tanar'ri, baatazu, or Yugoloth lines. Some tieflings' heritages are so mixed that they are any combination of fiendish blood.
It is said that no two tieflings are the same, either physically or as to the "special" traits they may exhibit. These traits may include enhanced infra/nightvision, enhanced resistance to various natural and magical effects (such as electricity, fire, cold, poison, etc.), spell-like abilities (such as charming others, turning invisible, summoning insects, etc.) that could be used a limited number of times over a specific amount of time and physiological aberations (such as scaly skin than gave some protection versus attack, other than five digits on their hands and feet, goat or horse legs, etc.) amongst countless others.
A being with half or more than half fiendish blood is a half-fiend. Cambions and alufiends are examples of half-fiends.
