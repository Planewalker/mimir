For the Egyptian goddess, see Nut.
Dana Knutson was the original conceptual artist behind Planescape, sketching the various faction symbols, the look of Sigil and its people, and the Lady of Pain. He painted the covers of the Planescape Campaign Setting box, Planes of Chaos, In the Cage: A Guide to Sigil, Vortex of Madness, and the paintings on several of the Planescape poster maps (though not the maps themselves, which were by Rob Lazaretti), among other pieces. He published a limited edition Planescape Sketchbook, which was sold only at GenCon. The illustration of Sigil in the Planar Handbook was also his.
