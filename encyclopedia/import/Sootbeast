A sootbeast is a 10 feet long creature with shaggy black hair thick with soot, its grimy toothless mouth belching smoke.
Despite its somewhat frightening appearance, the beast is mostly harmless and entirely blind. It’s strictly a filter feeder – it strains miniscule floating creatures by drifting slowly through the Paraelemental+Plane+of+Smoke.
