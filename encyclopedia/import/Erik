Erik (air-ick), a Cerilien Power of the woodlands, is true neutral. His most commonly encountered title is the Old Father of the Forests. His symbol is the oak tree. Erik is the guardian of the wilderness, the protector of the forests, and the patron of Cerilia's animals. Rangers, druids, hunters, and the Rjurik people favor Erik. He is allied with his wife Avani and Ruornil against his enemies, Belinik and the gods of the humanoids. Erik accepts worshipers of any non-evil alignment. Most of his priesthood follow druidic traditions, but clerics are not unknown. 
Erik's realm in the Outlands, Nature's Rest, is almost an exact copy of Cerilia, except it is Cerilia as it would have been without any intelligent beings living on it. Food is easy to come by and the worshipers of Erik lucky enough to make it here travel the lands marveling at its natural wonders.
Erik shares his realm with Geshtai.
