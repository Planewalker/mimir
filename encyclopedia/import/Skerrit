Skerrit is the Power of centaurs. He is also revered by more neutrally aligned sylvan elves. He works with other sylvan deities to protect pristine sylvan woodlands, along with the centaurs and fey folk. He is a kindly and merciful god, but he is also a fine hunter and protector, skilled and strong. His Realm, Skerrit's Glade, is found in Krigala in the Beastlands near Ehlonna's Grove of the Unicorns.
