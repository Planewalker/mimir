Angur-boda is a fearsome giantess-witch who dwells in Jarnvid, a forest within Jotunheim. There, she and her fellow witches plot the ruin of the Aesir and await the day of Ragnarok. Though her natural form is that of a hideous giantess, she can appear as a stunningly beautiful woman. In the latter form, she often walks among both gods and men.
Angur-boda is the mother of the monsters Fenris Wolf, Hel, and Jormungandr by Loki, and of Gerda by a frost giant.
