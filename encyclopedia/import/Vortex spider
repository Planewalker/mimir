Vortex spiders are relatives of the Phase spider who dwell in the Demiplane+of+Time. They look like their cousins, but have a blue-gray chitinous hide with several patches of dull waxy color and texture. Their color can change to blend in with their webs, which are completely invisible in the mist-smoke of the Demiplane of Time. Their webs are, in fact, made of pure temporal energy, spun from the mist-smoke that permeates the whole plane. They spin webs up to 50 feet in diameter, hiding in one corner of it, using their chameleonlike ability to match their coloration to their environment.
