Oberon is the king of the Seelie+Court, Titania's consort. Some call him the King of Shadows, others call him the Lord of Beasts. He and Titania often quarrel, causing storms, fogs, floods, crop failings, pestilence, unseasonable weather, and so on until they make up. When Oberon and Titania are in harmony, blue skies and perfect weather prevail. 
Oberon spends much time away from his queen, being happier hunting the woodlands with his knights; he particularly enjoys stag-hunting. 
He appears as a wingless male faerie of unusual size.
