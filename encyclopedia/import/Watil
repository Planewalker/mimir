Watil, sister of Kiltzi, is the Guardian of Plants in the pantheon of Maztica. She is portrayed as a voluptuous human female, though she can also take the form of any plant she desires. She dresses in green, and though she is young and attractive her hair is white.
Watil is worshipped under numerous aspects - the goddess of mayz, the goddess of flowers, the goddess of mushrooms, the goddess of seaweed, the goddess of cactuses, the goddess of fruit, and the goddess of cocoa. All are, in truth, Watil. Often she is viewed as a pawn of Azul, god of rain, for she is always at his mercy.
The Guardian of Plants dwells in the fourth Layer of Elysium, Thalasia, on an island called Xilen, the Heaven of Milk Trees. The souls of those who have died in infancy dwell in Xilen, which is filled with lush plant life of all kinds, including trees whose fruits produce mother's milk.
