Cania, the Eighth Hell, is the eighth Layer of Baator. It is dominated by intense, freezing cold, and is extremely hostile toward those who are unwelcome on the layer, which includes nearly every being that enters. It is the home of the Gelugon baatezu.
Cania is ruled over by Mephistopheles. The seat of his power is the citadel Mephistar, which sits atop the glacier Nargus. The Lord of the Eighth can control the movement of Nargus.
Many things lie hidden under the ice of Cania: vast lost cities, frozen armies of creatures. The primary portal to access Nessus is through a gaping hole guarded by 9,999 gelugons. At the bottom of the dizzyingly deep pit is an icy body of water and 1,001 fathoms deem in that is a silvery portal to Malsheem.
