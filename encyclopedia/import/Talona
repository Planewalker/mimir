Talona of the Faerunian pantheon is often depicted as a withered old crone with a scarred, tattooed face - basically identical to the Finnish goddess Kiputytt√∂, whom Talona killed and supplanted. She has the personality of a petulant, greedy child trapped in the body of a once-beautiful woman now scarred by horrific disease and ravaged by age. She is the goddess of poison and disease. She also absorbed Sss'thasine'ss, god of venomous creatures.
Talona dwells in Carceri in the Layer of Cathrys, in the Palace of Poison Tears. The hot and humid fen there is infested with parasites and infectious agents. The pyramid-shaped palace squatting in the mud echoes her triangular symbol. 
Talona is a servant of Talos.
