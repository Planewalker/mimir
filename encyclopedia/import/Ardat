Ardat, known as the Unavowed, is the shrill and emotional Demon Queen of Harpies, briefly allied with Baphomet in a brutal strike against the gnoll spire-city of Hykanask on Vorganund, which is catalogued as the 52nd Layer of the+Abyss. Baphomet betrayed her, adding her to his growing list of enemies.
Ardat's area of influence also includes secret or failing marriages. She rules a cabal of half-fiend harpies called the Soul Sirens, but does not control a layer of her own.
