Ahto is a Finnish god of seas and water; his worshipers call him the King of the Seas. His Realm in the Elemental Plane of Water is called Curling Wave - his symbol, a rippling wave of water, appears throughout it.
He is served by reef giants and his two chief proxies, the human bard Alanoin and the Water Dwarf. Some say the Water Dwarf was once king of a dwarven nation, but was drowned in a Vortex to the Elemental Plane of Water when his people mined too deeply into the earth. Ahto restored him to life, transforming his physical form into pure water. In essence, he is a water elemental with the spirit of a dwarf trapped inside.
