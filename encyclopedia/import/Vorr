In Carceri, the Abyss, the Outlands, and Pandemonium prowl packs of vorrs[/b], hyenalike creatures with intelligent faces, long ratlike tails, and the ability to transform into beings of living shadow. They are native to Pandemonium, but exist as scavengers and predators on a variety of planes.
Vorr packs are led by female shamans, larger and older than the males. They likely get their spells from Yeenoghu.
