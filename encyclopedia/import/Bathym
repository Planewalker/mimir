Bathym is a baatezu+noble in the service of Belial and Fierana, and leads 30 companies of hamatulas. He is sometimes called “The Black Duke,” after his custom of wearing jet black armor (with full helm) and a black cloak. 
Bathym has black-hued eyes, black hooves, and black nails. His skin, horns and tail are a dead, fishbelly-white color. Bathym’s forked tail is short and curled like a pig’s; he is most sensitive about it and keeps it concealed. When angry, Bathym hisses like a snake when he speaks.
