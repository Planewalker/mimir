Nin-Hursag was the wife of Enki. She is a lesser power of earth, gravity, and magnetism. She dwells in Elysium with Enlil and Ki.
Nin-Hursag's mourning has caused her realm, the Great Mountain of the East, to grow unstable and begin to crumble. 
The goddess's sacred animal is the mole. Her sacred color is that of dust. Her holy day is the spring equinox, and she asks that weapons be sacrificed in her name. She is an ally of the goddess Nesirie of Cerilia.
