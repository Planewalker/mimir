Iggwilv [/b]is a powerful wizard from Oerth, infamous for her studies of Abyssal beings. Her summoning and affair with the demon lord Graz'zt resulted in Iuz, a Cambion who became a demi-god. She is also known from her Demonomicon, one the best resources on demons.
Residing in a tower alongside the Styx in the Waste's layer of Niflheim, Iggwilv is served by a quartet of arcanaloth apprentices: Sembra, Sovashi, Ridder, and Landerbold.
