Phantasia, lesser goddess of ideas, inventions, and imaginations, is the eldest child of Hypnatia. She is chaotic good. She is depicted as a slender, short-haired woman clothed in a simple shift, with half-elven features and a manic, feral grin. Sometimes her inspirations are too much for a dreamer, and she is little more welcome than a Night Hag or her brother Phobetor.
She dwells in the Region of Dreams.
