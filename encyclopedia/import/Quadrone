Quadrones are a caste of modrons resembling cubes with a mixture of organic and clockwork parts. They are capable of performing four tasks at once, and most of them have four arms. Some have a pair of wings substituting for their second pair of arms.
Quadrones are field officers within the modron armies. They accept orders from Pentadrones and give orders to tridrones.
Rogue Modrons always take a form similar to that of winged quadrones.
