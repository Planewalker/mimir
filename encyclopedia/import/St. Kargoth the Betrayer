Kargoth was a great paladin until he unleashed the demonic terror Arendagrost on the Prime Material Plane in a mad bargain for personal power. The grateful demon prince Demogorgon transformed Kargoth into the first and most powerful Death Knight.
When the forces of good, led by Benedor, rallied and drove away the horror,
Kargoth exulted in his newly won power and performed many deeds of great malevolence and harm to the forces of good. Finally the scale of his atrocities grew to a point where he ascended to the status of a saint, a negative counterpart to heroic saints like St.+Bane. Kargothâ€™s powers are many and terrible. He currently serves Demogorgon on his Abyssal layer.
