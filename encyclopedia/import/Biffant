Biffant is a noble+baatezu, the provost of Dispater. He runs the affairs of Dispater's tower, where he is usually found, accompanied by two Erinyes and six spinagons and carrying an iron rod as a weapon and symbol of his office.
He appears as a portly, blood-red humanoid Baatezu, wingless but with a small, tufted tail and two inward-pointing, hook-curved horns that sprout from his head above either temple. His eyes are deep blue-green, and he is always smiling.
