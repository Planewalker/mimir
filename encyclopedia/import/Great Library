The Great Library in Sigil is a tower, unaffiliated with any Faction or guild, in The Lady's Ward. It is run and maintained by the Dabus.
It consists of endless tiers of books connected by a spiral staircase. Secrets and lore from across the Multiverse are preserved here. The cost of research is one gold piece per day.
