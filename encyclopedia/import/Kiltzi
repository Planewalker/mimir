Kiltzi is the Giver of Health, Growth, Nourishment, and Love is the pantheon of Maztica. She is also goddess of flower buds, pregnant women, babies, rainbows, and the moon. She is invoked at weddings, during pregnancies, after childbirth, and of course while in the process of making babies, drunken orgies being the most auspicious time for that.
She is portrayed as a healthy, vibrant woman, usually very pregnant, clad only in her long hair. Her eyes are like dark, beautiful pools of water.
It should be no surprise that Kiltzi dwells in Arborea, in a realm she calls Teotecan in the first Layer of that plane, which is called either Olympus or Arborea but should not be confused with the realms of the elven or Greek pantheons, which exist on the same layer. Teotecan is a valley on a fertile plain; Kiltzi gets along well with the other gods of the plane, causing no friction with them.
She is very similar to the goddess Xochiquetzal.
