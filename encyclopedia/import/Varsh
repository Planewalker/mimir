The varsh [/b]are Githyanki in charge of raising and training the young. This is almost always done outside of the Astral Plane because time does not pass in the Astral, and thus it's impossible to grow up there without powerful aging magic or the auras of certain dead gods of time. This task is something of a sacrifice, since the varsh age along with their charges.
