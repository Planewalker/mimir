The Lady's Ward (never just "Lady's Ward," because this is the Lady of Pain we're talking about) is Sigil's wealthiest district, the home of the obscenely rich and powerful. These so-called Golden+Lords are movers and shakers across the multiverse, able to buy and sell entire worlds and species. 
The Lady's Ward is also Sigil's center of law and order, home of the City Barracks, City Courts, and City Prison. In a way, it's the antithesis of the impoverished, lawless Hive Ward. 
It's a place of broad, clean, well-patrolled streets, mansions, palaces, monuments, and cathedrals. The architecture of The Lady's ward is grand and splendid enough to give the great capitals of the planes (like Yetsirah and Malsheem) a run for their money.
