The Iron Crucible is an inner planar Vortex resembling a fountain of molten metal; it goes in both directions between the Sevenfold Mazework and the City of Brass. It is commonly used by Dao and efreet who wish to trade with one another, though recently the Yikaria have begun demanding exorbiant tariffs.
