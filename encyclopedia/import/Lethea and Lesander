Lethea and Lesander were powerful leaders in the Free League, a Faction without leaders, before the Faction War. They are twins, wemics from the world of Rublia. They were captured as cubs by a Sigilian biologist, Gorad Drummerhaven, but escaped to make their own way in the harsh streets of the Cage. 
They were mazed along with their friend Bria Tomay before the Faction War began.
