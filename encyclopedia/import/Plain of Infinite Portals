The Plain of Infinite Portals, sometimes sardonically called the Palace of 1001 Closets and incorrectly called Pazunia, is the first and primary Layer of the Abyss, touching the Astral Plane and containing portals to Pandemonium, Carceri, the Outlands, and most of the other Abyssal layers.
The Plain of Infinite Portals is a barren, infinite wasteland
peppered with mountains and black, gaping pits. Each of these pits
leads to a "deeper" layer of the Abyss. Iron fortresses guard the portals and war against one another, the princelings who rule these fortresses hoping to gain enough power and prestige to turn their domains into true Abyssal layers.
The fortress-town of Ferrug guards lakes of molten iron. Broken Reach is the gate-town leading to the Outlands. Other settlements include Mithrengo, Styros, Raazorforge, the Doomguard-influenced town of Gallowsgate, the tower of the succubus Chiryn, and the endlessly warred-over Fortress of the Fallen Stair.
