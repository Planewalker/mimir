Neabaz serves Baalzebul as herald, and as such is rarely idle. As herald, he is is the only devil allowed by Baalzebul to move freely about Baator. He respects his master and likes his work, for he is placed in the Nine Hells well above any station he could achieve by his own means.
Neabaz appears as a smoothly polite, cold-blooded, and very handsome man â€” save for his tiny pointed horns and transparent, housefly-like wings. He is customarily garbed in black tunic (open at the shoulders to accommodate his wings) and breeches, with a hat and cape of rich, blood-red silk. The cape is magical, having the ability to give forth an aura of flames. When his human-like mouth is open, he can extrude a foot-long proboscis
from within and suck blood. Neabaz is careful and polite at all times,
fearing to offend an arch-devil (and any creature may be a polymorphed
arch-devil, to his slightly paranoid mind).
