Ulutiu is a demigod of glaciers, polar environments, and arctic dwellers. After his affair with Othea, the wife of the giant god Annam, was discovered, he voluntarily sunk into the Cold Ocean, creating the Great Glacier.
His descendants include several giant races, including fomorians, voadkyn, firbolgs, and verbeegs.
With almost no worship, he now sleeps in the Astral Plane, almost dead.
