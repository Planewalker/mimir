Malebranches are huge, hulking devils with wickedly curving horns. They serve other, more intelligent members of the Baatezu hierarchy as warriors, enforcers, punishers, and occasionally mounts. Their form is something of a punishment for baatezu who are too smart for their own good, used to keep them from being a threat to their superiors.
In 1st edition, "malebranche" was another name for the horned devil, or Cornugon.
