Terlens are winged, sharklike amphibians found in Carceri. They came originally from the Prime Material Plane (in a world called Gamma Terra, where they are known as tree fish or terleens), but have adapted well to the Red Prison. Originally they were mutant barracudas with feathers and psionic powers; the Carcerian version is slightly smaller (about 7 feet long, instead of 9 feet), their psionic powers lost with their feathers, their fins extending to membranous wings. Perhaps some Arcanaloth or Shator decided to shape them to their liking.
Terlens travel in groups called schools or flights (depending on whom you ask). They are constantly on the move; they have no lairs. They normally feed on fish, birds, small reptiles, or mammals, though they are bold enough to attack Larvae, Petitioners, or small fiends under the right circumstances. They mate once per year, laying clutches of 50 to 100 eggs in sandy or muddy pits.
