The Mortuary is the ancient headquarters of the Dustmen faction, located in Sigil's Hive Ward. Before the Faction War, it was known for its vast number of portals to graveyards and places like the Elemental+Plane of Fire where corpses could easily be disposed. After the Tempest of Doors, these portals changed, but the Dustmen still dwell within these ancient walls, with their zombie servants and enigmatic monuments of Cyclopean stature.
