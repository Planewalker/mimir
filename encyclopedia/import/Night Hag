Night hags, or the gray sisters as they've been named, are a race of fiends native to the Gray Waste. Though related in some way to the hags of the Prime Material Plane (and sharing the same patron goddess, Cegilune), they are a breed apart, beings of pure evil whose reproductive cycle is connected with the writhing, piteous Larvae their plane makes of evil souls.
Night hags are the primary traders of larvae on the Lower Planes, selling their wares to Tanar'ri, Baatezu, Yugoloths, liches, and pretty much anyone else who wants them. They wander the Waste, herding larvae into their corrals, and they visit souls on the Material Plane in dreams, transforming them into larvae against their will from within their nightmares. In this way they gain larvae from choicer and more powerful souls than are common.
Night hags resemble hideous human women with skin the color of a bruise, long noses and sometimes horns. Often they ride Nightmare steeds.
