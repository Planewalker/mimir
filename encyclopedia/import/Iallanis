Iallanis is the goddess of love, forgiveness, mercy, and beauty in the Giant Pantheon, younger than her sister Hiatea. She hopes to unite all giantkind, and she is allied with the swanmay goddess Fionnghuala.
Her Realm in Arborea is called </font>Florallium, a place of quiet gardens and crystal springs. It is a neutral place where terms of peace can be arranged. It is said that when the Seldarine drove the other giant gods out of the plane they allowed Iallanis to remain, as she stayed by the hearth instead of fighting. They don't respect her, though, as they do her warlike brothers and sisters.</p>
