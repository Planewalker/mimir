The City Courts are where all Sigilian legal matters, whether civil or criminal, are resolved. They are located in the Triad District of The Lady's Ward. The Courts sit in the center of the ward, downward from the Singing Fountain and the Palace of the Jester. 
Prior to the Faction War, the Fraternity of Order ran the courts and used the structure as the Faction's headquarters. After the conflict, the majority of the Guvners left the city for Mechanus and the legal system was left to be restructured. The Dabus have taken upon themselves the duties of magistrates within the City Courts in order to restore unbiased justice to Sigil, untainted by the suspect work of Haskar's magistrates. The courts also oversee voting in the Sigil Advisory Council.
