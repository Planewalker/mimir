The Infinite Staircase is a gravity-defying structure of limitless expanse originating in the Gates of the Moon in Ysgard and extending to every significant source of creativity in the Multiverse and beyond. Thousands of different kinds and styles of landings make up the Stair, which is protected by Lillends and Shards.
Chant says that those who walk the Infinite Staircase have a chance to find the city of their heart's desire, but only one. If they find the city and leave, they will never find it again - at least, not using the Infinite Staircase.
