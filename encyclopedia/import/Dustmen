The Dustmen - also called Dusties, or the Dead - are the caretakers of Sigil's Mortuary, a huge morgue in the Lower Ward filled with bodies. The Faction seems to be a pretty somber bunch, rarely showing expression or interest in anything. They seem intent only upon taking care of all the dead bodies that come into the Mortuary, cataloguing them, preparing them, then burying them... somewhere.
They believe that the universe is merely a shadow of a happier existence, one from which we've passed on, and that we cling to a false life and emotions out of a habit, a bad habit. It is the goal of the Dustmen to break that habit, to achieve True Death. They attempt to become completely tranquil, making themselves bereft of emotion and uncaring about existence.
Prior to the Faction War, the Dead had but one Factol, Skall, the faction's founder. The faction is now led by Oridi Malefin, a cleric of death.
Since the Faction War, they've ceased to be a part of Sigil's government, but they continue their duties as always.
