The argenach[/b] RilmaniÂ [/b]are advisers and agitators who work to ensure that no one gains the upper hand for long in any part of the Multiverse. They are especially interested in the affairs of countless worlds of the Prime Material Plane; they believe that the war of good, evil, law, and chaos will be fought and won in the mortal realms.
They resemble tall humanoids with skin like silver.
