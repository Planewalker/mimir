Azer are honorable creatures who mine rocks of basalt that survive in pockets of elemental earth on the Elemental+Plane+of+Fire. Azer are the greatest smiths of the fiery races, and they are rumored to be the ones who laid the foundation of the City of Brass. They have no fear of ice or water, either.
Azer live in an extremely regimented society where every individual has his or her place. They construct their outposts and cities as complexes of towers built from basalt, granite, or metal. There they dwell in small family groups, using their plentiful flames to shape the stone. They grow strange trees with metallic outer skins or barks, and the leaves of these trees are actually made of metal - in some cases, precious metals. 
Azer are unfriendly and taciturn, and they lack compassion. They are greedy, particularly for gems that are a clear purple or red. Once given, the word of an azer is a solid bond. The descendents of azer and shield dwarves are Azerblood.
All azer swear fealty to Amaimon, the legendary king of their race. Some evil or vengeful azer worship the goddess Kaelthiere.
