To a wizard, the planes represent knowledge and power, and the wizard who can learn the secrets of the planes without regard to those planes' alignments or other traits is a true master of magic.
Wizards and sorcerers are not viewed with the same degree of respect accorded in most other settings. The planes are highly magical themselves, and wizards are just another part of it all.
