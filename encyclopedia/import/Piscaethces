Piscaethces (The Blood Queen)  
Piscaethces, the source of the Aboleth race, is depicted as a vast aboleth with no tentacles and with mucus the color of blood. The aboleths believe that the Blood Queen travels the currents of probability between infinite realities, spreading her seed almost as an afterthought as she moves from one world to another.
