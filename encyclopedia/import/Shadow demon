Shadow fiends, or shadow demons, are gaunt, angular, winged human-shaped forms made of evil and darkness. They live in small villages in eerie hollows throughout the Lower Planes. They're a race of artists, creating elaborate sculptures of shadow supported in the middle of the air by their powerful wills. 
These fiends are traders of souls. They imprison minds in gems, trading captured intellects for evil magic, which they shape into new shadow fiends. On the Prime Material Plane they sometimes work as advisors or assistants to evil creatures of great power, particularly dragons, eagerly snatching their souls as well upon their deaths.
Many of them serve Rhyxali as spies, though some serve Erebus on the Plane+of+Shadow. Some elite shadow demons are in the service of Socothbenoth.
The king of the wererats of Sigil is a shadow demon called Tattershade. One of the secret masters of Bedlam is a shadow demon called Hrava. Another prominent shadow fiend is Ly'kritch, an ally of Qaida's in the City of Doors.
