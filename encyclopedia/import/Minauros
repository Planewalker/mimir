Minauros is the third Hell of Baator. It is a place of acid rain and flesh-slicing hail. The huge stone city of Minauros the Sinking can be found forever sinking into the foul bog that fills the Layer. Mammon the Viscount is the ruler of Minauros. Below the city are said to be the ruins of a Burg that once resided in the Outlands, a burg filled with riches beyond dreaming. Hanging in the sky over the stink of Minauros can be found the Anthill of Jangling Hiter, suspended by chains suspended from who knows what. 
The realm of Hecate, Aeaea, is also located here.
