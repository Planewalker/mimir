These evil death-dealers exist on the layers of the+Abyss, and can only enter the Material+Plane through reflective surfaces, such as mirrors or ponds.
Fetch look like haggard, pale imitations of any medium-size humanoid gazing into a reflective surface; if more than one possible victim, the fetch assumes the appearance of the nearest opponent or chooses randomly. Its eyes are dull and lifeless, and its skin is icy to the touch. A fetch reflexively breaks into a cruel grin when its eyes first meet those of its intended victim.
Fetch do not speak, although they will engage in limited telepathic communication with other evil outsiders or evil clerics.
