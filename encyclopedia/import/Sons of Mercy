The Sons of Mercy[/b] are a revival of an ancient Faction, reborn from the ashes of the Faction War. Reestablished by their current leader, Arwyl+Swan’s+Son, they have focused on upholding justice and good across the planes. Though they’re a bit disorganized, their hearts are pure – for better or for worse. They are intent on bringing their brand of justice to the planes whether the planes want it or not. But rather than force others into the fold as their predecessors did, most are content in the belief that their righteous deeds will set an example for the planes as a whole.
Philosophy[/b]: Justice exists to uphold the greater good.
Headquarters[/b]: Bytopia. 
Nickname[/b]: Martyrs.
Alignment[/b]: Any good.
Symbol[/b]: A hand reaching up to grasp a sword by the blade; indigo blood runs down over a purple backdrop. Black edges curl around and infringe in a jagged fashion, symbolizing the ever-present threat of evil.
In Sigil the faction has taken on one of the tasks of the Mercykillers, that as wardens of the City Prison. There they act as an adjunct to the City Watch.
