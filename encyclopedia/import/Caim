Caim is an outcast noble+baatezu bound to Avernus. He is a gossip and a sneak, particularly disliked by the rulers of Baator. He is a skillful and charismatic speaker, and he loves to taste the flesh of elves and men.
Caim's form is that of a large, upright, darkly handsome bird - a thrush - with a long, sharp beak and a belt about his hips.
