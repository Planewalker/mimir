Ki, the Sumerian goddess of nature and animals, appears as an elfin woman of great beauty. Like most of the divinities of her pantheon, she is a shape-changer. Her priests and priestesses are druids who dress in kilts and conical hats. 
Her sacred animal is the tiger. Her color is forest green. Her holy days are the autumnal and vernal equinoxes, when rams are burnt in her honor.
Ki is the least civilized of the Sumerian deities. Since the death of Enki, she has begun expanding her portfolio to include rivers and seas. She dwells in the Great Mountain of the East in Eronia, with Enlil and Nin-Hursag.
