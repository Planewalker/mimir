Yeah, I've heard the rumors. That there were other rulers of Baator before the current Dark+Lord. Some say the plane used to be ruled by these "ancient+Baatorians" or even by yugoloths who had been tainted by Law back before there were any other kinds of fiends. Others rattle their bone-boxes about Barmy nonsense involving fallen celestials. I don't buy it, myself. Not for a Sigilian minute. 
Of course, in an infinite Multiverse, anything's possible...
Unless you mean Beherit. I believe in him.
