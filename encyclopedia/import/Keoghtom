Keoghtom is the Hero-power of Secret Pursuits, Natural Alchemy, and Extraplanar Exploration who originated on the Prime world of Oerth. A jack of all trades, Keoghtom has mastered hunting, alchemy, and the Old Lore of the bards. He has traveled throughout the Flanaess ('eastern' Oerth), but he has since left that world and now walks the boundaries and trails of the Outer Planes. 
Keoghtom most often appears as a young human male of slight build, wearing elven leathers or fine clothes of silk. Keoghtom is best known for his eponymous Ointment. It is a magic item, a small jar of magical unguent. When rubbed on an affected area, this ointment cures poison, diseases, and wounds.
