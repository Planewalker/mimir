Shad are natives of the Elemental Plane of Earth, spawned from the magic of druids who attempted to transform the plane into an elemental plane of plants (and failed). It's believed the shad were once insects crawling on leaves and stems, but you wouldn't know it from the way they look today: Shad are lean, gray-skinned humanoids, able to contort their bodies to extreme degrees. Their hair is nearly always short and dark. Oversized eyes dominate much of their faces, and are most often colored various earth tones, from golden yellow to ruddy brown to drab green. Clothing varies greatly from clan to clan, but is most commonly simple clothing or armor with precious stones sewn in. 
Short-lived but extremely fertile, shad wander their plane, using their magic to create the trees and plants they need to survive.
