Although more closely related to the giants than either the Aesir or the Vanir, Aegir is the Norse Power of the ocean and personification of its strength for good or ill. He lives in a great castle on the bottom of the ocean with his wife, Ran, and their nine daughters the Tempests. Aegir is sometimes called “Alebrewer” because he often throws feasts for his friends, the Aesir. Aegir has the power to create or quell storms at sea. In his true form, he is a giant standing sixty feet tall. He has a long gray beard, and carries a tree-sized club carved in the shape of a maiden which can deliver great damage to structures or beings.
The only predictable thing about Aegir is that if ship captains don’t offer a valuable sacrifice to him when beginning a voyage, they are certain to feel his wrath. When he decides to sink a ship, he often sends his avatar to smash it to bits with his club. Other times, he simply destroys it with a terrible storm. He looks with favor upon raiders and pirates. If such men make the proper sacrifices to him, Aegir is likely to aid them with favorable winds, or to conceal their approach with a storm or fog. 
Deep Sashelas considers Aegir to be his enemy, detesting the Norse god's murderous bent, and even the Aesir don't entirely love him. Nonetheless, he dwells with them in Asgard, in a hall called Hlesvang beneath Lake Aegirsholm. Aegir is the grandfather of Heimdall.
