Lu Yueh is the Chinese god of epidemics. He has three fiendish heads and six arms ending in clawed hands, his body covered in green scales and smelling of death and putrescence.
Lu Yueh dwells with Tou Mu in a layer of the Abyss called Feng-Tu, in a mighty citadel constructed on a forked branch of the River Styx called How Nai-ho. The citadel of Feng-Tu is entered through Kuei-Men-Kuan, the Gate of the Demons. The two deities rule over a household of Manes and other demons.
