A carabum is a depraved Baatezu that leads planar travelers to their dooms.
This plump child flutters about on small leathery
wings. It has a mop of unruly black hair and a jovial expression.
Gleaming red eyes stare out beneath a pair of small horns sprouting
from its brow. A string of drool hangs from its lip.
