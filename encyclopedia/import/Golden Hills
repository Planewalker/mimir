The Golden Hills is the name of the connected realms of several of the Gnomish powers in Bytopia's Layer of Dothion. The individual realms are:
* Glitterhome, the realm of Garl Glittergold
* Whisperleaf, the realm of Baervan Wildwanderer
* The Hidden Knoll, the realm of Baravar Cloakshadow
* The Mithral Forge, the realm of Flandal Steelskin
* Stronghaven, the realm of Gaerdal Ironhand
* The Gemstone Burrow, the realm of Segojan Earthcaller
The Golden Hills is a region of rolling hills dominated by one or more larger tors—one for Garl Glittergold and one for each of his fellows. The space among the tors' is a gnome's paradise of small communities, quiet industry, and farms. A single tower or citadel tops each of the tors, containing the audience- and feast-halls where deities receive visitors. In some cases, these very towers have been abandoned as their powerful owners have taken up with wanderlust and sought out new treasures, new adventures, and new ideas. Some of the gnome deities leave guardinals, planetars, and/or solars as caretakers of their tors. Others leave more mundane traps to confound intruders. 
Garl Glittergold has mined out most of the region beneath the tors to provide warrens for gnome Petitioners and forges for craftsmen. Deep within the mines are vortices to the Elemental Plane of Earth and Elemental+Plane+of+Fire, which the gnomes mine and use for energy. As a result, outsiders and elementals from these two planes are more likely to be found near the Golden Hills than elsewhere. All the plant life in this region has a soft, golden tint to it that gives the landscape a soft radiance. Celestial animals are common here, with golden plumage and fur.
