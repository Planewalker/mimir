Alvarez, known as the Purging Duke, is a master of torture who searches the ranks of the tanar'ri incessantly for signs of the taint of Law. As a mere petitioner, he outwitted the nalfeshnee of Woe who judged him, who granted him the memories of his mortal life, and served as a maggot-loving chasme and then a powerful glabrezu assassin before gaining a demonic form closely resembling his living one - a human man with oily blue-black hair.
