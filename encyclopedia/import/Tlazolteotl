Tlazolteotl is the goddess of guilty loves, pleasure, and vice. She is an eater of filth, a sinister seductress who tempts virtuous men to their ruin. She appears in many guises, but in her true form she is a scantily-clad woman of great beauty. Omens from Tlazolteotl include offal raining from the sky, unexplained yearnings, and physical pleasure inappropriate to the circumstance.
She was an ally of the Abyssal+lord Shami-Amourae before that demon's imprisonment.
