Pan is a god of nature and wild passion in the Olympian pantheon. On the one hand he represents the beneficence and fertility of nature, and on the other the fearsome indifferent destructiveness of natural forces. He can be terrifying or delightful, depending on his mood. He takes the form of a satyr. He has a fierce rivalry with Apollo due to competition over the portfoliio of music.
Like Dionysus, he is associated with Bacchae. He was an ally of the Abyssal+lord Shami-Amourae before her imprisonment.
