Arwyl Swan's Son is a paladin and the Factol of the Sons of Mercy Faction and a former Factor of the Mercykillers. After touring the Upper Planes, he became convinced that justice was corrupted by the majority of the Multiverse's governments. Amongst the members of the Red Death he was stymied by the more evilly inclined of his fellow factioneers. Following the Faction War, he left his old faction causing its dissolution as those more goodly aligned joined him and resurrected the Sons of Mercy, while those more evilly aligned did the same with the Sodkillers. He now espouses the belief that justice is better served if there is a good act to balance an evil act, especially if the evildoer reforms and performs a virtuous deed.
