Gem dragons are the dragons of neutrality. Many dwell in the Inner Planes. Their ruler is Sardior. Subspecies include amber, amethyst, crystal, emerald, jacinth, jade, moonstone, pearl, prismatic, sapphire, and topaz dragons. They're charismatic and clever, known for their affinity for Psionics.
The prismatic dragons believe that a creator goddess (whose description matches Hlal) carved the gem dragons from the crystals of an island and breathed life into them. Eventually she found the most beautiful crystal she had ever seen, and made the first prismatic dragon. The other gem dragons, which she had already made, she threw into the sea to drown, though some live on against her will.
