Wildren are a planar race native to the Beastlands.  They are the descendants of dwarf petitioners partially transformed by Beastpox and celestial badgers.  They are found primarily on Karasuthra.
Wildren resemble dwarves covered in dark fur with a white stripe on the top of their heads.  They have large, clawed hands and emit a musky odor.  Wildren rely on scent to identify each other, as well as an amalgam of Common, Dwarven, and Badger.
A wildren's favored class is barbarian, and it has a +1 Level Adjustment.
