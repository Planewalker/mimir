Planar paths are phenomena that move smoothly between the planes with no apparent portals or rifts. Examples include the River Oceanus, River Styx, Mount Olympus, and Yggdrasil.
Planewalkers walk (or sail, or climb, or swim) along a planar path, gradually finding themselves in another plane.
The Infinite Staircase is also classified as a planar path, even though it doesn't fit the earlier definition. The Infinite Staircase has doors on every flight, and one must walk through the doors to get to other planes.
