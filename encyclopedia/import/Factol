Factols are the leaders of factions in Sigil, even though they may have other titles tied to the specific faction they lead. Most were formally factors, but occasionally a popular Factotum can seize control, as happened when Rowan+Darkwood took over the Fated, when Faith took over the Harmonium, or when Spragg took over the Doomguard. The Revolutionary League and Free League have no factols.
