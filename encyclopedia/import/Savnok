Savnok the Instigator is a Vestige explained in the 3e Tome of Magic. He was once a servant of both Heironeous and Hextor before they both came to blows. Heironeous and Hextor were put in charge of looking after the arms and armor of their mother, Stern Alia, while she met with her lovers. Savnok convinced his patrons to let him guard the armor, and when they left he put it on. Once on, the divine armor could not be removed by a mortal, so in panic he fled Stern Alia's realm. The power of the armor corrupted him, and he founded a kingdom with its power, for nothing could pierce Stern Alia's armor.
The divine brothers demanded he remove it before Mom came home and they all got in trouble. Savnok attacked, and though he could not harm the gods, neither could they harm him. Heironeous tried throwing thunderbolts at Savnok, to no effect. Finally Hextor went back home and stole Stern Alia's arrows, and the goddess's arrows successfully pierced the goddess's armor. Savnok was dead. So that they didn't get in trouble, Heironeous and Hextor carefully put the armor and weapons back where they found them and hid Savnok away as a Vestige. Heironeous has always felt guilty about not telling his mother the truth, but he wanted to protect his half-brother Hextor.
