The legends of ancient races speak of a dark and chaotic force that came into this Multiverse from somewhere "outside" (see the Far Realm). So powerful and evil was this force that the powers of the multiverse banded together to defeat this creature, sending it spiralling into the Negative+Energy+Plane. But the destruction was not complete - a part of it still lives, imprisoned in a long-forgotten demiplane. 
The color of this demiplane's ethereal+curtain is unrecorded.
