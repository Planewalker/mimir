Bensozia staunchly supported her mate, Asmodeus. She was
personally the most powerful of the consorts, but her influence was
entirely linked with that of Asmodeus. "Bensozia speks not, save by the
leave of the Great One." Her manner was coldly polite and haughty,
seldom revealing her true feelings. She bore a magical brass scepter.
Bensozia was a 6' tall, statuesque, human-appearing devil with long
white hair, scarlet skin, large glistening black eyes, large brown
hooves, and a forkecd tail, wearing loose black robes with a scarlet
silk lining and a diadem of beaten gold set with large rubies. She was the mother of Glasya.
Levistus ambushed Lady Bensozia while she traveled through Stygia. He
slew her guards and tried to turn her against the Dark Lord. When
Bensozia rebuffed him, he grew angry and slew her. Asmodeus, outraged
by his insolence, imprisoned Levistus inside an iceberg.
