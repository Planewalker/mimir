Neth is a Demiplane filled with oxygen-laden fluid and made from an organic, fleshy membrane the size of a continent folded upon itself. Visitors can swim around, breathing the fluid.
Neth is a sapient creature. It lives. It can extrude small portions of itself, the Children of Neth, to explore the planes and report back to it. It can also absorb visitors, digesting their brain matter and learning everything they know. Neth is insatiably curious, but knows very little about the Multiverse at this time. It hopes to fix that, in part by dispatching pieces of itself, called Neth's+children, to explore the planes.
Neth's ethereal+curtain is a metallic flesh tone.
