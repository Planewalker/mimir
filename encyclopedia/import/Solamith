A corpulent monstrosity at least 10 feet tall lumbers forward on
slablike legs. Rings of flabby flesh cradle its horned head. Pressing
out against the green-veined and pallid skin of its great gut are
screaming faces.
A solamith is a Tanar'ri manifestation of depraved gluttony and burning hunger,
drawing energy from the spirits it devours. That power charges its
flesh with spiritual fire, which it uses against its enemies by tearing
away and hurling bits of its own body.
Solamiths are rare in the Abyss. The few solamiths to be found are usually in the employ of
Balors, and are used to do away with troublesome prisoners and to ward
off attacks by extraplanar threats. Under the watchful guidance of Hezrou commanders, they have great
success as mobile artillery. Particularly successful units tattoo their
kills on their guts.
