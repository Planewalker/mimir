An avatar is the physical manifestation of a Power. The avatar has only a small portion of the deity's essence and abilities, although these are generally beyond the abilities of any but the most powerful of entities. In 2nd ed. a deity could only manifest a certainÂ number of avatars at any one time based god's 'deity level' (greater, intermediate, lesser or demi-). This also affected how long it took the power to replace a slain avatar.
