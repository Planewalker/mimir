Herodias is a baatezu+noble who formally served Geryon; he was banished to Avernus after the Reckoning, when his master fell from favor.
Large and portly, Herodias has a humanoid body of scarlet hue, and massive, muscled arms. He has a small forked tail and small, bat-like (useless) wings. His face is round and sinister and startlingly human in appearance, and his horns are tall, curving inward and then out again like a goatâ€™s. His hooves are black.
