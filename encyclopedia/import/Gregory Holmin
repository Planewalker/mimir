Gregory Holmin (LN male human Wiz6 Fraternity of Order) â€“ 
The former Magistrate of the Bureau of Commerce within the Hall of Information under the Fraternity of Order, Holmin is respected among the business leaders of Sigil, but is also, uncharacteristically for a Guvner, something of a hothead and loose cannon at times. He has been a relatively independent voice on the Sigil Advisory Council, with no allegiances to any other particular members except for perhaps Ustisha Cambris, and occasionally Estavan.
