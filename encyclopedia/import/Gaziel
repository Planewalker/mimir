Gaziel is a baatezu+noble in the service of Belial and Fierana, and leads 11 companies of osyluths into battle when called upon by his mistress or master. He does nothing he does not have to do, and appears to spend much of his time brooding. In battle, Gaziel is cold and mechanical â€” a perfect general, never missing or forgetting any aspect of a skirmish or possible tactic. 
Gaziel has a white, skull-like head with hollow eye sockets and small, curling pink horns, so that from a distance he resembles an osyluth. He has a brown to blood-red hued humanoid body, a red forked tail, and black hooves. His tongue is long, slim, purple-red, and forked. His wrists and knees have bulbous, bony joints, and his elbows have hooked spurs.
