MALGOTH, THE: 
A "terrible entity" that ruled over several layers of the Abyss eons ago, he was finally defeated by a consortium of seven demon lords (Antisif the Befouler, Cyndshyra of the Seven Torments, Felex'ja the Tiger King, Ixinix the Lord of Blackwater, Qij-na the Shattered, Rhindor'zt the Black Prince, and Wejindhastala the Tempest), who led a fantastic assault on his haunted realm. The victorious demons scattered the Malgoth's essence across the Abyss, only to be deposed and ultimately destroyed by underlings on their home layers.
