The justicators resemble 9-foot-tall humans with black and white wings. Their eyes and equipment may be of any metallic hue, from steel blue to gold. Natives of Acheron, they travel the planes opposing Chaos, punishing Eladrins and Tanar'ri with equal gusto. They often work together with the inevitables.
