A duodrone is a blocky, rectangular creature with four spiderlike limbs (two legs and two arms), plus a small set of fanlike wings. It has one central eye and a large mouth.
Duodrones can speak the Modron tongue. They accept orders from tridrones and can give instructions to monodrones, whom they often supervise.
