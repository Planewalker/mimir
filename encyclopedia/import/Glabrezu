Of all the Tanar'ri - demonic fiends that inhabit the Abyss of chaos
and evil - few are as cunning as the doglike glabrezu  (gla-BREET-soo). These are the chosen tempters of mortal minds, offering power and knowledge beyond the ken of even the most knowledgeable. Of course, this knowledge comes with a price. They're also brutal warriors, among the most dangerous creatures you have encountered. Tread carefully, both in body and mind.
