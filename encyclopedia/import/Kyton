Kytons are natives of Baator, hateful creatures covered in chains. Sometimes they're called "chain devils," but this is seen as Clueless by most planars. 
The greatest kyton settlement is Jangling Hiter, the City of Chains in Minauros, Baator's swampy third hell. The city swings from infinitely long, slime-covered iron chains, wracked with rain and sleet. Jangling Hiter's filled with shadows and terror, kytons appearing out of nowhere to inflict suffering on those who venture within. Although the city's nominally under the control of the baatezu, even they are Peery there. 
Kytons are not true Baatezu, and are not part of the baatezu hierarchy. Each of them is considered equal in station to every other kyton, though some of course are more "equal" than others.
