Centeotl is the goddess of agriculture, nature, and maize in the Central American Pantheon. Her male counterpart is called Cinteotl, who shares authority over maize.
Centeotl is a beneficent deity who watches over food crops, but is also the mistress of pain and illness, and has a habit of using her physical charms to their deaths. She does this not out of maliciousness, but because these victims are necessary to ensure the fertility of the crops. She is chaotic neutral. 
Like the rest of her Pantheon, she dwells on an alternate world on the Material+Plane.
