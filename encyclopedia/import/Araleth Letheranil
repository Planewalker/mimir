Araleth, god of light, stars, and twilight,&nbsp;is one of the “Second Born,” those elven gods who came after the first War of Darkness. He is engaged in an eternal war against the powers of darkness, and is known for his relentless pursuit of the drow when they came forth again (indeed, one of the most commonly known stories concerns his battle with Lolth, from which he bears a scar from her poisoned bite). Accordingly, he is often the favorite choice of adventurers because of his aggressive stance.
Araleth resides in Arvandor in the House of Glowing Stars, a dwelling filled with drifting, glowing stars. He works closely with the rest of the Seldarine as needed, and his priests likewise work with other priesthoods in their efforts to eliminate evil.
