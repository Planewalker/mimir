From the Maztica boxed set: 
"Tlalocan, the Water Land, is the top layer of Arcadia. Mazticans
who were killed by water are sent here, a land of gentle rains and
friendly animals. Many consider this a paradise. Legend states that
Azul created this area to please his wife." 
2nd edition Legends &amp; Lore says the same thing about Tlaloc (that he created a paradise called Tlalocan to please his wife).
