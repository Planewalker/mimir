TheÂ Bleak Cabal Faction maintains a citadel in Pandesmos in Pandemonium that serves as a way station for travelers. The Madhouse is a sprawling edifice of haphazardly organized buildings divided by several circular stone walls. The citadel is so large it fills an entire cavern, covering every surface. The place is rife with travelers, Petitioners, and natives. Available services include lodging and most other services one might expect in a normal Burg. However, a respectable percentage of the Madhouse's populace is insane, deaf, or both. Since the Faction War, the Bleakers have called the Madhouse Kip under the leadership of their new Factol, Tyvold.
