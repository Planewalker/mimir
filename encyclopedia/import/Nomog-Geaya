Nomog-Geaya is the god of hobgoblins, the chief general of Maglubiyet. He is one of the toughest of the goblinoid deities, second only to Maglubiyet himself in power. He hates Bargrivyek, who he sees as a weakling, and can barely contain his disgust for Khurgorbaeyag, his greatest rival. Nomog-Geaya exemplifies the hobgoblin traits of coldbloodedness, brutality, courage, and stoicism.
He dwells in Clangor, a Realm in Avalas where Maglubiyet and Khurgorbaeyag also dwells. His center of power there is the giant mesa Redspike, which looks like a giant tower. The hobgoblins dwell in tunnels throughout it, and have constructed two enormous spiral ramps leading to the top.
Nomog-Geaya is described as having ash-gray skin, cold orange eyes, and teeth like a shark.
