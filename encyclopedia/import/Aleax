Aleaxi (singular: aleax) are the physical manifestations of divine vengeance. There is but one aleax for each deity. They take the form of the person a Power intends to punish, they either win or they don't, and their creators uncreate them when they are not in use. 
If the aleax is defeated in battle, the divinity's need for justice is deemed satisfied, as Fate has decreed that the character should survive (at least, for that particular offense).
One who is "slain" by an aleax is actually taken to the realm of the offended god, held in suspension between death and life, and given one last chance to barter for life.
