Raxivort is a lesser deity, worshiped mainly on Oerth, the patron of a blue-skinned, goblinlike race known as xvarts. He is also a patron of bats, rats, and wererats. He is chaotic evil.
Raxivort was formally a servant of Graz'zt, his Master of Slaves. When Graz'zt was least prepared, he struck, attempting to seize control of Graz'zt's Layer of the Abyss, and the two entities warred for several months. Ultimately Raxivort called a truce, and made off to Pandemonium with much of Graz'zt's treasure. 
Today Raxivort dwells in a realm called the Black Sewers in Pandesmos. He sends swarms of rats to Graz'zt's capital city, while Graz'zt sends assassins to kill his hated foe.
