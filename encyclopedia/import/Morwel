Morwel is the queen of the Eladrins. She has titles like Faerie Queen, Queen of Stars, and Lady of the Lake. These shouldn't be taken literally; eladrins are not fey, she doesn't literally live in a star, and she isn't a mermaid or whatever. Instead, they're meant to evoke the mystery and magic that accompany her.
Morwel has two consorts, Faerinaal and Gwynharwyf. Faerinaal is a wise, handsome nobleman and Gwynharwyf is a fierce, fanatic warrior-woman native to the desert layer of Pelion. 
Morwel is not a domineering ruler. The chaotic, independent eladrins wouldn't stand for that. She exists to provide her fractious subjects with inspiration, beauty, and love.
