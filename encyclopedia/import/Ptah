Where Thoth is the Egyptian deity of knowledge and science, Ptah is often viewed as the Power of artists and designers. While the two powers have much in common (neither of them is related to any of the other gods, for instance), there are important differences. An architect planning a pyramid depends on Thoth for the mathematics to build it and calls upon Ptah for the inspiration that will make it a work of art.
In his true form, Ptah appears as a shaven-headed human or dwarf with jet black skin. In his eyes is the fire of creativity that is the inspiration of all artists. Just as Thoth’s priests claim that he created the universe, so, too, do Ptah’s priests exert their claim to the founding waters.
Ptah is a clever and dynamic power with a great love of art and beauty. He smiles upon craftsmen who produce works of great quality and will sometimes send an Avatar to assure that such persons receive the recognition they deserve.
Ptah wanders the Ethereal Plane.
