Uller is a god of the Vanir family of gods, an inhabitant of Vanaheim, where his realm is a forest of yew trees called Ydalir. Chaotic neutral in alignment, he is the patron of hunting, archery, and winter. He was once a greater god, but he has waned to lesser status since the ascension of Odin. Though an outsider to the Aesir pantheon, the Aesir have a high regard for him, and they have been known to allow him to temporarily rule in Odin's place when the high god was elsewhere.
Uller is currently married to Skadi. His mother is Sif. He is closely allied with Artemis.
