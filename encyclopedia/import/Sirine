Sirines are beautiful female creatures, at home in any aquatic environment. They have skin tones ranging from the peach or brown of humans to a light yellow-green. Their hair can be almost any color, though silver and dark green are the most common. 
They can have any alignment, though most sirines hate company and try to drive intruders away. Others are hungry for social interaction and try to lure potential lovers to join them for a time. Sirines usually mate with humans, elves, tritons, or merfolk. Their children inherit traits from both their parents, but they're all girls, and all true sirines. They're cared for until the age of five, at which point they're left to fend for themselves. They become fully grown at the age of ten. Sirines never form lasting relationships.
The poison of a sirine's touch reduces their victims to the intelligence of animals. Sirines have various spell-like abilities as well, allowing them to summon fog, charm, change their shape, and turn invisible. The Pearl of the sirines makes its owner immune to their touch.
Sirines love to sing and contemplate the currents - if deprived of their voices or confined away from water, they slowly wither until they die. Sirines often have great knowledge, and sometimes trade it in return for company. 
Some are found in the City of Glass.
