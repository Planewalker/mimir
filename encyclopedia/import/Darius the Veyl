The factol of the Sign of One, Darius the Veyl grew up in the realm of Tir na Og, on the shores of the great sea Feyliriel.  Unlike many of the factols, who are typically driven focused personalities, Darius seems soft and unfocused.  Her graceful presence, dark olive skin, and flawless complexion hold a body's attention, though, and those that've spoken to her say that at fleeting moments her gaze seems to harden and become steady. 
Darius' home village was destroyed by a Blood War incursion, the same one that earned Erin+Darkflame the emnity of an Abyssal+lord. With her village destroyed, and no people left to tend to, Darius wandered the planes for a time and eventually fell in with the Sign of One.  Her powers of divination served her well in Sigil's political arena, and she proved herself to be a potent dreamer.  Indeed, many Signers say she achieved her position in the faction by imagining herself there.
As the factol, Darius served the Sign of One well.  Less self-centered than most Signers, she ran the Hall of Speakers with an even and fair hand.  Among her faction, she promotes enhancing the faction's empathic abilities, and their tolerance for diversity. 
Her followers have been told she ascended to a higher state of being during the Faction War, but it's all a Peel. She's currently in a Maze, the same one that Factol Vergrove of the Godsmen is trapped in. The Githyanki Djek'Nlarr recently saw them both while mapping the maze. If freed, the factols will want to disband the Mind's Eye. The Mind's Eye faction is trying to keep this secret under wraps.
