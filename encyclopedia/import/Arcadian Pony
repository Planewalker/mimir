Arcandian ponies are natives of the Plane of Arcadia. They appear as standard Prime ponies save they have a tentacle in the middle of their chest. They are also found in Sigil drawing carts through the Cage, their tentacle coming in handy in the darker parts of the Burg where it used to carry a torch for lighting.
