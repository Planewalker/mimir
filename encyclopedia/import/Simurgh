The simurgh, the King of the Birds, is known to aid and protect other lawful good beings. It is peaceful and friendly, helpful and kind to all good creatures.
In its natural form, a simurgh has a male or female human face and the body of an enormous eagle with orange metallic feathers. Two pairs of golden wings sprout from its back, and its long tail feathers put a peacock's to shame. Simurghs speak the languages of all birds and creatures of the air, including air+elementals. They're usually accompanied by "courts" of admiring birds. 65% of simurghs are female.
