Nalfeshnee (nal-FESH-nee) are judges of the damned, true Tanar'ri who shape the souls of those who enter the Abyss after death to whatever suits their chaotic whims. Chimerical creatures, they combine the worst features of boar and ape, and have feathered wings.
Nalfeshnee send the souls they transform to the balors to fight in the Blood War. They consider themselves superior to the balors, and sometimes send them deficient troops out of spite.
