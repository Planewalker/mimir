Observers[/b] are beholder-kin native to Acheron, Mechanus, and the Outlands. They have frightening alien intellects and fearsome spell-like and psionic powers.Â  They create small tyrannies, using their abilities to take control of regions and impose their own order upon them. Like spectators, they alternate between guarding their territories and exploring the planes in search of knowledge.
Although extremely lawful, they are much more neutral in alignment than most beholders, lacking the expansionist, genocidal urges of the majority of their kind. Observers are slightly larger than beholders, with three mouths and three eyes spaced evenly around their bodies as well as six eyestalks on top.
