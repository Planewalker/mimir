These are energy creatures, swirling mists of light and rainbow colors. Gazing within them, good folk see memories of moments they're proud of, while evil folk see the better lives they might have led. Or so it's said.
Lights, like other Aasimon, are created by the powers of the Upper Planes. Lights act as companions for high-level paladins and the like.
