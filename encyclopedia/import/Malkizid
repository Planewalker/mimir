He was seduced into betraying his patron by Lolth and fell. When Lolth's rebellion failed, Malkizid was branded and cast into Baator. He arose as a prince there, quickly carving out his own kingdom. 
Thousands of years ago, Malkizid earned the disfavor of the Dark+Lord+of+Nessus and was exiled from the plane along with a small host of Baatezu. The Branded King, as he was known, settled for building an infernal realm in the pits of the Yugoloths. He is served both by the baatezu who followed him and by lesser yugoloths in the pits of Gehenna.
Malkizid is clever, hateful, and patient. He despises Lolth and the Drow, and hates and fears Corellon for not showing him mercy all those years ago. He mostly sits around trying to figure out ways to make elves of all kinds as miserable as possible.
Physically, Malkizid is much changed from his original celestial appearance: nearly ten feet tall, his skin marble-white, his two huge wings shedding shabby gray feathers. His hands and feet are gray with scaly, birdlike talons, and he has a long, serpentine tail. Small black horns poke from his long gray mane. His eyes are cold black pits, and a large, complex sigil has been branded across his face, weeping trickles of foul blood.
