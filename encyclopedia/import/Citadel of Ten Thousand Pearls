The Citadel of Ten Thousand Pearls is the capital of the marids, a collection of domes made to look like giant mollusk shells built on a vast, circular coral reef floating freely in the Elemental+Plane of Water, lit by glowing orbs and decorative fish. 
The Citadel holds the court of Kalbari al-Durrat al-Amwaj ibn Jari, Great Padishah of the Marids, and those nobles of her court who find it amusing enough to attend. All marids consider themselves to be nobles.
