Planar half-elves[/b] are usually the offspring of planar humans and prime elves. They're both more rare than the half-elves of the Material+Plane and seem less unusual, since, although planar elves seldom leave the realms of their powers to fraternize with mere humans, and planar humans seldom fraternize with mere primes, half-elves just don't seem that exotic on the planes. With tieflings and Genasi and the like around, an elf/human hybrid doesn't raise an eyebrow. 
They're still worthy characters, of course, and they have as many bloods among 'em as any other race, proportionately speaking.
