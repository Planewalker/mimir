The Seven Spiritors are the mysterious rulers of Sylvania, incorporeal beings who possess corporeal hosts. They are neither undead, nor petitioners, nor gods; they are, instead, eternal concepts who call the Gate-town of Sylvania their home.
Their names reflect their natures: Thought, Knowledge, Action, Passion, Reflection, Pain, and Rest. Their hosts are mortals of various races and genders. Thought is currently within a female bariaur, Knowledge is within a human male, Action makes a female halfling its home, Passion is a male elf, Pain is a human male, and Rest is a human female.
They wander throughout the town, having no permanent palace or center of operations.
