Dark versions of the serpents of the Material+Plane, they often guard the tombs of kings and other important members of royal families. The average shadow asp is 4 feet long, nearly translucent due to its ability to become incorporeal. Those slain by the venom of a shadow asp rise as undead+shadows.
