Belisama (of the Celtic Pantheon) seems to have been the female counterpart of the smith-god Goibhniu, and may be the same as Brigit. The Romans equated her with Minerva (see Athena).
She was the patron deity of metalworking arts, probably invoked when starting out to make an item which was intended to be beautiful as well as practical.
