Rule-of-Three is generally found in the Lower Ward at the Styx+Oarsman. Rule-of-Three appears to be an aged Githzerai, but in reality is a Cambion. He's a former worshiper of Loki, and a servant of Graz'zt. He learns things no one else knows from Patch, the sentient razorvine.
Rule-of-Three's name is a reference to one of the trio of 'rules' or 'patterns' of the Planes. The "rule of three" is that events occur in trios, where two are found, look for the third.
Rule-of-Three also displays a particular speaking pattern in which he speaks and deals only in triplicates. Three word sentences, three sentences to a speech. He prefers to be paid in triplicates such as three Soul-gems, or three pieces of gold. Presumably, the more threes you can work into a conversation with him the better he will treat you. Or maybe not.
