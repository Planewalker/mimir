SUMERIAN PANTHEON (Lords of the Eastern Heights)
The Sumerian pantheon is small but mighty, with four greater powers among them. They're said to've been born when Enlil rose from Nammu the sea. Enlil, Ki, and Nin-Hursag dwell on the Great Mountain of the East, the mightiest peak in Elysium.
The Sumerians are unthinkably ancient, so ancient another pantheon, the Babylonian mythos, has grown from them. The Sumerians are more interested in elemental forces, while the Babylonians more concerned with order and law.
The Sumerian gods are very close to their worshippers, more willing to intervene personally - both to help and to punish - than most others. Clerics of this pantheon shave all hair from their bodies and wear kilts and robes of white with colorful borders.
