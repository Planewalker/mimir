The ungulosin is a protective spirit of the water found on the Elemental Plane of Water. Ungulosins take their shape from a swarm of fish, eels, octopuses and so forth, forcing them to act in concert. They do not misuse this power. They have no place in the hierarchy of the elementals, acting as a rogue, doing as they please.
It's said they were once air spirits that were somehow betrayed by a power of the sky, fleeing in succession to the Elemental Plane of Earth, [Elemental Plane of Fire]], and finally the Plane of Water over the course of eons, using makeshift living bodies to replace the elemental forms they've shed.
