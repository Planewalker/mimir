Mount Othrys is the highest peak on Carceri's first Layer, Othrys. Here lies a monstrously huge palace of white marble columns, amphitheaters, and galleries. It is the Realm of the Titans, banished from the Prime Material Plane long ago by Arborea's Olympians. Mount Othrys's lord is the Titan, Cronus, who resides at the center of his palace in a throne room a mile wide. Visitors may seek audiences with Cronus to hear his wisdom, but those who seek such counsel must be always aware that the titan's eons-long anger at his confinement may lash out unexpectedly at those who can come and go at their leisure. Cronus has the power of a lesser Power for the purposes of altering Mount Othrys.
