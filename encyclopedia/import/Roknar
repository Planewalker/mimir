Roknar the Tempter claims to be Moradin's brother. Moradin's clerics
say that he's not truly a dwarf at all, but an ancient evil that took
dwarf form shortly after the All-Father created the dwarves. Roknar
urges his followers to delve deep into the earth and takes its
treasures for themselves. "Power and wealth is all that matters,"
teaches Roknar, "and only the weak forego the chance to grab more for
themselves."
