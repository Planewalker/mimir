Enlil is a greater Sumerian god of air and war. He is the boundary between Heaven and Earth, the very breath within his worshippers' lungs. He is neutral good, and dwells in Elysium, in the Great Mountain of the East in Eronia, with Nin-Hursag and Ki. He usually appears as a tall human with a heavy dark beard and curly hair, though he is a shapeshifter. In battle he wears a war-helm that is thought to be immune to all conceivable forms of harm, and carries a magic-destroying axe carved from stone.
Enlil's sacred animal is the raven. His colors are red and white. His holy days fall on the full moon, where he demands a tithe of precious stones for his temples.
He has sworn vengeance on Anshar and Nergal for their slaying of Enki, and rewards the slaying of Babylonian proxies handsomely. In Toril he had a son, Gilgeam.
