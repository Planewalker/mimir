Leonals are the wisest and most powerful of the guardinals.  They're chieftains and leaders wherever guardinals gather. They resemble tall, muscular humans with short tawny fur and a great mane of hair (at least, the males). 
Leonals are most at home in the wilds of Eronia, but they're found throughout Elysium. Leonals tend to keep to themselves, roaming the forests and mountains. They use their authority over other guardinals carefully and only when they feel a matter can't be attended to personally.
