Although Amon is also the name of a baatezu+noble, practitioners of Pact magic believe Amon was once a deity of light and justice who died of neglect because he was nonresponsive to his worshippers (this description sounds exactly like Amaunator - ed.).  His strong will preserved him as a Vestige, but countless years trapped in the space between realities has warped his personality, and now he is bitter and vengeful.
Amon hates the other Vestiges Chupoclops, Eurynome, Karsus, and Leraje for reasons unknown.
