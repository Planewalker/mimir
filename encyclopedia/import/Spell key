Spell keys are augmentaions to individual arcane spells or, more rarely, whole schools of spells, which attunes the spell so as to bypass restrictions caused by a particular Plane. They take many different forms dependent on the spell, school and plane involved, being an additional verbal, somantic or material component. For instance, for Ysgard, spell keys take on the form of runes traced in the air while casting the spell while for Mechanus they take the form of a cryptic formula written on a small cog.
