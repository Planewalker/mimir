Like their cousins the fire+elementals, flame spirits are native to the Elemental+Plane+of+Fire. They look like pulsating balls of flame; a snaky tendril of fire, about five feet long, continually emerges from random areas of the creature's body. The colored flames of a flame spirit are an ever-shifting pattern of yellow, red, and green. It has no facial features aside from two deep red ovals, which serve as eyes. They speak Ignan in voices like hissing steam.
Flame spirits cannot cross water or other noncombustible liquids. Greater flame spirits enjoy eating seasoned wood and fresh parchment. Lesser flame spirits can consume only volcanic ash, basalt, and other volcanic rock. Least flame spirits are relatively docile and are content to be used as lamps as long as they're given any combustible materials as food. 
On their home plane, they often dwell in mixed-race communities with fire+elementals, fire+minions and other natives of Fire.
