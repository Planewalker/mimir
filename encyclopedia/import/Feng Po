Feng Po is a demigod of the Chinese Pantheon. Like Fei Lien, he is one of the Counts of the Wind, and dwells with him on the Elemental Plane of Air.
This deity is a man-shaped being with jet-black skin, fiery eyes, and
tusks, wearing plate mail and riding the wind itself. He fights in all
major battles of the Chinese gods, and often acts as a go-between
between gods and men.
