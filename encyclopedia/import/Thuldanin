Thuldanin is an infinite junkyard for weapons and machines of war scattered across a terrain much like that of Avalas - dark iron cubes floating in windy space. Rust Dragons and rust+monsters crawl through the trash, and gray dwarves mine it for things they can use. The realms of the gods Deep Duerra and Laduguer are both found here.
Thuldanin is the second Layer of Acheron.
