Bele serves Mephistopheles as justiciar of Cania, spending most of his time in the fortress of Mephistar, dispensing impartial justice within the realm. Some in Cania (among the pit+fiends) openly doubt if Bele’s justice is impartial — but it is true that Mephistopheles does not intervene on a case-by-case basis to overrule or influence his judgements. Mephistopheles and Bele do agree upon (and periodically discuss) the basic principles and some specific details of what precisely “justice,” in Cania, is and should be. As a result, Bele’s judgments are opposed to any rebellious or disorderly actions, although they occasionally stand against Mephistopheles’ orders. Perhaps the most important fact in the matter is that Bele would not have his present office without the permission of Mephistopheles; if Bele’s judgments ever run too much against his master’s will, that office will end. 
Bele appears as a tall, handsome, hollow-eyed man with ivory skin, a curling beard and pencil-thin mustache, a low, nasal voice, tiny horns, and long black robes. Beneath the robes are concealed a short forked tail, a crimson-skinned lower torso, and a belt bearing Bele’s black rod of office and a dagger of venom. When Bele disrobes, his leathery wings can spread to a surprisingly large (20’) wingspan.
