Ulaa is sort of a gnomish, but also a dwarven, power of Hills, Mountains, and Gemstones. She is the wife of Bleredd, and an ally of Beory and Tarsellis Meunniduin. She resembles a dwarf-gnome hybrid. She's mostly worshipped on the world of Oerth.
Her Realm on the Outlands is called the Steel Hills, though she is also said to dwell in Mount Celestia, for she is lawful good in alignment.
