A triton is roughly human-sized. Its lower half ends in two finned legs, while its torso, head, and arms are human. Tritons have silvery skin that fades into silver-blue scales on the lower hald of their bodies. Their hair is deep blue or blue-green. The reclusive tritons prefer to avoid combat, but they fiercely defend their homes. They are known to ride hippocampi. 
The tritons may be found on both the Elemental Plane of Water and the Prime Material Plane. Their chief god is Persana.
