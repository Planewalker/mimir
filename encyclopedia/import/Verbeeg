Verbeegs are giant-kin who inhabit areas infested with hill giants, ogres, and fomorians. They range in height from eight and a half to ten feet tall, weighing between 300 to 400 pounds (making them unusually thin for their height). Some have minor deformities such as club feet, uneven eyeus, hairlips, and so on. In most other respects, they appear human. 
Verbeegs maintain a mutually beneficial relationship with giants and ogres that share their lairs. They provide the intelligence and direction that the other giants lack, and the giants provide protection with their greater fighting prowess. 
The patron deity of verbeegs is Karontor. Some say Karontor is their creator, while others say they are among those giants descended from Othea's affair with Ulutiu.
