The Center of the Multiverse is a place that doesn't exist; the Multiverse has no true center. It's infinite, Berk. No matter where you are, that's the center of the multiverse from your perspective.
Some call Sigil the Center, due to its doors and bein' on top of that Spire an all, but they're just rattling their bone-boxes.
