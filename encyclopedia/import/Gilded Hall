The Gilded Hall is a palace in the first Layer of Arborea. Prior to the Faction War, Sensates who refused to try new sensations or indulged too often in repetitive experiments were sent to the Gilded Hall, damned to eternal pleasure and delight at the cost of missing out on the many truly worthwhile experiences to be found in the Multiverse outside it. Following the war, Cuatha Da'nanin led a large number of Sensates to the Gilded Hall, set up kip there and became the Faction's new Factol. The Gilded Hall now acts as the faction's new headquarters, although a large number of Sensates can still be found in Sigil, in and around the Civic Festhall. 
The Gilded Hall is truly a place of beauty, an overwhelming, thundering glory said to have been carved by Aphrodite herself. Fiends have been killed at the very sight of it. The elves call it Perlamia, and say their goddess Hanali had a hand in building it.
