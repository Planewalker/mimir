The first son of Tefnut and Shu, Geb is married to his sister Nut.
Geb dwells in the Caverns Under the Stars in the Elemental+Plane of Earth. The caverns are so great that, combined with the workmanship of Nut, they resemble the night sky.
Geb deeply misses his wife Nut, though she dwells in Elysium and their father Shu has forbidden them to meet.
