Broken Reach is a town in the Plain of Infinite Portals, the first Layer of the Abyss. It serves as a gathering point for Blood War mercenaries, a way station for travelers, and a place for trade. It contains the portal leading to Plague-Mort, making Broken Reach a Gate-town as well.
Broken Reach is ruled by a succubus sorcerer named Red Shroud. Physically it's a set of crumbling towers with heavily defended walls, trenches, and spiky barricades. The town has extensive dungeons.
