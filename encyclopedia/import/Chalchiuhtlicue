This Aztec Power, whose name means "Goddess of the Jade Petticoat," was matron of lakes and streams. A personification of youthful beauty and ardour, Chalchiuhtlicue was represented as a river from which grew a prickly pear tree laden with fruit, symbolising the human heart. She ruled over all the waters of the earth; oceans, rivers, rain, etc., but was also associated with marriage. Her husband is Tlaloc, the god of rain. She unleashed the flood (to punish the wicked) that the destroyed the fourth world (according to the Aztec, we are in the fifth world).
