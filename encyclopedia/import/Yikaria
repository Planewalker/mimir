The yikaria, or yak-men or yakfolk, are a race of bestial-looking humanoids native to the mountains of Zakhara on the Prime+Material world of Toril. They're also found in the Yatil Mountains on Oerth. Their patron deity, the Faceless God, won a wager with the Great Khan of the Dao resulting in the dao being enslaved to the yikaria for a thousand years.
