Typhus was once a humble Mezzoloth transformed into a new form of creature by Night Hags who needed a champion against the armies of Mellifleur, who was slaying night hags by the thousands in an attempt to corner the Larva trade.
Typhus has one of the greatest combat minds on the planes, but at a serious cost to wisdom. He commands a rag-tag army called the Infernal Front.
