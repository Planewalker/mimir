Inevitables are constructs native to Mechanus. Each caste of inevitables protects a different law: the zelekhuts catch fugitives, the kolyaruts enforce oaths, maruts hunt those down who would defy mortality, quaruts protect time and space from those who would disrupt them, and varakhuts protect the powers themselves. Inevitables are made in factories called cr√©che-forges, such as Neumannus.
