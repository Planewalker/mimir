Bralm, called the Toiling Lady and the Hive Goddess, is a patron of insects and industry who dwells in war-torn Avalas, the first Layer of Acheron, in a stronghold she calls the Hive Fortress.
She is friendly with the rest of the Suel+pantheon, but has no close allies. She is an enemy of Trithereon and avoids Pyremius and Joramy because she dislikes fire.
