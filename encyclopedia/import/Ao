Ao is the Overpower of the world of Toril and the planets of its surrounding Crystal sphere. He determines who rises to divinity and which gods from other worlds are permitted to establish themselves there. A few decades back he banished all the gods of Toril from the Outer Planes, imprisoning them in Avatar form in punishment for stealing an artifact called the Tablets of Destiny. Those who had presences in multiple spheres had only their Torilian aspect imprisoned. 
Ao seems to have a superior, outranking even him. Nothing about this superior is known.
