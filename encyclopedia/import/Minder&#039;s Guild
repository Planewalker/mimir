The bold">Minder's+Guild</span> (named after the Cant word for bodyguard, Minder) is the Sodkiller faction as it's organized in Sigil. When the Lady of Pain told all the factols that their factions weren't welcome in the city anymore (this happened after the Faction War), she didn't say anything about new factions. But the Sodkillers weren't really ready to risk her wrath, so they took pains to establish that they weren't a faction, no, they're just a guild.
Other factions have done similar things. The Sensates formed the Entertainer's Guild, for example, and the Dustmen are acting like a guild as well. 
Nobody's stopped believing, but they're organized differently. That's all.
