Tempestans are small elementals related to lightning. They are unruly creatures, concerned with exalting the air and storm and caring nothing for manners or the welfare of others. They have psionic powers connected to air and lightning. They mostly live alone.
Tempestans are humanoid-looking, with angular gray bodies surrounded by gray clouds. Their eyes spark with electricity.
