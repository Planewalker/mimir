Lilis, the consort of Dispater, is one of the older and weaker female archdevils, but her
careful diplomacy and strategies and attention to detail in the hells
and elsewhere (and her vast network of spies) has kept her position as
secure as any. Lilis has orange-red skin, copper-colored hair, and
green eyes. She looks like a short, plump, well-preserved human female
of middle age except for the hue of her skin, her tiny orange-red
horns, long red nails, forked tail, wings, and delicate cloven black
hooves. She is only five feet tall.
