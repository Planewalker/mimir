Elo√©le is the goddess of thieves and the night in the Cerilian pantheon, the daughter of Sera and Ruornil. She shares her realm, the City of Eternal Darkness, with Anshar of the Babylonian mythos. Her part of the realm is an endless maze of streets, alleys, and squares filled with taverns, brothels, and gambling halls where her petitioners are allowed to fulfill their every fantasy. The Realm is located in Pandesmos.
