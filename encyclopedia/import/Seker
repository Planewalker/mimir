Seker, god of light in the Egyptian pantheon, appears as a rather ordinary man. He is relentless in his quest to destroy all evil. He is also one of the gods of the underworld, protecting neutral good souls after death. 
He is a cousin of Shu. His Realm in Elysium is called Ro Stau, which means Doors of the Corridors. His realm can be moved by Seker's will from Layer to layer, its shining surface bringing the light of the day when it is in flight. Seker and his realm spend most of their time in Amoria adjacent to Quietude (Isis' realm), or among the Isles of the Blessed in Thalasia. In Amoria it's a beautiful marble palace rising from the desert, and in Thalasia it's a pleasure house along the banks of a thundering river.
