Marketed as "A Planescape Reunion," Beyond Countless Doorways was written by Planescape designers Monte Cook, Wolfgang Baur, Ray Vallese, and Colin McComb. It was published in 2004 by Malhavoc Press. 
While it presented its own cosmology different from Planescape's, the many worlds, demiplanes, and realms detailed in the book are easily adaptable to the Planescape Multiverse.
