Chih-Chiang Fyu-Ya is a Chinese god of archers, and the punisher of offenses against the gods.
This deity has fiery red, scaly skin, a black fiendish tusked head, large batlike wings, a humanoid body, and cloven hooves. He dwells in Gehenna. In his throne, at the highest point of a tall citadel, he sits and waits to be called to deal out judgement. A great temple bell carved from a giant's skull hangs behind his throne. When Chih-Chiang Fyu-Ya is called, the tolling of the bell sounds throughout the slopes of Khalas. 
Chih-Chiang Fyu-Ya is particularly likely to be called to punish the desecration of temples.
