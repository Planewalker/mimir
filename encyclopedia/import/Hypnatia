Hypnatia is a greater goddess of slumber and dreams, appearing to mortals as a woman with long, flowing hair that streams into the darkness behind her. She rules from her crystalline castle in the Region of Dreams.
She is said to have thousands of children who work dreams, taming nightmares and hunting Night Hags, but her most notable children are Phobetor and Phantasia.
