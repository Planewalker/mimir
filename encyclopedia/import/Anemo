Anemos, lawful air+elementals, are cottony-looking creatures consisting of a complex and ordered network of off-white fibers. Their extremely light bodies enable them to perform unbelievably dexterous aerial maneuvers. Each anemo works closely with others of its kind, forever attempting to catalogue and order all of existence. These creatures are the most likely of all elementals of law to be found outside their home plane.
