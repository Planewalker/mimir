Jormungandr is the Midgard Serpent of Norse myth, son of Loki and Angur-boda. After Odin tossed him in the ocean, he grew so big he encircled the world. After Ragnarok, Thor will kill him only to die himself.
Jormungandr has one known offspring, the Midgard linnorm, a 500' serpentine dragon that lives at the bottom of the ocean.
