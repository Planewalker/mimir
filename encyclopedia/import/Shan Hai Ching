Shan Hai Ching's Realm in Mechanus is on a wheel that interlocks with that of Yu-Huang-Shang-Ti. The water of his realm provides the irrigation for Shang-Ti's peaches of immortality. His wheel is full of water, and many sea creatures make their home there. A fair wind is always blowing in this domain.
