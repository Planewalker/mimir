The timeless god of the treants, Emmantiensien is a god of the World Tree archetype (like Yggdrasil, and possibly Rilifane+Rallathil), with no origin in time; he has always existed. His roots are curled about a magic crystal fashioned by some unnamed and unknown god. He is the sage of the Seelie+Court.
