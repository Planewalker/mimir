The Nameless One is the protagonist of Plugin &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Not Found, a scarred, gray-skinned immortal. He has had many different incarnations, both good and bad, but every time he dies he loses his memories and starts with a moral clean slate - at least, until the game begins.
Nameless' complete history is only given in hints, but it stretches many centuries at least, probably much more. During his first lifetime he committed some great crime that damned him to the Lower Planes, and to escape it he made a bargain with a Night Hag, Ravel Puzzlewell, to take away his mortality. 
In the paperback novel version of the story by Ray and Valerie Vallese - which differs from the RPG version - the Nameless One is named  Hra'ka'lothanek by the Githzerai Dak'kon, or Thane for short.
Due to the past relationship with Dak'kon and certain dialogue within the game, some have speculated that the Nameless One may have in fact been Zerthimon in a previous incarnation and that his great crime was the Pronouncement of Two Skies, which sundered the race and led to war. However, Chris Avellone has stated that this is not the case, and that no one really knows who the Nameless One is or what his sins were.
