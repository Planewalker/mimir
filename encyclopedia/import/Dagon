Dagon is an Obyrith lord, known as the Prince of the Darkened Depths. His Realm is Shadowsea, catalogued as the 89th Layer of the+Abyss. It lies directly beneath the realm of Demogorgon, who is an ally of sorts.
Dagon is served by wastriliths, Hezrou, aquatic dretches, krakens, Uzollru, and horrible fish-monsters. His form is a maddening combination of shark, octopus, and more alien things. 
Dagon is also the name of a baatezu+noble currently exiled to Avernus. See Dagon (archdevil).
