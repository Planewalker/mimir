Tsolorandril is an obscure hero-deity that wanders the Ethereal Plane. It is a sexless, alien creature from a far-off world, though it is known by a few on Oerth. Tsolorandril sees itself as a record-keeper, noting the rise and fall of politics, time, and nature, often across planar boundaries. It appears as a tall, androgynous humanoid with very white skin, muted features, and silver-white hair, carrying a silver rope that bends as if it were liquid.
It is thought to be a servant of Cyndor. It is lawful neutral.
