The Hive Ward, often simply called the Hive, is the poorest of Sigil's six wards, a slum so terrible that in many areas it makes the Lower Planes look good. The muddy, unpaved streets and alleys are choked with garbage, offal, treacherous portals to the Paraelemental+Plane of Ooze, wretched homeless people, cripples, corpses, drug addicts, muggers, criminal gangs, prostitutes, and ramshackle impromptu housing built wherever there is room. Sigil's police fear to enter the Hive. In one of the worst areas is the Gatehouse, where the Bleak Cabal need only look out their narrow, barred windows to prove the Multiverse is mad. The Slags are a region ruined and tainted by evil due to an incursion by the Blood War, and living weapons of the Tanar'ri still lurk among the ruins.
It's not all that bad, however. The Chaos District, where Xaositects congregate, is full of bohemians and artists reveling in the cheap rent and freedom from restrictions. The neighborhood around the city Mortuary is compatively peaceful and clean, albeit a bit dead. Darkwell Court is well protected by xenophobic Githzerai, and New Tyr is patrolled by tested warriors native to the desert world of Athas. If there is justice in the Hive Ward, its inhabitants have to provide it themselves.
