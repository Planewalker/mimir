Bahamut the Platinum Dragon is the ruler and creator of all good dragons. He appears, not surprisingly, as a great platinum scaled dragon. He is a Power of wisdom and is attended by seven Gold Wyrms. His arch nemisis is Tiamat, Queen of Evil Dragonkind. His Realm, Bahamut's Palace, may be found floating between the first four layers of Mount Celestia.
