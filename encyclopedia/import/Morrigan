Morrigan, or more correctly the Morrigan, is the Celtic Power of war. She is a fearsome warrior, causing great fear in her opponents, driving home her own battles with a spear in either hand. She is terribly ugly, laughs a maniacal laugh, and has dreadful manners. She expects all Celts and especially her followers to fight constantly, encouraging petty wars where there otherwise would be none. She can shape change to fool her opponents, and often calls upon four minor goddesses of war - Macha, Fen, Neman, and Badb - to fight by her side. At one time, Morrigan tried to seduce the hero Cu Chulainn, but on failure she turned against him and nearly killed him.
Morrigan is bent on warfare every turn. She will readily pick fights, preferring to get mortals to fight each other by whatever means. She will use many forms to trick otherwise peaceful parties into conflict. Morrigan often observes battles and will not tolerate fear among her followers â€” she will strike dead any follower that turns and flees from a battle she is watching.
She resides in Tir na Og in the Outlands - her territory there is called the Bloody Field, and her Petitioners there fight and fight for all eternity. If they die, they come back to life to fight some more, though visitors ain't so lucky.
