Skall is an ancient being that's been around long enough to see whole civilizations rise and fall, and that means he's not likely to go anywhere anytime soon.  He was, prior to his mazing during the Faction War, the Factol of the Dustmen. In fact, he was its founder. He knows his faction inside and out, and above all he knows how to stay alive, or at least stay undead.  Skall isn't alive or, well, he'd be dead by now, so that can only mean one thing for member of the Dustmen: undeath.  The Dark of the matter is that Skall's a lich, and has been for thousands of years.  Rumor says that he keeps his phylactery hidden in the Dustmen's headquarters on the Negative+Energy+plane. He is the author of the philosophy of True Death.
