Persana is the god of tritons, said to have created them from elemental water from the fountain of the Elemental Plane of Water. He encourages his people to build cities and great buildings, but cares little for things not directly related to his race. He is willing to act as a servitor to greater powers in exchange for concessions toward his chosen people. 
He is an intermediate deity, neutral with neutral good tendencies. He was formally a wandering power, but has taken residence in Eadro's realm Shelluria since the disappearance of the merfolk god.
