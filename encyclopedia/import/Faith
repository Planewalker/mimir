Faith is a priestess of St. Cuthbert and the current Factol of the Harmonium. She became the leader of the Faction following the death of her husband, the former factol, Sarin, and the faction's retreat to Melodia after the Faction War. She has set an agenda for the faction to follow a truer path of harmony than in previous years by acting more in line with the tenets of Arcadia and has purged the faction of its more evilly inclined members.
