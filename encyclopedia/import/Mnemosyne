Mnemosyne, the Titan of Memory, is one of the twelve titans imprisoned in Carceri. She was the last to be imprisoned. For a time she was the wife of Zeus (his fifth), and by him she became the mother of the nine muses. Ultimately, though, he tired of her and cast her in Carceri with her brothers and sisters.
She holds a grudge against Zeus and, with her sister Themis, seeks a way to escape while leaving their brother Cronus behind.
