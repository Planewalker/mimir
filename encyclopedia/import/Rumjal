Expelled from the hierarchy of the hells for the molestation of Geryonâ€™s consort Cozbinaer, Rumjal is a proud and bitter exiled baatezu+noble, formally Geryon's lieutenant, who delights in tormenting lemures, lesser Baatezu, and non-diabolic visitors to Avernus. 
Rumjal still considers himself a legitimate member of the Baatezu hierarchy who has been temporarily displaced by a fall from favor. He acts accordingly, hoping that the loyalty and usefulness of his actions will restore him to his rightful place in the hierarchy (and he may be right - it is said that Asmodeus likes Rumjal and doesn't wish him harmed). Rumjal, although a cruel prankster and an admirer of wit, art, and poetry, will let nothing sway him from the course of action that a loyal scion of the hells would take. He will never fawn or flatter when dealing with archdevils or other dukes, although he is always polite and generally good-natured; he deals with all other devils as equals. He often remarks that Asmodeus used to enjoy a good game of chess with him, and this is true. 
Rumjal appears as a tall, muscular, hairless, slate-grey humanoid with a cruel, grinning human visage, dead-white curving horns, and bat wings. He has a prehensile tail of the same dead-white hue that splits at its end into three back-curving, barbed points, like a fishhook.
