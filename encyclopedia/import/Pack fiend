Used as hunting beasts by both sides of the Blood War, pack fiends roam freely throught the Gray Waste. Night Hags relish them as pets, and pit+fiends and Glabrezu have been known to keep kennels of starving ones.
They resemble crosses betwen cockroaches and wolves, with skull-like faces and scorpion-like tails.
