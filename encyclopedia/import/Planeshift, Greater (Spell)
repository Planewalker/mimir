This spell functions like plane shift, except that if you have visited the desired location, the spell takes you to the precise location (rather than 5 to 500 miles distant).
This makes return trips quite viable for planewalkers just shy of any gate ability or who doesn't want to haggle with those sometimes pesky portal guardians.
