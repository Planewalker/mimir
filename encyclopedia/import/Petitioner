A Petitioner is a mortal who has passed on and whose soul or spirit has reformed on the plane of his alignment and/or Power, usually without memory of his or her former life.
If a petitioner is slain on its own plane, its essence merges with that of the plane in general or its patron Power, if any. If slain off the plane, though, the energies dissipate, never to be seen or heard from again. Most petitioners never leave their plane for this reason.
The planes shape their petitioners to fit the nature of that plane. For example, on the Beastlands, petitioners take the form of sentient animals. On Mount Celestia, they begin as lantern Archons, in the Gray Waste they often become Larvae, and so on and so forth.
