Wizards: How does the shadow magic system function? What precisely is the difference between a mystery and a standard spell?
Matthew: Mysteries and spells share many
similarities, but as you gain levels and your connection to the [[Plane
of Shadow]] grows, mysteries become easier to cast, changing from spells
to spell-like abilities, and finally to supernatural abilities.
Mysteries follow certain paths of philosophy, and a shadowcaster can be
a jack-of-all-trades or a specialist.
Wizards: How does shadow magic differ from (or interact with) the shadow subschool of Illusion spells? Does it overlap or replace it?
Matthew: The shadow subschool barely scratches
the surface of what shadow magic can do. Shadow spells are only
partially real, and thus depend on belief for their full efficacy. A
few mysteries have a similar restriction, but all the others are wholly
real, transforming the environment, creatures, or the existence of
energies with material drawn directly from the Plane of Shadow.
Wizards: Is there relation between shadow magic and shadow weave from the Forgotten Realms, or the flying city of shadovar and the race of shades?
Matthew: The book does talk about this. In
essence, no. In shadow magic, the shadowcaster is a conduit to the
Plane of Shadow. The shadowcaster causes magic to happen by drawing
bits of the Plane of Shadow through that connection. The shadow weave
represents the negative space in the weave on Toril, using the flipside
of traditional magic and spells. Although the shadovar lived on the
Plane of Shadow, the two forms of magic are very different. Of course,
having lived on the Plane of Shadow, I'm certain many shadowvar employ
shadow magic and are probably the means of its introduction to the Forgotten Realms.
