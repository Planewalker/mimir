Planar Changelings: Though very rare, there are Planar descendents of doppelgangers and humans, but its one in a million whether someone has ever met one. The term changeling is more often applied to the children of fey, however, and most would assume the ability to shapeshift springs from faerie or planetouched blood. Regardless, those Eberron changelings who journey to the planes are at worst associated with tieflings, and can normally expect to be treated much like anyone else.
