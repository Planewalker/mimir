Pit fiends are among the most powerful of Baatezu, leading entire armies in the Blood War. They are often personal servants of the Lords of the Nine. They have spent countless generations tested by the intrigue and machinations of Baatific society, emerging as absolute masters of diabolic law.
The greatest number of pit fiends dwell in Nessus, the ninth of Baator's hells, although some exist in higher layers as well. The greatest of pit fiends are the Dark Eight.
Physically, pit fiends are corpulent, scaly humanoids of great size and strength, with bat wings, horns, monstrous claws, and venom-dripping fangs, though they have the ability to take on more comely guises with their powerful innate illusions.
