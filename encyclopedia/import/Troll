Trolls walk upright but hunched forward with sagging shoulders. Their gait is uneven, and when they run, their arms dangle and drag along the ground. For all this seeming awkwardness, trolls are very agile.
A typical adult troll stands 9 feet tall and weighs 500 pounds. Females are slightly larger than males. A trollâ€™s rubbery hide is moss green, mottled green and gray, or putrid gray. The hair is usually greenish black or iron gray.
Trolls speak Giant.
