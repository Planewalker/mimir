Lilith was consort to Moloch, but is currently consort to
Baalzebul. She is held in high regard by witches on the Material Plane.
She serves Baalzebul (and did during Moloch's reign as well, as did
Moloch himself), but her loyalty is not what it used to be; she feels
powerless in the current regime, and resents being moved here and there
at Baalzebul's request. Lilith is personally most attractive, and many devils
will do her small favors as a result. She appears as a beautiful,
curvaceous human female of giant (9' tall) stature, save her eyes are
glowing white and her skin is crimson. She has hooves, a serpent's
tail, and small curving horns. She rarely wears garments, instead
cloaking herself in darkness. She wields a barbed whip, and because of
this deep lash welts are commonly known in the hells as "Lilith's mark."
