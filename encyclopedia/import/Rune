Runes are an ancient form of writing.
A magic rune, like a glyph or a sigil, is a symbol of power. Runes are highly secret and hard to master. Even Odin suffered trying to learn the runes.

I know that I hung on a high windy tree for nine long nights;
I had a spear wound - that was my work - I struck myself...
They brought me no bread, no horn to drink from...
Crying aloud, I seized the runes; finally I fell...
Thus I learned the secret lore, prospered and waxed in wisdom...

In Ysgard, runes are used as spell+keys.
