The majority of planar elves live in Arvandor, located in the first layer of Arborea and home to the majority of the elven+pantheon. Its deep-woods appeal to the elves, many of whom never leave it. Perhaps due to the proximity to their gods, these elves are even more haughty and aloof than their prime counterparts, with a very strong tendency towards isolationism. Outcasts of elven society are often drawn to Fenmarel Mestarine’s realm Fennimar located in Limbo.
Drow are generally drawn to one of two places: good drow are attracted to Svartalfheim, located in Nidavellir, the third layer of Ysgard, while most evil drow are drawn to Lolth’s Realm in the Abyss, the Demonweb Pits. A few evil drow are found in Carceri, specifically in Vhaeraun’s realm, Ellaniath, in the layer Colothys.
Most planar elves feel strong ties to nature. Even if they plane on which they are living or visiting does not have a traditional environment, they will still respect the natural (or unnatural) order that is found on that plane. Many elves find employment as explorers and guides, especially in Arborea and in the Beastlands, as they are familiar with these types of environments.
