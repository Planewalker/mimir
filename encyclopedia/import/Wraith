Wraiths are evil undead spirits, eternally hungry for the energy of life. In some cases, the grim silhouette of a
wraith might appear armored or outfitted with weapons. This appearance
does not affect the creature’s AC or combat abilities but only reflects
the shape it had in life.
Baatezu sometimes create wraiths by transforming lemures. Dispater keeps them as slaves in his iron city.
