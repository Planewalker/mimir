Planetars are powerful Aasimon that directly serve the powers of the Upper Planes. They're tall - bigger than humans - angelic beings with smooth emerald skin, hairless heads, white feathered wings, and sharp blue eyes. Of the known aasimon, only solars outrank them. Planetars act as generals of great Celestial armies and aid the most powerful mortal servants of good.
Planetars may be any good alignment and are found throughout the Upper Planes.
