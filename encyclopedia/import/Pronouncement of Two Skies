In Gith's heart, fires raged. She lived in war, and in war, she *knew* herself. All that her eyes saw, she wanted to conquer.
Zerthimon
spoke the beginnings of that which was against Gith's will. He spoke
that the People already *knew* freedom. Now they should *know*
themselves again and mend the damage that had been done to the People.
Behind his words were many other hearts of the People who were weary of
the war against the illithids.
*Know*
that Gith's heart was not Zerthimon's heart on this matter. She said
that the war would continue. The *illithid* would be destroyed. Their
flesh would be no more. Then the People would claim the False Worlds as
their own. Gith told Zerthimon that they would be under the same sky in
this matter. The words were like bared steel.
From Zerthimon came the Pronouncement of Two Skies. In the wake of his words came war.
