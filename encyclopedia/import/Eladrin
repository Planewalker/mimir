Eladrins are the anthropomorphic personifications of chaotic good. They are native to the plane of Arborea. 
They travel the planes, opposing those who would harm the freedom and well-being of innocents. Like other Arboreans, they are extremely passionate creatures, with powerful and ever-shifting moods. Among mortals, they usually appear in disguise, as they believe that knowing their true nature would cause them to influence others in a way that might limit their freedom. They do not have a big influence on the Blood War, except to protect innocents from it.
Eladrins look to their queen, Morwel, for leadership and inspiration.
A note on plural forms
Although this is inconsistent in Planescape, "eladrins" is the plural form of eladrin in their original appearance in the Planescape Monstrous Compendium Appendix II and in all 3rd edition materials. Using "eladrin" as the plural is technically acceptable, as the Planewalker's Handbook does it, but should be frowned upon.
