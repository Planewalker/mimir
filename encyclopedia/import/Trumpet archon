Angels of resurrection and song, trumpet archons have the duty and privilege of escorting souls to and from Mount Celestia. Each trumpet archon carries a gleaming silver trumpet about 6 feet long.
A trumpet archon usually disdains physical combat, preferring to obliterate foes with spells quickly and return to its duties. If forced into an extended battle, it sounds its trumpet and attacks with a vengeance.
The trumpet archon caste is led by Israfil.
