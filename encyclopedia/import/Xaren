Cousins of the Xorn, xaren are slightly smaller with shinier, metallic hides. Where xorn feed on minerals and stone, xaren most love to devour magical metal. They demand it from creatures with dweomered weapons or armor, and attack if they're denied. They prefer iron, copper, silver, gold, and electrum, in that order, though they'll also eat metallic ore.
They're found on the planes of Elemental+Earth and Mineral.
