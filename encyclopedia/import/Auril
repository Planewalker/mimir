Auril, the Frostmaiden,&nbsp;is a lesser deity of cold and winter. She is neutral evil. She shares the realm of Winter's Hall in Pandemonium with the Norse god Loki. Auril's palace is formed from shaped wind walls that are bitterly cold, and her throne is made from frozen blue fire. Petitioners in her realm are spirits of cold, almost elemental in form.
She is subordinate to Talos, god of the dark side of nature.
