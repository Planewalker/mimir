An elemental compass is a small urn carved of stone and containing hollow pockets. It works only in the Ethereal Plane, an inner+plane, or the Prime Material Plane. 
To make the compass work, a representative sample of material from the plane sought must be placed in the urn and the lid sealed. To find the Elemental+Plane+of+Fire, a small burning fire must be placed in the urn. Once sealed, the fire will burn  until the lid is opened, just as water will not evaporate and air will not escape as long as the lid is  sealed. The urn glows yellow when the characters are heading in the direction of a portal, planar border, or vortex to the elemental plane they seek.
