Mercanes, or arcane, are twelve foot-tall, lanky, blue-skinned humanoids. They are traders and merchants who travel the planes in search of business, dealing in magic, gems, rare spices, fine wines, weapons, magic, and technology.
Mercanes appear sexless, and no one has ever seen a juvenile or aged one. It's said they have some great racial secret, that they have to be merchants because they require a rare spice to live, that they use magical items to reproduce, that there is really only one company of mercanes and they can be many places at once, that they've quarantined an entire world for some vast experiment... no one really knows for sure.
