Cuiraécen (koo-ray-eh-ken), a Power of storms and conflict in the Cerlian pantheon, is chaotic+good. His titles are the Stormlord, the God of Battle, and Haelyn’s Champion. His symbol is a lightning bolt crossed by a sword. Warriors preparing for battle may ask of Haelyn that they conduct themselves with honor, but is Cuiraécen’s name they most often invoke for victory. Cuiraécen serves his father as champion and herald. He is also allied with his mother Nesirie. His foes include both Belinik and Kriesha. He is caught in a romantic triangle between Laerme and Eloéle and acts for or against either of them as the situation demands. The god of battles is the patron of young warriors, for he is the representation of reckless courage and victory through strength. His worshipers may be of any non-lawful alignment. 
Cuiraécen's Realm in the first Layer of Ysgard is called Cuiraécen's Feasthall. Cuiraécen’s realm is a gigantic hall that sits atop of a steep sided hill, surrounded by storm clouds. Here great warriors celebrate their success in battle and forever recount the great events of their lives. The hall is home to a continuous feast where warriors may forever enjoy the spoils of the victory.
