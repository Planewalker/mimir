This huge mallet is eight feet long and weighs over 150 pounds. The maul will smash to flinders an oaken door up to 10 feet by 4 feet in one blow (two if the door is heavily bound with iron), drive piles of up to 2 feet in diameter into normal earth at 4 feet per blow, and it can be used as an impressive weapon.
Presumedly, these magic items were invented by titans.
