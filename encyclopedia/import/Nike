Nike is the goddess of victory among the Olympians, daughter of the Titans Styx and Pallas, and sister of Eris, goddess of discord. Some say she is the sister of Tyche as well, and was instrumental in driving her from the Pantheon. She manifests as a tall woman with wings, but can change shape at will. She often rides with Athena and Ares when they go into battle.
Unusually stubborn, Nike has a very stern way of looking at things and her clerics are not allowed to transgress against their alignments or sect even once. She is also somewhat shallow, thinking only in terms of conflict and ultimate triumph. She does not approve of subterfuge.
She has no Realm of her own, maintaining homes in the realms of both Athena and Ares instead.
