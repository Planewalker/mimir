Zerths are the closest thing to priests the godless Githzerai have. They are mystical teachers who pass on the philosophy of Zerthimon, the ancient leader who founded the githzerai race by defying Gith the Liberator. They teach that though Zerthimon died in the last battle with Gith, one day he will return. The githzerai+Wizard-King does not approve of the zerths, who divide the githzerai people by giving them a spiritual role model other than him, but they are too much an ingrained part of githzerai culture to destroy.
Zerths combine magical or psionic ability with fighting prowess, as presumably Zerthimon did as well.
