The Norse demigod of blacksmiths appears as a man so stocky and massive of build that many believe him to be a large dwarf. He is the patron of all smiths, and as such spends most of his time forging weapons or blessing the works of his followers. 
Volundr is worshiped by both humans and dwarves. He is lawful good, but his Realm is somewhere in Ysgard.
