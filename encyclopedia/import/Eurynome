Originally, Eurynome was a Titan. While her brethren battled the gods, she spent her time on the then-unformed Material+Plane. When the other titans found her, they killed her for not helping them in their fight. Her body became the first continent, but her soul was not wanted by any god, and Eurynome became a Vestige.
Now, though Pact magic, she can grant power over the land, sea, and air, as well as bestow some of her titan powers (Through a magical maul summoned at will).
