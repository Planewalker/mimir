Dolora is a prostitute of the mind at the Brothel of Slaking Intellectual Lusts, run by Fall-From-Grace. She specializes in logic, games of strategy, and debate.
She is a dark-haired, pale woman with unusual eyes the color of brushed steel. She speaks in a voice that had a far-away quality as if it is somehow not attached to her. Quite possibly, she is some sort of lawful Planetouched, like a Mechanatrix. Her first love, Merriman, literally holds the keys to her heart.
