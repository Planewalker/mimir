Wastequake is a very powerful arcane spell that creates a powerful seismic event when cast in the Gray Waste, the only Plane on which the spell works. When cast, the ground opens up and the ground begins to buck and heave. The spell does not work on fixed structures, but does on transitory shelters such as tents.
