The Ghetto is a sanctuary in Arcadia (on the first layer, Abellio) where a body can relax from the prying eyes of Petitioner and Einheriar patrols, from Harmonium and their constant attempts to force people into their mold. 
Ghetto's nestled in a secluded valley, surrounded by a dense wood. It's supposed to be a spin-off of Meriadar's realm. Most of its inhabitants are good-aligned, but few are human and most are nocturnal. It's mostly a collection of tents around a central marketplace, but it holds a population of 5000.
