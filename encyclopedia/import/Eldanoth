A former servant of Orcus, Eldanoth ("The Bloodless Scion") left after his patron's death at the hands of Kiaransalee, taking over the 359th layer of the Abyss, called the Arc of Eternity. He seeks to become a power of crime and hatred, and his worship includes the slaughter of criminals by criminals. He has become something of a folk hero in Thanatos, where his agents work to sabotage Orcus's plans.
Eldanoth looks like a smiling tiefling with snakes for fingers.
