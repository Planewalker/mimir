Savitri is the Vedic Power of the day long sun. He causes all things to move and work, the tides to ebb and flow. Like his complement Surya, he sees all that occurs under the sunâ€™s light. Unlike Surya, however, he is not always a gentle god; what he sees sometimes angers him and causes him to shine down with unmerciful intensity, or to hide his glorious face from the world. He has the power to bestow life upon any inanimate object (including a dead body), to drive away rot and decay, and to move any object at will. In his true form, Savitri is a man with golden eyes, hands, and tongue. He is seen every day riding his golden chariot across the sky.
Savitri is generally a beneficent god, but he has a bad temper and is quick to punish transgressions with oppressive heat. Like Surya, he despises thieves, murderers, and others who conduct their business in the shelter of the night, and will never aid such a character - even if it means leaving more worthy individuals to their fates. When one of his worshipers dies, there is a small chance that Savitri will restore the dead individual to life. 
His Realm, the Domain of the Day-Long Sun can be found in Amoria, Elysium's first Layer. A portal there leads to the city of Pashrita in Mitra's realm of Goldfire.
