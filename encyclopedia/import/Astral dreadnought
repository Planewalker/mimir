Astral dreadnoughts are serpentine creatures the size of storm giants, each with two gigantic pincers, a reddish armored carapace, and a single cyclopean eye. Their tails are endless, tapering into silver+cords which stretch off forever into the void of the Astral Plane. 
The creatures seem to act as guardians of the Astral Plane. They have never been seen anywhere else.
