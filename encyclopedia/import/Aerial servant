The so-called aerial servants (they call themselves haoou in their own language) are a form of Elemental creature native to the plane+of+Elemental+Air. Normally invisible, they resemble eight foot tall legless humanoids of sparkling blue smoke with empty eyes, a slash for a mouth, and long, four-fingered hands. 
They reproduce by allowing storms to blow them in two. They are enemies of the helions and the Djinn.
