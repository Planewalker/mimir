One of many Japanese rain gods, sometimes Kura Okami can get caught up in Susanoo's fury and send too much rain. He can also be forgetful, sending no rain at all for many weeks. Most of the time, however, he is both kind and efficient. During the winter, he may send snow.
Kura Okami is a translucent old man with a kindly, if somewhat vacant, expression. He lives in the Beastlands, in the Layer of Karasuthra, in a realm called the Misty Valley. He is an intermediate deity. His alignment is chaotic good.
Other rain gods in the Japanese Pantheon include Taka Okami, who dwells in the mountains, and Taki-Tsu Hiko, Prince Cataract, who is a deified rock.
