Sollux[/b] are cousins of the efreet who have taken to dwelling in lava tunnels in the Prime+Material. They have a military order called the Brotherhood of the Sun, which opposes the efreet and all their works. Brothers of the Sun wear red-gold plate mail and carry glowing shields.
Sollux are tall and statuesque, and have crimson skin and bright yellow hair. Their irises are fiery white or fiery blue, while the "whites" of their eyes are glowing yellow-orange.
