Alocer is a baatezu+noble in the service of Dispater, leading 36 companies of Erinyes into battle. He wears plate mail and fights with broadsword, axe, mace, and dagger.
Alocer has a humanoid body with red-gold flesh and a fearsome leonine head, something like a fiendish Leonal in appearance. The fiery flash of his eyes can be seen from some distance, and he can use this trait to blind his opponents.
