Rao is a greater god of reason, peace, and serenity worshiped by the people of Oerth, particularly in the nation of Veluna. He is a god of Mount Celestia, where his realm Sweet Reason lies on the Layer of Mercuria.
An artifact associated with this god, the Crook of Rao, was used by Canon Hazen of Veluna to drive away all Tanar'ri from the Realm of the Cambion demigod Iuz, banishing vast hordes of them back to the+Abyss. How permanent this banishment is has yet to be seen.
