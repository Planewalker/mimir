A hordling (HORD-ling) is a twisted fiend of the Gray Waste. Hordlings evolve from Larvae into all manner of obscene and baroque shapes. They may have wings, tentacles, and any number of eyes or limbs. Somehow the sin within them is great enough to fester and flourish despite - or even because of - the Waste's ennui and despair.
