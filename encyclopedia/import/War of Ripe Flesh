The War of Ripe Flesh was fought by the first of the Succubus race, born from pure lust in the early days of the Tanar'ri species. The most powerful of the primal succubi fought one another for supremacy, directing countless enthralled minions against one another until only a few extremely powerful ones, more deadly and beautiful than ever, remained, each settling in far-flung corners of the Abyss.
The names of most have been lost, but these primal survivors are known to have included Malcanthet, Shami-Amourae, Lynkhab, and Xinivrae.
