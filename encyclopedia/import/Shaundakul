Shaundakul, the Rider of the Winds, is a Power of Toril. His Realm, Shaunidaur, is in Ysgard. He has no great hall, but wanders the realm and the planes. Currently, he is romantically linked to Aerdrie Faenya.
Shaundakul is a lesser god of caravans, exploration, long-range traders, miners, portals, travel, and windghosts, and can thus be considered a planewalker's  deity. He is chaotic neutral.
