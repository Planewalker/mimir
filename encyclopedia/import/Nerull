Nerull (NEH-rull) is a god of death, darkness, murder, the underworld, and winter worshipped primarily on Oerth. 
Nerull dwells in Carceri, either in its outermost layer or its innermost. His Realm there is Necromanteion. Unlike most inhabitants of the Red Prison, Nerull wasn't banished to Carceri - he lives there because he likes it.
