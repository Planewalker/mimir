The Great Spirit, also called Father the Sky, Great Mystery, Wakonda, Tirawa, Arch of Heaven, and the Kitcki Manitou, is the master of light and the breath of life. He dwells within the Upper World, a Demiplane with connections to the Beastlands. His primary form is that of a disk of white light more brilliant than the sun, though he can assume the form of any animal found in nature (the animal appears to be made of light). The Great Spirit is lawful good.
