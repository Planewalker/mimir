Color pools are like holes in the fabric of the Astral Plane. They show through to planes that the Astral touches such as Baator, Arborea, or the Prime+Material.
As with any other type of movement on the Astral, one just has to think of going to the place that she desires, and after a certain period of time, she'll wind up at that pool. 
Apparently there's a color code that can define where a cutter is heading off to, but no one's been able to prove it.
