The ravid is a creature native to the Positive+Energy+Plane. A ravid resembles a 6-foot-long serpent with no mouth and a single, spindly arm, glowing brightly with a golden light. Common on their home plane, ravids're very rare elsewhere.
A ravid is creation incarnate, glowing with so much light that it animates inanimate objects nearby.
