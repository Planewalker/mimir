Ethereal dopplegangers live on the Ethereal Plane, in buildings that serve as combination showrooms, vaults, prisons, and shops. Ethereal dopplegangers are fond of magic items, and frequently visit the Material+Plane to acquire new ones for their collection.
In their natural form, they're gangly humanoids with slick skin and white, pupiless eyes. While traveling, they usually take the form of an attractive member of another race.
