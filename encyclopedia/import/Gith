Gith was the warrior/psionicist who liberated the Githyanki forerunners from Illithid slavery. After the wars ended, she attempted to make an alliance between her people and the slaadi, but was turned down or ignored. Next she journeyed to Tiamat's layer and made a pact with the red dragons, which has been honored in all the thousands of centuries since that day. Gith herself never returned.
The giths are also a githyanki-descended race of bestial, animalistic creatures native to the world of Athas.
