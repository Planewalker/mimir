At the point where all three Layers of the Gray Waste touch is the Town at the Center, a mixture of brutality, sophistication, and apathy. 
The ruler of the town is Dandy Will, a yugoloth-blooded half-fiend or tiefling. He, like the town, seem to have some power to resist the Waste's apathy - not completely, but they're livelier than the bashers in Death of Innocence.
The Town at the Center is divided into three sections, corresponding to the three glooms of the Waste.
