The River Oceanus is a Planar Path. The greatest river in the Upper Planes, the heavenly counterpart to the dark and polluted Styx, the River Oceanus begins in the fourth Layer of Elysium, Thalasia, winds through Belieren, Eronia, Amoria, the three layers of the Beastlands, the layer of Olympus in Arborea before finally terminating in Ossa, Arborea's second layer. It also flows into the Gates of the Moon during high tide.
The Oceanus is populated by songsharks, Asrai, balaenas, and mundane and celestial aquatic beings of all sorts. Its waters are fresh and potable throughout its length, although in places a traveler will encounter dangerous rapids and waterfalls - while its inhabitants do not begrudge honest travelers, the river wasn't created with them in mind.
Oceanus is also a Titan imprisoned in Carceri by the Olympian gods.
