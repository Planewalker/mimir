Known as the Dreaming Duke, Haures was the tyranical lord of an unknown land obsessed with constantly adding onto his castle.  When at last he died, his subjects stormed the structure, hoping to loot the fantastic goods it was said to contain.  Unfortunately, the castle was completely empty.
Those knowledgeable about Pact magic believe Haures was actually a Rakshasa and that the contents and majority of his castle's construction were shifted to the Ethereal Plane.  After he died, Haures lived on as a ghost, relying on his illusion abilities to continue the lavish lifestyle he enjoyed when alive.  In time, the rakshasa lost the ability to distinguish between his illusions and his true existence on the Ethereal Plane, and he became a Vestige.
