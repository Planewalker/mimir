Tuoni is a Finnish greater Power of the underworld, the husband of Tuonetar and the father of Loviatar. He is dressed in dark furs, but constantly changes form. He is less evil than his wife, and his clerics go about the battlefield to aid those near death to the land of the dead (though some are overenthusiastic in this task). He appears in visions when Finnish heroes are resurrected. On rare occasions, it is said, Tuoni will leave his domain to personally take a particularly desired hero back to the grave.
Tuoni and Tuonetar's Realm, Tuonela, is found on Pandesmos, the second Layer of Pandemonium. It is a place of gray mists and shrieking winds, even more joyless and bleak than the rest of the Plane.
