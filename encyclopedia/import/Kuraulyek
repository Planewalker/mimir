Kuraulyek is the patron deity of urds, a race of winged kobolds. In mythology, he was a servant of Kurtulmak who stole a pair of magical wings the more powerful kobold god had captured from Syranita; Kuraulyek then flew away and created the urds as rivals to the kobolds.
Kuraulyek, who is only a demigod in status, is terrified that Kurtulmak will come to extract revenge.  His Realm in Oinos, a gloomy cave, is called Urdsrest. He has a force of monstrous bats that defend his layer, and shuns contact with all other deities and inhabitants of the Gray Waste.
