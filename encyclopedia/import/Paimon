Paimon was once a mortal dancer and lothario of great ability and charisma. When he gained the love of a woman that another noble desired, that noble had him captured and his limbs replaced by blades. When he returned to the ballroom and stubbornly continued to dance, the scream of his former lover transformed him into a Vestige.
