Nut is the Power of the sky in the Egyptian Pantheon. She is both wife and sister to Geb, the earth power. The two are deeply in love and will never act in a manner that is harmful to the other. Because Ra had forbidden Nut and Geb to have children, she was forced to resort to trickery to bear her four young. Since Ra had decreed that Nut could not give birth on any day of any month of any year, she went to Thoth for help. Thoth managed to capture some of the moon’s light and used it to create four new days (outside of Ra’s domain).

Thoth managed to capture some of the moon’s light and used it to create four new days (outside of Ra’s domain). On each of these days, Nut gave birth to a new god. They are Set, Osiris, Isis and Nephythys.
In her true form, Nut appears as a tall, slender woman whose body is the black of the night sky. She sparkles with starlight and is enchanting to behold. Omens from Nut always take the form of patterns in the stars. 
Nut's Realm, The Refuge of Night, can be found on Elysium's third Layer, Belierin.
