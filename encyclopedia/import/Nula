Nula is the Guardian of Animals in the pantheon of Maztica. She normally manifests as a wise, long-limbed monkey, though she can become any animal she desires.
Nula is a chaotic neutral deity, a creature of wild emotional extremes through which she passes with sudden, sometimes violent, suddenness. In her various aspects, she is Goddess of Monkeys, Goddess of Cats, Goddess of Carrion-Eaters, Goddess of Fish, Goddess of Birds, Goddess of Monsters, Goddess of Jaguars, Goddess of Hummingbirds, Goddess of Snakes, Goddess of Vultures, Goddess of Parrots, Goddess of Eagles, Goddess of Dolphins, and Goddess of Fire Lizards.
Nula dwells in Tuchitl, on the first layer of Ysgard. Her (relatively small) Realm is filled with animals of all sorts.
