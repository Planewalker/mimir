Aram Oakwright is a dwarven fighter and the current Factol of the Fated.
During the Rowan+Darkwood administration, Aram Oakwright was considered the Duke's right hand man, but as a distant relative of Darkwood's predecessor, Emma Oakwright, Aram felt he had been cheated of his rightful position. Throughout Darkwood's reign he secretly spread malicious gossip about the factol and his dealings, though this had no visible effect.
Since Darkwood disappeared during the Faction War, Aram has the rank he so coveted, and has moved his faction to Ysgard, claiming to be directing the Fated in a kindler, gentler direction based less on taking and more on rightfully earning. Given Aram's chaotic neutral alignment this is dubious, but it makes for good press.
It's not known if Aram retains anything of Emma Oakwright's alliance with Timmon d'Arlen.
