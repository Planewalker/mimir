An alu-fiend (AL-oo-feend), or alu-demon, is the female offspring of a Succubus Tanar'ri and a mortal male. They are often very attractive with some of the features of their fiendish heritage, such as small wings or a tail. They are generally evil.
They may be thought of as the female equivalent to a Cambion.
For gameplay, one could use the Half-Demon template.
