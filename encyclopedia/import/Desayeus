Known as the God Who Was Banned, Desayeus was a deity who took as part of his Portfolio the realm of the yet unborn.
The problem is that there was an edict, supposedly as old as the Multiverse itself, that prohibits deities from influencing preincarnate souls in any way. It has something to do with free will, so that new souls are born without any inherent bias toward any deity (although they can certainly get cultural biases as they grow older). 
Because of the Ban, Desayeus was stripped of his power only seven hours after he expanded his portfolio. As a further punishment, Desayeus was imprisoned in Agathion, the fourth Layer of Pandemonium by a conclave of other gods. The Ban is taken very, very seriously, in part because the gods feared the Ban would strip them of their own power if they failed to punish Desayeus.
Desayeus' prison is guarded by Eco, a silver-skinned Solar, and Bramman, a Planetar.
Because many of his servants were paladins, it can be inferred that Desayeus was lawful or neutral good.
