Titania is the Queen of the Seelie Faerie Court, which wanders the planes of Chaos and Good at random. She is a flighty, fey creature, an ally of the Seldarine and worshipped by good and neutral-aligned fey of all kinds. 
Her sister, the Queen of Air and Darkness, was corrupted by a gem containing an ancient, evil force. Titania is connected somehow with the hag goddess Cegilune, her sister or other self. Her husband is Oberon, the Lord of Beasts.
