Ansitif, the Befouler, once is a fallen Tanar'ri lord once known for corrupting places of worship. He joined with six tanar'ri allies long ago to hunt down and destroy a powerful Obyrith called the Malgoth. Their victory left them vulnerable in their centers of power, and opportunitistic demon lords assassinated or imprisoned each member of the alliance in turn. Although largely forgotten, Ansitif remembers fallen Abyssal empires and secret magical locations and is now imprisoned in the Wells of Darkness.
