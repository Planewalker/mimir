Nightshades are powerful creatures from the Negative+Energy+Plane who seek to spread death and destruction everywhere. They are also found on the Ethereal Plane and the Plane+of+Shadow.
Some sages suggest that when numerous undead beings are destroyed, the energies released on the Negative Energy Plane coalesce to form a nightshade. Others speculate that they are related to umbral+blots, or that umbral blots are some sort of larval and metamorphosed form of the species. Still others say that they are the spirits of powerful outsiders who have somehow transformed into undead due to constant exposure of negative energies. 

Nightcrawlers are vast worms, 100 feet long, jet black in color.


Nightwalkers are 20-foot-tall, jet black giant humanoids. They can curse with their gaze.


Nightwings are giant, jet black bats with 50-foot wingspans.


Nighthaunts are the smallest and weakest of nightshades, looking like gargoyles with blank faces sculpted from the purest night.
