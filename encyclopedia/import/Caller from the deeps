The ocean is deep. Very, very deep. There are some places that are deeper than the tallest mountain is high. And these black places are hungry -- they eat everything that falls into them: corpses, ships... even light. But sometimes the blackness gets greedy and gluttonous. Impatient. And it doesn't want to wait for these things to fall down into its maw. When that happens, the abysses come hunting.
