Largest of the gem+dragons, moonstone dragons are rarely seen outside the realms of Faerie or the Region of Dreams. Their scales shimmer with a pale silver hinting of blue in the moonlight. They speak their own language as well as Sylvan. In dreams they speak the language of the dreamer.
Moonstone dragons spend most of their time in the Ethereal Plane, or perhaps they live on the moon. They are somehow connected with the hosts of Faerie. They feed on moonbeams and faerie nectar.
