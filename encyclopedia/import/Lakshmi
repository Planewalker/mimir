The goddess of fortune and beauty in the Indian Pantheon, Lakshmi is the wife of Vishnu. She appears as a golden-skinned woman sitting in a giant floating lotus.
Lakshmi dwells with her husband in Mount Celestia, in a realm called the Divine Lotus. Her domain is said to be a great step-temple that is overgrown with lotus flowers that are always in bloom.
