A tridrone appears as a three-sided pyramid with three spiderlike legs. Each of its three “faces” has a single eye, a mouth, and one arm, all set vertically along the center.
Tridrones speak the Modron language and the Trade Tongue of the planes. They accept orders from quadrones and can give instructions to duodrones. Tridrones are capable of reporting actions and observations, as well as actually planning limited objectives on the battlefield.
