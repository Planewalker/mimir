Sharindlar the Merciful is the dwarven goddess of healing and mercy. Dwarves wounded in battle often call out her name. Kept secret from nondwarves is her role as patroness of romantic love, courtship, and fertility. She appears as a slim, spirited, full-bearded and flame-haired dwarf maiden. Some myths say she is the mother of Shiallia, the offspring of a brief dalliance with Tapann.
Her Realm in Nidavellir is called the Merciful Court, a circle of standing stones where nightly dances are held in her honor.
