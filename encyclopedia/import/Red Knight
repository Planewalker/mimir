Red Knight is a demipower known to the world of Toril. Her portfolio includes planning, strategy, and tactics. She is lawful neutral.
She has built a permanent fortress called the Red Tower in Knight's Rest (or Warrior's Rest), the Realm of Tempus in Limbo. It is one of the few stable and permanent features on the plane, and the terrain within a one mile radius of it cannot be altered by anyone other than Tempus or Red Knight.
