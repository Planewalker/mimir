Ely Cromlich was the Cambion in charge of weapon production, storage, and sale at the Armory prior to the Faction War. Rumored to be a close friend or lover of then-Factol Pentar, he also oversaw many of the day-to-day affairs of the Armory due to the Factol's preoccupation with the Great Modron March. He played a key role in the Faction War by assuming control of the Armory after the disappearance of Pentar, allegedly at the hands of the Harmonium. In retaliation, he freely distributed the faction's weapons to enemies of the Harmonium and brought a Tanar'ri war brigade rampaging into Sigil during the battle in the Lower Ward. His whereabouts are unknown since that battle.
