Zuggtmoy, or Tsuggtmoy as her name is also spelled, is the Tanar'ri Queen of Fungi. She shares the Abyssal Layer of Shedaklah with Juiblex, her "cousin" and rival. Juiblex has gained much territory while Zuggtomoy was imprisoned beneath the Temple of Elemental Evil on Oerth. 
Zuggtmoy is served by violet fungi, phantom fungi, basidirons, phycomids, myconids, Rukarazylls, and vathagu. Physically, the queen looks like an attractive human woman made of fungus and slime with four antlerlike horns and a lower torso that is a coiling pillar of fungous tendrils. She and Iuz are lovers.
