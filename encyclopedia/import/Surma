Surma is the Finnish demigod of death. He continuously travels the orbs of Carceri, where he was banished by Ukko, challenging all he meets to combat. He often appears as a slightly aging warrior in leather buckskins and red boots.
He is most often found in swampy, gloomy places, accompanied by undead.
