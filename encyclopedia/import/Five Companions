The legendary Five Companions of the Guardinal race have served as exemplars and epitomes of their respective kinds for as long as there have been guardinals - probably as long as there's been a plane of Elysium. In contrast to the relatively unchanging ranks of the Hebdomad, Lords of the Nine, yugoloth+lords and so forth, members of the Companions come and go, assuming the office when they are fit for it and willingly retiring when someone else is more fit. 

Talisid, the Celestial Lion, has held that position longer than anyone else, and few can remember the name of his predecessor.
Duke Lacan was the representative of the lupinals until recently, when he was succeeded by Talisid's close friend Kharash.
Duchess Callisto was the sagely representative of the ursinals, but was recently succeeded by Bharrai, the stately Mother Bear.
Duke Windheir was the greatest of the avorals, but he is now enjoying his well-earned rest while Sathia, the Sky Duchess, has taken over.
Lord Hwhyn of the equinals has been succeeded by Vhara, Duchess of the Fields.
The curmudgeonly Lord Rhanok retired the most recently, passing his position on to Manath, the Horned Duke.
