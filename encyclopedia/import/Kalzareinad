Kalzareinad, the Keeper of Dark Wonders, was a neutral evil demipower of the Gray Waste. His portfolio was dragon magic, specifically the uncaring, evil, or selfish application of dragon magic. His symbol was a five-pointed star encircled by a dragon grabbing its own tail in its mouth. His worship and portfolio were entirely subsumed by Kereska during the Time of Troubles (1358 DR), and he passed quietly into deific death shortly thereafter in the Astral Plane.
