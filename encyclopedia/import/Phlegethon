Phlegethon is the third Layer of Pandemonium. The unrelenting noise of dripping water meshes with the howling winds of Phlegethon's narrow, twisting tunnels. The rock itself absorbs light and heat. All light sources, natural and magic, only shine to half their normal distance. Unlike on the other layers of Pandemonium, normal gravity applies in Phlegethon's tunnels, giving rise to intricate stalagmite and stalactite formations, which in turn are constantly weathered by the brutal wind.
Phlegethon contains the city of Windglum and the realms of Erythnul, Zeboim, Diirinka, and the Queen of Air and Darkness. 
A fat, bloblike creature called the Ingress Mother forms
a living portal from Phlegethon to the next layer, Agathion. Its
children, the Ingress, will direct their Mother to take travelers where
they want to go in exchange for food, shoving both food and travelers
into the Mother's hungry maw.
