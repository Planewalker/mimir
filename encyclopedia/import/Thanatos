Thanatos, a frigid tundra with thin air and deserts of bone meal, is the Realm of Orcus on the Abyss.  It was briefly (for a some centuries) held by the drow goddess Kiaransalee, but reclaimed by Orcus after the events of The Great Modron March and Dead Gods.
Its capital was Naratyr, but Orcus has since moved the capital to the city of Orcusgate.
