Exemplar is a fan-created word for outer planar beings of the outsider creature type. It refers specifically to those creatures who personify one of the nine alignments (slaadi, Tanar'ri, yugoloths, Baatezu, modrons, Archons, guardinals, Eladrins, and Rilmani).
The word was created on the Planewalker.com message boards back when they were hosted by rpgconsortium. The only incidence of possible official use is from the 3.0 version of the Monster Manual, which said, "Death slaadi represent a corruption of pure chaos by evil rather than true exemplars of it." 
The Mimir called these beings planeborne.
