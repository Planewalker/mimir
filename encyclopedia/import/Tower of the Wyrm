Adjacent to the Prison and standing within Petitioners’ Square rises the Tower of the Wyrm, a relic of Sigil’s past now serving as the headquarters of the Sodkillers and emblazoned on all sides still with the crimson dragon symbol of the Red Death. Prior to the Faction War, the Tower was an extension of the Prison, housing petty criminals, and, during the reign of Alisohn Nilesia saw quite a few executions. It also housed the Cage Serpent, the Tower's eponymous Wyrm.
