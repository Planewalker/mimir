Brigit, daughter of the Daghdha, is a lesser goddess of fire, poetry, healing, and smithwork in the Celtic Pantheon, appearing as a tall woman with hair the color of flame. She loves to hear poetry sung on the battlefield, and becomes surrounded with flame when she fights.
She dwells with most of the other Celtic powers in Tir na Og in the Outlands. She is likely the same being as Belisarma.
