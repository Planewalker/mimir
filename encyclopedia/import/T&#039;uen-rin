T'uen-rin are (probably) the females of the ki-rin species, more intelligent and noble than the males. They're normally found in the skies and on the plains of Arcadia.
Like ki-rin, their bodies are horselike, but their coats are covered with fine golden scales, and a single horn grows from their heads. Flowers spring up when their hooves touch the earth.
