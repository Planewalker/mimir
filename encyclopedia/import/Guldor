Guldor is a world on the Prime Material Plane, conquered several decades ago by the demon queen Lolth. Its primary god of evil, Abrogard, was slain by Lolth, who is in the process of assuming his aspect.
Guldor is filled with mountains that seem unnaturally pointed and tall, like titanic stalagmites upthrusting from the earth. Its sky is bluish-purple and overcast, and the stars are so large and heavy they seem almost like moons.
This world is also likely the location of the dwarven empire of Truegard, enslaved by driders in the service of Lolth and accessible from Lolth's Demonweb.
Kiaransalee, driven from Thanatos by Orcus, has taken the fortress of Kandelspire on Guldor's dwarven kingdom of Maldev as her new center of operations.
