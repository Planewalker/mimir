Wenta, the youngest of the three daughters of Procan, is a goddess of Autumn, brewing, harvest, and the West Wind known to the world of Oerth. She is called the Alewife and the Harvest Daughter. She dislikes her brother Telchur.
Wenta is a free spirit, travelling where the wind takes her, but can currently be found in Arvandor, drinking beer with the Seldarine. Like most of them, she is Chaotic Good.
