St. Cuthbert of the Cudgel is a Power of common sense, wisdom, zeal, honesty, truth and discipline who is primarily worshipped on the Prime world of Oerth, although he has followers on the planes, especially in Arcadia and among the Harmonium Faction, whose Factol, Faith, is a High Priestess of the Cudgel.
 He is often thought of as a power of the common man, pragmatic and impatient with ostentatious displays, frivolous pursuits, or idle talk. His worshippers are evenly divided between lawful good types and lawful neutral types, and St. Cuthbert himself is either lawful good with lawful neutral tendencies or lawful neutral with lawful good tendencies (depending on your perspective). He's a stern power who encourages his faithful to bash stupid, chaotic, morally weak or lazy folk on the head (probably one of the reasons the Harmonium are known as Hardheads, and definitely the reason one of the symbols of St. Cuthbert is a crumpled hat). He does not tolerate evil or chaos of any kind, but he is more interested in promoting law and order, converting the uninformed, and dealing with heretics among his faithful.
His Realm is the Basilica of Saint Cuthbert (also called the Bastion of Law) in Abellio, the first Layer of Arcadia. He has a feud with Oerth's other highly lawful power, Pholtus.
