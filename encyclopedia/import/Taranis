Taranis was a Celtic deity of the weather whose name means "thunderer." As such, the Roman writers equated him with Jupiter (the Greek Zeus), although his position in Celtic religion was not as prominent as that of Jupiter in the Roman pantheon. Taranis's emblem is a wheel, and he is often portrayed on horseback, crushing a monster of some sort. He seems closer to the Norse Thor than the Roman Jupiter.
