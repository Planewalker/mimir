Alkiliths are a type of (true) Tanar'ri that take the form of amorphous blobs of slime or ooze. Alkiliths typically serve as spies and assassins, using their plastic, always changing form to allow themselves to evade detection till it is far too late for a chosen victim.
Alkiliths are often found in the service of the Abyssal Lord Juiblex, but they may serve any other Abyssal Lord's ranks as well.
