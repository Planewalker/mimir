Myrkul was once a neutral evil greater deity known to the world of Toril. His portfolio included autumn, corruption, decay, death, dusk, exhaustion, old age, parasites, wasting, and the dead - he got virtually all of these from Jergal, who gave them to him willingly after a game of knucklebones.
After Myrkul died in the Time of Troubles, his responsibilities were assumed by Cyric; later, they were taken from Cyric by Kelemvor, who has them now.
His realm in Oinos in the Gray Waste was called the Bone Castle. Under the reign of Kelemvor, it is now called the Crystal Tower. It is surrounded by a wall of Petitioners, made from those who worshiped no god in life.
