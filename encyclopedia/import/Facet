A facet is a humanoid drawn of angular lines and composed of salt crystals. These natives of the Quasielemental+Plane+of+Salt are at war against the Elemental Plane of Water. About a third of all facets inch forward at the border to the Plane of Water in an attempt to eradicate all moisture. Some seem to think that there is a master facet controlling all others, but this is as yet unproven. Some calculated that the facet population doubles every 3 weeks. 
Facets do not seem to communicate in any way, thus some have  considered them to be one single organism with detachable parts working in synch with a collective consciousness.
Facets reproduce when they touch water. Eventually they hope to eliminate the Plane of Water altogether.
