Eleador was a young priest who was thrust into circumstances far beyond his control, where he and a small band of adventurers were the only ones who could prevent the unleashing of a monstrous evil. Overcoming unbelievable odds, he managed to thwart the evil, and several deities gratefully rewarded him with sainthood.
Eleadorâ€™s greatest power is his gift of timesight. When Eleador sleeps, he is able to gaze into the past and the future in his dreams. The source of this power is not psionic; it has been speculated by some sages that a link exists between St. Eleador and the Demiplane+of+Time. It is possible that because of this link the gods have taken a great interest in his affairs, which resulted in his elevation to the sainthood at a comparatively low level of experience and with a relatively weak reputation.
Eleador often wanders from Plane to plane, but rarely uses disguises. He appears to be a man of about 30 years of age, with blond hair and blue eyes; he wears deep blue robes over his chain mail with the insignia of a golden chimera on his chest.
