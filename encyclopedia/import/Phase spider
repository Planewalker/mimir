Phase spiders are aggressive predators that can move quickly from the Ethereal Plane to attack opponents on the Material+Plane. Some phase spiders live mostly on the Material Plane, but these spiders are the exception, not the rule. Most phase spiders dwell in clutches, or tribes, based on webs of solid+ether. Each clutch claims various Prime territories as its sole hunting ground. Sometimes different clutches cooperate, but often they come into conflict.
A typical phase spiderâ€™s body is 8 feet long. It weighs about 700 pounds. Sometimes they are depicted as having humanoid heads. Phase spider webs are typically made from quintessential+ether; the ability to spin webs of solid ether is rare. Solid ethereal spider silk is a valuable trade item throughout the planes, and it is used in the manufacture of portable+holes.
Planar+spiders are more intelligent relatives of phase spiders with the ability to travel to the Astral Plane as well. Vortex+spiders are phase spiders who have adapted to the conditions of the Demiplane+of+Time.
