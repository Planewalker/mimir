Most people know the name Emirikol the Chaotic, though he dropped from public view at least 30 years ago at the height of an arcane struggle that took place over a spit of land called Point Harrow, on the Prime Material Plane. The spot is cut off from the world by a magical conflagration created during the battle, which was between Emirikol and a mighty wizard called Tinnestron. Remaining to this day, the region is b uffeted by powerful magnetic winds that carry shards of iron and steel (it is hypothesized that the metal comes from the Quasielemental+Plane+of+Mineral), which exist both in the Material Plane and the Ethereal Plane. Within the calm eye of the storm, Emirikol dwells in a tall spire of crystal. Nearby are pathetic, formally-human creatures called the Magic-Starved, as well as mutant horses called the Steeds of Chaos. He is served by iron golems.
