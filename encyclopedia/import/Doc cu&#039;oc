A doc cu'oc is a spirit guardian that works for the Celestial Bureaucracy, resembling humans who have been split in half from the top of their head downwards, so they have only one eye, one arm, and one leg. 
Doc cu'ocs have permanent lairs on the Astral Plane, which they must visit periodically to refresh themselves with astral energies. If their lairs are robbed, they destroy the Prime+Material region under their care in a fit of rage.
