The insidious tsochari are natives of a cold, horrific Prime+Material world where the sun is no more than a distant speck in the sky, but they have used Portals to travel to many other worlds and planes, infiltrating the bodies and minds of powerful mages in the name of their alien god, Mak Thuum Ngatha. 
In their true forms tsochari are tangled masses of slimy, ropelike tendrils, but they can inhabit the bodies of others and pass unnoticed in their societies.
