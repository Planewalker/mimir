Entropes are Doomguard creations, meant to speed up the collapse of borders of the Elemental Planes. The creature has a wormlike body, with multiple pairs of legs, and a head bearing multiple eyes and mouths. In combat, they create breaches in the Elemental plane they reside on (They can literally eat their way through Inner Planar boundaries, and are immune to all elemental effects), which then create small explosions. The Entropes hate all things, and has only so far developed antagonistic relations with everything, especially the Menglis.
