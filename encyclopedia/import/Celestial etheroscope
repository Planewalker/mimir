This nonmagical device is a complex set of brass-bound lenses, tubes, and glass vials filled with colored liquid. By looking at the light reflected through the lenses and colored liquids, a proficient user can discern the tides of fate on various planes of existence. The device costs 1000 gp and weights 50 pounds.
It's similar to a nonmagical version of a Sextant of the planes.
