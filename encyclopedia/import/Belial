Belial was one of the Lords of the Nine, a ruler of Phlegethos before the Reckoning. He was allied with Baalzebul, Moloch, and Zariel, and remains tied to Lord of the Flies. Two of the original members of the Dark Eight originally worked for him before taking on their present positions.
After the war, Belial thought it best to keep a low profile, and officially "retired" in favor of his daughter, Fierana. He has an alliance of some kind with the god Telchur, and may or may not be holding the god Vatun in a magical prison.
Belial typically manifests as a handsome, fiendish-looking man with red skin. His consort was Naome, though there are rumors of an illicit relationship with his daughter as well.
