Tharizdun, known also as the Dark God and the Elder Elemental Eye, is an ancient deity of madness, entropy, and darkness eternal. He is credited with the corruption of the Unseelie+Court and the destruction of at least one nation on the Prime+Material. Many think he is the father of the five Princes+of+Elemental+Evil. He is associated with the Far Realm.
According to myth, Tharizdun was such a threat that the powers of Good and Neutrality united to banish him to a demiplane+of+imprisonment. Others say his mortal cult died out and he drifts, nearly dead, in the Astral Plane. Still others claim the Dark God hovers in the darkness outside the Multiverse, waiting patiently to complete his work at the end of all things.
