Also known as storm children, night rattlers, and lightning-kin, thunder children are mischievous, malicious creatures that come out to "play" during violent thunderstorms, especially at night. This play is quite harmful to other creatures. They are found in an isolated realm of  the Quasielemental Plane of Lightning.
These "children" are shiny black, gaunt humanoids, with slender limbs and vestigial wings. Their faces are human, though they have tiny horns on their temples and pointed ears. Thunder children have pupil-less eyes that flash like lightning. They average four feet in height.
Thunder children have their own language, which consists of crackling, howls, and booms. Many also speak Common, and are experts at mimicking normal sounds such as squeaking doors, heavy footfalls, and the like.
They live in little caves hollowed out from storm clouds, wandering the Plane of Lightning in little autonomous tribes. 
They are genderless creatures who reproduce by flying into storm clouds and getting hit by lightning - this either represents in the creation of a new thunder child, or in the original thunder child's death. 
Thunder children have no leaders. They act together because it is advantageous to do so. The djinn, Air elementals, cloud and storm giants, and pegasi consider them to be enemies due to their capricious nature. They don't interact with lightning+quasielementals or Shockers.
