Aasterinian is the draconic demigod of learning, invention, and pleasure.  Her realm is Brassberg in Nidavellir on Ysgard, although she also frequents the Outlands.  She appears as a huge brass dragon, and her holy symbol is a grinning dragon's head.
Aasterinian serves as her father Io's messenger, though not a very reliable one. She is chaotic, flighty, and laughing, and has nothing of the gravity of her mighty father - yet she still has a reputation of playful danger, unlike the more friendly Hlal. Like the Fated, she encourages her followers to think for and trust in themselves.
