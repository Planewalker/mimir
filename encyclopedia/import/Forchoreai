Forchoreai are celestial creatures similar to large white or gray stags with pearly antlers. They are native to the Beastlands. They regenerate, they can become invisible, and they can use living plants as doorways. If they are killed as part of a hunt on their native plane, they are resurrected in three days. This is a common trait in the Beastlands.
