The dergholoths (DUR-goh-loth) are one of the strongest types of yugoloths, however they are also one of the dumbest, lacking even the incredible intellect of the canoloths. They fill much the same roles as the mezzoloths do, but they perform it in a less orderly and effective manner. Dergholoths spend much of their existence milling about and generally being loathsome. They are usually quite proud of their milling abilities and skill at being loathsome.They are 8-foot tall, insectile creature possessing a round, chitin covered body with five arms protruding from its body along with three stumpy legs. Sticking out from its wedge shaped head are a pair of sharp looking mandibles that drip with a green, viscous substance.
