The Weeping Stone Catacombs are a region in UnderSigil, a series of tunnels beneath the Ditch originally constructed to hold some of Sigil's dead. Now they're haunted by ghouls and vargouilles, the strangely living stone faces in the wall wet with slimy muck leaking from the Ditch above. If only they had a source of fresh water.
The Weeping Stone Catacombs are near the Drowned Nations.
