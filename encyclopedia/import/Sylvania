Sylvania is the Gate-town to Arborea. The site is often described as a big party, and seems to twist and turn to no end; the buildings are more works of art than practical structures. Prominent locations include the Sensate embassy and the temples to the Greek powers and the Seldarine. The "portal" to Arborea is simply getting oneself lost in the local woods. Once you're thoroughly lost, Arborea finds you. On the other side of the portal is Thrassos.
Sylvania is ruled by a group of posessor entities known as the Seven Spiritors.
