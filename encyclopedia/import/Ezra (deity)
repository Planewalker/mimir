Ezra is one of two deities apparently native to the Demiplane+of+Dread (the other is Hala). Ezra encourages her followers to battle corruption and destructive forces wherever they're found, but the church's definition of "corruption" is very subjective. 
Ezra's realm in the Outer Planes is unknown. It's possible that Ezra does not even exist, but is instead a lie created by Ravenloft's Dark Powers. 
Other deities worshipped in Ravenloft include Bane, Lathander, and Belenus.
Ezra is also the name of a Bleaker working at the Gatehouse. See Ezra.
