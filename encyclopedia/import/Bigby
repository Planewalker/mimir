Bigby is a powerful wizard from Oerth, a former apprentice of Mordenkainen and still his most reliable ally. He is a pale, gaunt, hooded man.1
Somehow, Bigby has become famous enough in Sigil that the locals built a statue in his honor.2 There was also once a school there called Bigby's College of Academic Arts, but it was seized by the Fated for tax evasion and turned into the Hall of Records.3
Bigby was once imprisoned and impersonated by the greater Yugoloth Zender.4
