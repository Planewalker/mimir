Some hold that if one had the eyes to see, the world would be revealed as a symphony of celestial music. For some bards, this intuition is true. They see the underlying overture that connects all levels of reality.
Bards are more highly regarded on the Upper Planes than rogues because, though some of their skills are occassionally unfortunate, they represent art and clarity of mind. A lower-planar creature considers a bard useful only to sing its praises.
