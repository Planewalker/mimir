Collecting a million different currencies into a single setting can bring a lot of difficulties. What's puzzling in the Multiverse is that there seems to be a universal appreciation of gems. Gold, silver and other things aren't universal in their worth, some fiends don't even value them at all, but gems... That's a different story. Gems are universally appreciated equally across the planes and why they are so scarce is as difficult to guess as how the Spire is endless but yet seems to have it limits. 
Some traders make great profits finding Portals to unsuspecting Prime worlds and uses currencies in shortage there to gain great profits for themselves. In a strange way however, things always seems to even out. The Merkhants see this as a natural tendency for supply and demand, others see it as chaos in harmony.
