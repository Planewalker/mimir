Cherry Blossom is the realm of Izanagi and Izanami, two greater deities from the Japanese Pantheon.  It is located in Abellio on Arcadia. Cherry Blossom is a realm of eternal spring. The other Japanese gods, who are all their children and descendants, come to the realm occasionally to pay their respect, but for the most part the pair are left alone. It is said that working together, Izanami and Izanagi can create anything in the multiverse.  
There isn't any detail on the realm in Planes of Law; On Hallowed Ground has the most detail. In Japanese myth, Izanami has separated from Izanagi since her death while giving birth to the god of fire, existing as a corpselike creature in the Underworld. Furious at her husband and all of life, she vowed to kill everything that lives. Izanagi, for his part, vowed to create more than she could destroy. Thus, the two created death and birth.
In Planescape, the two have somehow reconciled and now live together in a paradise. The consequences of this to the cycle of birth and death have been unrevealed. 
In fiction, I recommend The Grass-Cutting Sword by Catherynne M. Valente, the graphic novel Sei: Death &amp; Legend by Sho Murase, and the comics series Lucifer by Mike Carey for their takes on the myth of Izanagi and Izanami.
