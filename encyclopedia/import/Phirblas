A phirblas is a curious creature, like a younger-looking Dabus without horns. They communicate through written script that appears above their heads in the language of the intended reader. They inhabit a Demiplane called Inphirblau, a city-realm filled with tall towers elegantly carved and shaped from living stones. Some say Inphirblau is one of the oldest of demiplanes, though how this is known, and how long the phirblas have been living in it, is not clear. 
It's been suggested that the phirblas are the ancestors of dabus, or perhaps their descendents.
