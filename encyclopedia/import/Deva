Devas (DEE-vahz) are beautiful humanlike Aasimon with large, feathery wings. They serve the powers of good, often at the points of their swords. Sometimes they are led by planetars.

Astral devas work the will of the powers of Good in the Lower Planes.
Monadic+devas serve the powers in the Inner Planes.
Movanic+devas are the most privileged of all, for they aid mortals on the Prime Material Plane.
