Zadara the Titan is one of Sigil's Golden+Lords. 
Zadara is a Titan with the power to detect the potential status of any person. As such, she's a collector and also a sponsor of some of the influential projects of Sigil. If you're looking to undertake a mission and are a little strapped, it's never a bad idea to stop by Zadara's case. It's a hard one to miss as well; the 25-foot titan lives a bit large. 
She's served by two fallen Sword Archons who act as screeners for anyone who comes to call. 
She was once revered as a Power on the prime world of Rubila, but a rival power put a stop to that. She's now a bit of a shut in, despite her huge ego and larger than life personality.
