Ithaqua, the Wind Walker, appears as a cloud of fog or snow, huge but human in shape with blazing red eyes.  When seen passing overhead, one gets the illusion of two bright stars close together.
Ithaqua is worshipped by the natives of the far North because of his ability to control weather (triple the range and effects).  His worshippers propitate him with human sacrifices, which he carries off, no one knows where.  Years later, their frozen bodies are sometimes found buried in snow drifts.  Ithaqua will also pursue and capture anyone who sees or annoys him, or meddles with his worshipers or thier stone altars in the forest.  Sometimes, his victims return to earth alive, but they never survive long, as they die from strange unnatural causes.
It is known that Ithaqua serves Hastur is special missions of great importance. He ordinarily dwells in the Elemental Plane of Air.
