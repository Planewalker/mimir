In swampy Othrys, the first layer of Carceri, there lies a certain hill. High, dry ground is a rare thing in Othrys, but this particular hill's got something even better - a ring of standing stones erected by ancient, forgotten gods. These stones act as Portals to a variety of other planes, including Sigil, Mungoth, and the Prime Material Plane. 
Naturally, this site has been considered a great prize for both Tanar'ri and Baatezu. Neither one's been able to capture it yet. Something - be they trolls, Gehreleths, the swamp itself, Titans, or one another - has always driven them away.
