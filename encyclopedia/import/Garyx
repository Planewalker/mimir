Garyx Firelord, a god of the Draconic pantheon, represents the destructive and cleansing aspects of flame. As the All-Destroyer, he is worshipped by red dragons. As the Cleanser of Worlds, he is worshipped by some rogue gold dragons who have come to the dark conclusion that the only way to cleanse the world of evil is to sterilize it and start again.
He dwells in Pandemonium.
