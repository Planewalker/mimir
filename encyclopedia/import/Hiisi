Hiisi, Lord of Darkness, is the greater god of evil in the Finnish pantheon. Chaotic evil in alignment, he rules a Realm on the Prime Material Plane called the Netherlands; it is an underside of a tree-covered hill, with dangling roots and the stench of rotting earth. Indescribable creatures drag their way through its lower reaches. It manifests whenever he believes the other gods aren't watching him. 
Hiisi always appears as a huge, richly robed man with course features.
