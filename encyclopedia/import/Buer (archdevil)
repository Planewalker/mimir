Buer is a baatezu+noble in the direct service of Asmodeus. He is in turn served by 15 companies of pit+fiends. He is inclined to melancholy demeanor and, though always polite in speech, appears to delight in practical jokes. His words and actions are perfectly controlled, and always further a specific aim or purpose. His loyalty to the Dark Lord of Nessus is not in question.
Physically, Buer resembles a Bariaur with gleaming silver skin and white hair. His eyes, horns, and hooves are scarlet. From his hips grow six 10' long prehensile tentacles, dripping with acidic bile. 
Buer is also the name of a Vestige.
