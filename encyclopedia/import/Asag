Three-legged, three-armed creatures who resemble large rock outcroppings, the asags were banished from the Elemental Plane of Earth by powerful sorcerers. They can raise small armies of xorns from fields of rock and stone. Some believe they once ruled the Elemental Plane of Earth, and now wander the planes in search of vengeance.
