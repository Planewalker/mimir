Death of Innocence is the feeling one gets when one abandons the dreams of childhood and grimly resigns oneself to one's fate. 
It's also a town tucked in a pine grove in Niflheim that exemplifies this philosophy. Yet somehow the town's ruler, Viliki Cainor, retains a kernal of optimism hidden in her despair that keeps the town functioning. Though the inhabitants have put aside the dreams of the past, the future may yet hold promise. The very process of abandoning what didn't work offers hope in the midst of hopelessness. In this, Viliki is secretly aided by the Revolutionary League - after all, the oppression of the Gray Waste is just as tyrannical as any government.
