Rummeles are natives of Ysgard, though they're also found on Limbo, Arborea, and the Material+Plane. They resemble long-limbed dogs with pendant ears and long, slender muzzles, prehensile paws, and wooly coats, although they can also take humanoid form. They can climb walls like rogues, blink like blink dogs, turn invisible, and knock arrows from the air. They are generally well-meaning, if unreliable.
