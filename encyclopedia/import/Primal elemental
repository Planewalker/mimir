Colossal in size, godlike in power, Primal elementals are the most potent incarnations of the basic elements that compose existence. Their existences date back to the beginning of time. 
The intellects of these creatures are not as sharp as that of elder+elementals or elemental+monoliths - they are too old, too much like landscape, too synonymous with their planes. Their power, however, is unsurpassed by any but perhaps the archomentals, and perhaps it is greater even than they are. Only the four elemental+rulers, who wield the power of greater deities, can reliably order these elementals around.
