Fudo-Myoo, the Immovable, is the chief of the ‘Five Great Kings of Science’ and puts evil demons to flight. His body is blue-black, and of a stocky shape. His teeth protrude from his mouth, one eye is dilated, the other contracted. He carries a sword in one hand, and a rope in the other. He is either standing or sitting on a diamond-hard rock. surrounded by flames. He is a support “in all enterprises requiring strength of purpose.”
