A Githzerai Zerth, Dak'kon is the last known wielder of a "karach" (chaos-matter) blade, which alters its shape, appearance and abilities depending on the power and mental state of its owner/wielder. Unlike most githzerai, Dak'kon is lawful neutral. He is a capable wizard and an even more capable warrior, making him a very valuable ally throughout the game as he can adapt to different situations easily, going into melee or casting spells, whichever the situations call for. However, his coal-black eyes hold a deep, secret pain, one that weighs on his very soul.
Dak'kon can be acquired early in the game and is found in The Smoldering Corpse Bar. He joins immediately after TNO first talks to him. Through careful dialogue with Dak'kon you can explore the philosophy of the Githzerai and learn his history as well as a number of magic spells. It later turns out that Dak'kon made an oath to follow TNO until either one of them died, not knowing that TNO was, in reality, immortal and thereby bounding Dak'kon to TNO for eternity. TNO can find out more about his past through Dak'kon as the game progresses, though this is most evident near the very end of the game.
