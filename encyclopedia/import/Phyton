Phyton is a lesser deity worshiped on the world of Oerth as patron of nature, beauty, and farming. 
He manifests as a tall, slender human, or as any creature of the forest. Although a human deity, he currently dwells with the Seldarine in Arvandor, though he also has a realm in Ysgard. Because of Phyton's chaotic good bias, Obad-Hai counts him as an enemy. His dominion over beauty angers Wee Jas.
