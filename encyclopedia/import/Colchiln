Colchiln [/b]are a breed of lesser Tanar'ri. Minion demons, they are created from the damned souls of the lost; they serve and follow, having little imagination of their own. 
Colchin have black, scaly skin and lidless, bulbous white eyes. They have four fingers on each hand, each tipped with a metallic claw. Each is around three and a half feet tall.
