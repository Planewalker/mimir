Tezca is a deity of Maztica, the patron of the sun, fire, smoke, lava, fireflies, snakeskin, lizards, and lamplight. He is very similar to the Aztec god Tezcatlipoca. 
He is pictured as a fire-faced giant with orange skin. His realm, Teotli Itec, is in the Abyss. Teotli Itec encompasses nine Abyssal layers, which Tezca shares with Zaltec and the chaotic evil souls of their people.
