Kesai-Serris is a prostitute of the mind at Fall-From-Grace's intellectual brothel. She's a voluptuous woman with a thick mane of hair and crimson eyes, like rubies with fires lit behind them. Her specialty is talking about dreams, often erotic but not always.
She's the half-Night Hag daughter of Ravel Puzzlewell, though she doesn't share her mother's evil nature. She shares the same cambion father as Kimasxi Adder-Tongue. Though the half-sisters work in the same brothel, they loathe each other.
