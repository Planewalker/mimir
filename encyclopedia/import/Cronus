The youngest of the Titans born to Uranus and Gaea, Cronus was the ambitious one who attacked his father and then assumed the throne to become ruler of the universe. However, when his mother Gaea prophesied that one of his children would overthrow him as he had his father, Cronus proved just as despotic as Uranus. As his wife, Rhea, gave birth to the Olympian powers, he seized them and swallowed them up. His plan might have worked, had Rhea not tricked him into swallowing a stone instead of her sixth child. This god, Zeus, eventually returned to lead the successful revolt against him. Because of his past actions, Cronus was imprisoned in Tartarus (Carceri).
Because Cronus remains penned in Tartarus, he is unable to influence events on earth except through his avatars. Therefore, at least one avatar is constantly moving about Greece, promising men great rewards in return for worshipping Cronus and turning their backs on the Olympian gods. On occasion, these avatars rise to a position of power in a polis, and the result is invariably war as the avatar attacks the power bases of Cronusâ€™ rivals. Because of his imprisonment, Cronus cannot send omens or portents.
His Realm in Carceri, Mount Othrys, is a gloomy, crumbling place that causes all but those who celebrate entropy and gloom (like the Doomguard, Dustmen, and Bleakers) to fall into introspective depression. He rules his brothers and sisters with an iron fist.
