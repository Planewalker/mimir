T'zen'kil is a lesser deity of the Neogi Pantheon.
The name of T’zen’kil is invoked by neogi torturers and those in charge
of the slave pens. Worshippers are tattooed with grotesque black
symbols of pain. T’zen’kil looks like a black neogi with a whip for a
tongue. 
T'zen'kil is neutral evil, and dwells in the+Abyss, which the neogi call Karish.
