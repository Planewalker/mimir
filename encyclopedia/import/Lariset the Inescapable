Lariset the Inescapable was Factol of the Fraternity of Order before Hashkar. She disappeared from her quarters, leaving no evidence to her whereabouts. It's assumed that she discovered one of the Great Axioms and ascended to a higher level of power. Some even claim she replaced the Lady of Pain, becoming the latest to hold that office.
