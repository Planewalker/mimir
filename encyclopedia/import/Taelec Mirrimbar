Taelec Mirrimbar, the Fortress of Indifference, is ruled by the Nalfeshnee Tapheon, who made it from the twisted bodies of his victims. The inhabitants of the Fortress want no part in the Blood War.
The Layer of the Abyss on which Taelec Mirrimbar exists - the 348th by the Guvners' reckoning - was once ruled by an Abyssal lord called Thralhavoc, but he had to relinquish it in favor of other layers. It's a lonely, blasted plain of tumbled rocks, jagged pinnacles, and sinister gorges.
