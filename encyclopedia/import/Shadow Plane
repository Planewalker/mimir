The Shadow Plane is a Transitive Plane. It is a plane in between darkness and light, always in a state of dusk. 
In Planescape the Shadow Plane was only a Demiplane, speculated by some as being a sort of Quasielemental plane between Positive+Energy+Plane and Negative+Energy+Plane. 
When D&amp;D 3rd edition was released the Shadow Plane was transformed into a full-fledged Transitive Plane that connected different cosmologies with one another.
