Spectres are powerful undead that haunt the most desolate and deserted of places. They hate all life and light. A spectre looks much as it did in life and can be easily recognized by
those who knew the individual or have seen the individualâ€™s face in a
painting or a drawing. In many cases, the evidence of a violent death
is visible on its body. A spectre is roughly human-sized and is
weightless.
Spectres exist primarily on the Negative+Energy+Plane. 
Lemures are occasionally transformed into spectres or wraiths and sent forth to haunt the Prime Material Plane.
