In times long past, before the age of myth, Ephelomon was a consort of Tiamat, a red dragon of greatest size and strength. It is with Ephelomon that Gith made her pact, allowing the Githyanki to summon red dragons in times of need.
Ephelomon is long gone; Tiamat has had many other red dragon consorts since. The pact remains.
