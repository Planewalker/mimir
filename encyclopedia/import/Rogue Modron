Very rarely, for reasons not fully understood, a Modron will develop an individual personality and seek to make its own way in the Multiverse, no longer connected to Primus. 
This is unacceptable to the modron hierarchy, who are one modron short until the rogue is killed. In modron society, the penalty for individuality is death. 
Rogue modrons are also known as modron exiles. They take on forms similar to modrons of the quadrone caste. They are immortal and all physically identical in form (though they can have themselves altered). Their new personalities can diverge widely.
