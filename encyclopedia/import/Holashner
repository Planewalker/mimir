Holashner (The Hunger Below) 
Holashner is one of the few Elder+Evils to exist fully in the Prime Material Plane. Appearing as part squid and part centipede, this massive creature burrows through the deepest reaches of the world, driven only by its unending hunger. It eats stone, magma, creatures, and anything else in its path.
