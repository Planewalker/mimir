Gaknulak is a kobold demigod of protection, traps, stealth, and trickery. He is highly intelligent and carries a magical cauldron from which he pulls tools, unpredictable minor allies, and diverse resources for fooling others. He is wiser and more pragmatic than Kurtulmak, his master.
Gaknulak is depicted as a small, dark-skinned kobold with a mane of white hair, a cloak with bulging pockets, and a hand axe. He dwells in Khalas, the first Layer of Gehenna, in a Realm called Aknuthrak.
