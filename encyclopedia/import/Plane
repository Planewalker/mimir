A plane is an infinite expanse of existence, separated from other similar expanses by a metaphysical distance rather than a physical one. 
Planes are usually the home of some Alignment, element, paraelement, quasielement, Energy, or similar concept of cosmic scope. They can generally be divided into Inner Planes, Outer Planes, the Prime Material Plane, and the Transitive+Planes.
Planes may be divided into Layers.
Demiplanes are similar to planes, but finite in area and more limited in scope. 
Magic on a plane may be altered dependent on the nature of the plane. It may be enhanced, diminished or not work at all. Spell keys and Power keys may offset these effects.
