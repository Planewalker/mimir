Osprem is a lesser goddess worshiped on the world of Oerth. Her areas of influence include fisherfolk, sailors, ships, and sea voyages. She is shown as a beautiful gowned woman, a barracuda, a sperm whale, or a dolphin. She is generally benign, but entire towns have been wiped out by ice storms for transgressions against her. Her occasional lover is Xerbo.
Her Realm on the Elemental Plane of Water is called Whirlcurrents. She is lawful neutral.
