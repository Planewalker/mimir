Coriandor was an elven village mentioned in The Inner Planes, page 119. It contains a portal known as the Crystal Triangle or the Garden Gate, an almost invisible gate made of glass. Coriandor exists on both sides of the portal, both in Pelion and on the Quasielemental+Plane+of+Salt. They have a circle of magical protection which allows them to maintain a perfectly manicured lawn of grass on both planes, which can animate to kill invaders. The key to the portal is a handful of flower seeds.
