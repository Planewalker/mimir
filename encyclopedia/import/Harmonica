Legend tells of a site in the Layer of Cocytus in Pandemonium called Harmonica. In this place, the winds whip through a cavern with holes and tubes chiseled into gargantuan rock columns, creating a noise worse than anywhere else in the plane. Somewhere within this mazelike realm of tortured cacophony lies the true secret of traveling the planes without a Portal, spell, or device of any kind,. In all likelihood, this secret is a legend with no basis in fact, but that doesn't stop the occasional seeker from finding, then dying among, the columns of Harmonica. No one really knows what it does. It either gifts you with some boon or curses you with some horrible bane.
