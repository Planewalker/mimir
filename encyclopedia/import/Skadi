Skadi, goddess of earth, mountains, skiing, and winter, is the daughter of the frost giant Thjazi. She's a mighty huntress, second only to Uller. She dwells in Vanaheim, where she and Uller give chase to many fantastic creatures. She is considered a lesser goddess, and is of Neutral alignment.
Her father Thjazi was the giant who the Aesir hired to rebuild the walls of Asgard after they were destroyed by the Vanir. His price, payable upon completion, was the sun, the moon, and Freya. Loki distracted his horse (thereby creating Sleipnir), preventing him from completing it in time, and his life was forfeit. 
Skadi appeared later on, demanding a god for a husband as payment for the blood-debt the Aesir owed her for killing her father. Thanks to Odin's treachery, she ended up marrying Njord instead of Balder. They found life together intolerable, so she left him for Uller. Skadi and Uller have been together ever since.
