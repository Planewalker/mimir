Gorm Gulthyn, called Fire Eyes, the Golden Guardian, the Sentinel, the Eternally Vigilant, and the Lord of the Bronze Mask, is the dwarven god of guardians, defense, watchfulness, and vigilance. He appears as a dwarf in full plate armor with a golden-brown hue carved with red, crawling, ever-changing runes. 
Gorm's Realm, Watchkeep, is in Shurrock, the wilder layer of Bytopia. Gorm is said to keep constant watch from the roof of his tower, from which he can see the entire plane. Many dwarven defenders hope to stand guard in Watchkeep after their deaths.
