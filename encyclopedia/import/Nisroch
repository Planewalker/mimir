Nisroch, “The Eagle,” is the poisoner of the hells, a baatezu+noble exiled to Avernus for destroying the duke Senciner (who has no entry in this Encyclopedia, as he is permanently dead) and nearly killing Abigor. He is polite, cruel, faintly mocking, and darkly humorous. Nisroch’s unblinking stare rivets most who look upon him; he says little and observes much. 
He now has little chance to practice his favorite art, poisoning sumptuous feasts, but instead contents himself with concocting deadly poisons from the sparse ingredients at hand in Avernus, and poisoning corpses and other food sources to surprise the unwary.
Nisroch appears as an upright male humanoid with an eagle’s head, black feathers upon his head and chest, yellow eyes and talons, humanoid arms, and batlike wings protruding from his shoulders, separate from his arms. Where he is not feathered, Nisroch’s leathery, hairless skin is dusty black in hue. His elbows end in upswept, barbed spines.
