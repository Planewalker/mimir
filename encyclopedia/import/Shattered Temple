The Shattered Temple was the great temple to Aoskar in Sigil. When Aoskar was killed, his temple was destroyed by a great explosive force. If buildings can be flayed, Aoskar's temple was. 
The Athar built their headquarters in the temple's desolate shell, a powerful symbol of the frailty of the so-called gods. 
After the Faction War, a massive temple to the Olympian god Hades was built in its place, a spit in the face of the departed Athar.
