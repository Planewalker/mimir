Paladine likes Majere a lot. He likes people that sit and do nothing, like monks. They are really, really boring. Nothing to borrow on them at all and they say strange things like "Finding the way inside", or "Seeing with eyes shut". That's like saying nothing at all! Why close your eyes to see the road, when you just can keep them open and see it just fine?

Majere dwells in Amoria, the first Layer of Elysium and also the home of Mishakal. His realm is called Contemplation.</p>
Some dragonlance's novels characters have the last name Majere, specifically Raistlin and Caramon, so not confound that with the name of the god.
