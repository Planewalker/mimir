Although Shang-ti has established an entire Ministry of Thunder nominally led by Wen Chung, the ministry is dominated by Lei Kung, the Celestial Bureaucracy's Duke of Thunder. In his true form, he is an ugly, blue-skinned brute with wings and claws. He is clad only in a belt and loincloth, with drums hanging from his waist. In his hands he carries a hammer and a chisel.
Although he has several duties, Lei Kung’s favorite is that of vengeful punisher of undetected, wicked deeds. He also hunts down and destroys evil spirits that have dominated human bodies, or humans who have committed crimes not governed by mortal law. Lei Kung treats all of these criminals the same — he uses his chisel to strike them dead.
Another of Lei Kung’s duties is to beat the drums hanging from his belt during storms. He performs this duty while several other deities perform similar tasks required to make rainstorms.
Lei Kung is a malicious deity who enjoys inflicting pain on mortals and spirits alike. As long as there are plenty of wrongdoers for him to track down, he remains content. But when he runs out of deserving victims, he often listens to the false accusations of spiteful rivals or suspicious neighbors. The only omen Lei Kung ever bothers to send is a deafening roar of thunder as he strikes a victim dead. 
Lei Kung's Realm of Resounding Thunder can be found on Acheron's first Layer of Avalas. The realm is a place of sound and fury centered around his dark fortress, the Firecracker Palace, which floats on a great storm cloud throughout the plane. His Petitioners sometimes leave the realm on missions of vengeance.
