Cyclopes (singular: cyclops) are one-eyed giants. Some say they are somehow related to the Giant Pantheon, but most link them to the Greek Pantheon of gods. 
Lesser cyclopes were fathered by Poseidon and usually dwell on islands. The greater cyclopes are assistants to Hephaestus. 
Another race, cyclopskin, are only slightly larger than humans.
