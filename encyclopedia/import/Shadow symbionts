Shadow symbionts are mysterious beings from the Plane of Shadow. Appearing on their home plane as harmless amorphous blobs of shadow-stuff, these sentient creatures can assume the form of an object, typically a garment, and enter a symbiotic relation with a willing planewalker in order to be taken away from the Plane of Shadow.
When worn, shadow symbionts begin to feed on the wearerâ€™s life energy, and grant him special benefits in return. The shadow symbionts often feel incomplete if separated from each other, and try to influence their wearer to find the missing symbionts.
