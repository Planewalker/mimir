Mezzoloths (METZ-oh-loth) are dimwitted, simple Yugoloth soldiers, the most basic of their kind. They are born from within the laboratories of the Tower+Arcane or Khin-Oin, shaped from the raw energy of Evil, or from the passionless, awkward mating of any two lesser+yugoloths.
Mezzoloths who fail to perform adequately may be transformed into canoloths. Those who show enough intelligence to unmask the simple bluffs of the dergholoths are transformed into dergholoths themselves. 
Mezzoloths are large insectoid creatures with off-white, chitinous armor.
