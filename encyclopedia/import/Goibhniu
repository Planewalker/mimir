The smith held a special fascination for the Celtic peoples. Smiths were thought to have magical powers of charm and healing, bestowed upon them by the celtic Power of the smiths, Goibhniu. Goibhniu is actually one of a triad of gods; Luchta the wright and Creidhne the worker in metal are also important gods who serve as Goibhniu's proxies. Together they fashioned weapons for Lugh at the battle of Magh Tuiredh, each doing his part to create sound, sure weapons. Reputedly, weapons forged by the great Goibhniu will never miss their mark, and those stuck by them will certainly be slain. In the great Feast of Goibhniu, the god serves a variety of foods and drinks which can soothe, heal, and even make immortal their consumers.
Though his size and appearance may at first be threatening, Goibhniu is a generally warm and friendly fellow. He is especially fond of sharing stories of battle and fine armaments. He often makes food and drinks for those he befriends, sharing with them a small feast â€” the wines and dishes of which will be of a magical nature and will both prolong life and heal damage. However, when made angry, Goibhniu sends forth his avatar and will show no pity, slaying mortals who have crossed him without so much as a second thought.
He resides in Tir na Og in the Outlands, in a realm called the Great Smithy. The Great Smithy is at the base of an exposed hill constantly thundering with the sound of hammers.
