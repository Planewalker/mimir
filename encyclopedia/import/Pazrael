Known also as Pazuzu, Pazrael is the Abyssal Lord of the Upper Air. 
Pazrael is the ruler of Torremor, the 503rd Layer to be catalogued in the Abyss, and he claims ownership of all Abyssal skies. He delights in mortal corruption. The lord is served by harpies, kenku, vrocks, Nabassu, and many other winged beasts as well as other races who have fallen prey to his false promises. 
Pazrael is a rival of Graz'zt. With Malcanthet, he is the father of Red Shroud, and therefore the grandfather of Fall-From-Grace. Another former consort of his is Lamashtu. He was originally a member of the Obyrith race, but he has grown more Tanar'ri-like over the eons.
