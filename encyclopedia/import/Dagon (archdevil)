Dagon is a baatezu+noble exiled to Avernus. He was formerly known as Jaqon, the least duke in the court of Asmodeus. In that capacity he traveled freely about Baator as the herald and messenger of Adramalech and Asmodeus, as Martinet and others do today.
Often summoned to the Prime Material Plane, Jaqon had a habit of trading more information than Asmodeus wished divulged, including hints as to the truenames of various other nobles and the preferences of various she-devils with regard to an archdevil winning one of their hands to be his consort. For this pandering, he is especially despised by all of the consorts and she-devils in the hells; none will aid him, work with him, or even speak civilly with him.
To make Jaqon’s exile a punishment rather than a mere inconvenience, and to lessen his treachery against the hells, it was necessary for Asmodeus to end his frequent summonings to the Prime. The Overlord accomplished this by branding new words onto Jaqon's spirit, forcibly changing Jaqon’s name to Dagon, the name of an Obyrith prince — an insult to both Jaqon and the demon Dagon, and a means of confounding the familiar summoning rituals used by Prime Material plane conjurers. The Overlord did not destroy his former herald because Jaqon’s continued existence — and knowledge of the consort’s truenames — remains a threat to many of the consorts, thus ensuring their loyalty to Asmodeus, upon whose protection they must depend.
Dagon usually appears as a red-skinned satyr with a slyly handsome, hairless visage, pointed ears, and short, curving horns like those of a Pit Fiend. His eyes are green, and shine brightly when he is angry or excited.
