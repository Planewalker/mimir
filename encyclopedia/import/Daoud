Daoud is a hero-deity from the world of Oerth. Once philosopher-king of the nation of Tusmit, he was reduced to beggery. He began teaching that the so-called Four Feet of the Dragon revered by most of his people (honor, family, generosity, and piety) were shams, and the true four virtues were honesty, humility, poverty, and endurance. He has many priests today who follow his path, living lives of poverty and speaking with brutal honesty to those in power.
Daoud is neutral in alignment. He was sponsored to divinity by the goddess Istus. He is closely associated with the artifact that bears his name, Daoud's Wondrous Lanthorn, which burns precious gems for fuel and has a wide variety of powers, many of them relating to color and light.
