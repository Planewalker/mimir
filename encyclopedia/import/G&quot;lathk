G"lathk are Githyanki farmers. They harness the strange energies and Ectoplasm of the Astral Plane to grow food on a timeless plane where nothing should be able to grow, including funguslike organisms that require no sunlight and a tiny grub that grows only within the flesh of Dead Gods, and tiny plants and animals in tanks and pools of specially treated water.
No one needs to eat on the Astral, but g"lathk produce is essential on expeditions to other planes, where extreme hunger strikes those who time catches up on.
