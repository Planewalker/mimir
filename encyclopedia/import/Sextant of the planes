This is a magical device that identifies the planar traits of the plane the user is on. It is a brass sphere about 4 inches across filled with crystal lenses and myriad control knobs and levers. It is much lighter than a Celestial etheroscope and does not require the arduous training of the latter tool.
See also the Dimensional sextant.
