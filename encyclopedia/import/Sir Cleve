Both a good friend and employee of Kesto Brighteyes and an top-knotch deterrant to shoplifters at the Parted Veil bookstore, Sir Cleve is a Bodak - a "benign bodak," to be precise, one who has retained enough memories of his former life that his old personality is more or less intact. Sir Cleve was a Paladin from Krynn, slain in the+Abyss while rescuing his kidnapped lord from the watery caves of Demogorgon. Although his body died, his spirit lives on in bodak form, and he's still a paladin at heart.
