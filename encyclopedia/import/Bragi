Bragi is the Norse Pantheon god of poetry and song. The son of Odin and Gunlod, Bragi was born in a stalactite-hung cave, put aboard a boat made by the dwarves, presented with a magic golden harp, and set adrift. As the boat floated out of the cavern, Bragi took the harp and began to play the song of life. With his song, he has the power to make plants grow and bloom, and to charm any animal into doing his will. In his true form, Bragi resembles an old, white-bearded man with a sparkle in his eye. He is married to Idun.
Whenever people sing or recite poetry, they are worshipping Bragi. Since this is a favorite pastime in almost every hall, Bragi never lacks worshipers. He is a special friend to bards, often revealing to them the location of secret treasures. Most often, this revelation occurs as a sudden insight while the bard is singing before a large crowd. If the bard interrupts his song, however, he immediately forgets the location of the treasure.
Although he may visit his family in Asgard, his personal Realm, Harphearth, can be found in Eronia, Elysium's second Layer. It is little more than a mountain peak where the bracing winds of the upper air flow. Bragi keeps a cottage there, where Idun often visits.
