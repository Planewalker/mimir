Pitspawned materials are forged in the Abyss. A pitspawned suit of armor or shield is dark in color, but when the light hits it at the right angle, dark tones of blood-red seem to refl ect from its surface. Good creatures grow uneasy at the mere sight of such an item because of this unusual effect. Abyssal smiths most often apply this template to light armor because speed is a fundamental requirement for Abyssal armies.
Like pitspawned armor and shields, pitspawned weapons are dark in color and have a blood-red cast when viewed at the proper angle. These weapons tend to reflect the Tanar'ri combat philosophy of overwhelming foes with massive damage.
