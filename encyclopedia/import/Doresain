Doresain is the King of the Ghouls, a lord of the Abyss in vassalage to Yeenoghu (though chant has it the endlessly hungry being occasionally wins his way free, which isn't surprising in the Planes of Chaos). Before Yeenoghu, Doresain was a vassal of Orcus.
The Ghoul-King resembles an especially thin and wasted ghoul wearing an elegant white cloak. He is thought to have demigod-level power, and teaches his ghoulish worshippers that to exist is to eat.
