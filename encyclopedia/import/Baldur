The son of Frigga and Odin, Baldur is the norse Power of beauty and charisma. He is also a warrior of considerable skill, and is as wise as he is handsome. He often serves as the patron of sages. As a young god, Baldur had dreams of doom, so his mother extracted promises from all things not to injure him, overlooking only mistletoe. The gods take great delight in his resulting invulnerability, and often make contests of bouncing axes and spears off his chest. Unfortunately, Loki plans to kill Baldur one day with a spear made of mistletoe. Baldur has the power to increase the Charisma of any being.
Despite his attractiveness, Baldur is not a vain god. He is loyal to Odin and the other Aesir, and never fails to fulfill his obligations to them. When an ugly man or woman demonstrates his worth by performing a self-sacrificing deed of great importance, Baldur often rewards the individual by increasing his or her Charisma. Omens from Baldur are usually delivered by a handsome or beautiful member of the opposite sex.
He lives with his wife Nanna in Asgard. Their hall is called Breidablik, Broad Splendor.
