Chamo is a baatezu+noble who serves Belial as legate, and plans one day to supplant his master. Polite but abrupt, Chamo always appears calm and fearless, but perhaps he fears Fierana more than Belial. He is said to know every hiding place in Phlegethos, and possesses an iron-shod staff capped with the linked (by rings of beaten brass) skulls of sixteen paladins defeated by him over the years. 
Chamo appears as a white-haired, middle-aged man with big brown eyes. He has upward-pointing horns, black hooves, a forked tail, and black bat-like wings. His skin is scarlet, darkening to blue on his long-nailed hands. He usually wears loose robes of black with a high stand-up collar.
