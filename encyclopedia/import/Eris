Eris is goddess of discord in the Greek Pantheon, said to be the sister of Nike. The story goes that they have three apples of immortality between them. Eris uses these apples to sow mischief, while Nike gives them to the deserving.
Some say she is the sister of Tyche as well, and was instrumental in driving her sister from the Pantheon.
Eris is Chaotic Neutral. She dwells in Ysgard.
