Geryon was a former Lord+of+the+Nine. He ruled Stygia from the time after Levistus's imprisonment to a civil war in which Geryon played a crucial role, after which Levistus was given back his old station.
For millennia Geryon stewed in his Citadel Coldsteel, plotting vengeance. At last report, however, he had been destroyed by the Dark+Lord+of+Nessus.
Geryon is said to have looked something like Mammon, only much hairier. He was also known as the Wild Beast and Lord of the Filth.
