Ghoresh Chasm is a yawning, miles wide and long rift in the Gray Waste, formerly the site of a Yugoloth city, swallowed and presumed destroyed during the Wastequake that created the chasm.
The initial formation of the chasm is often referred to as the 'Ghoresh Chasm Incident', due to the subsequent events following the exploration of the depths of the rift.
At the uttermost bottom of the chasm, yugoloth explorers discovered a massive seal, presenting symbols of evil, chaos, and law intertwined with one another. Further investigation of the seal seemed to suggest that it could only be opened by the willing cooperation of all three major fiend races, themselves spanning the ethical axis of Evil.
In the wake of this discovery, and communication between the 'loths and their counterparts in Baator and the Abyss, the Blood War halted for the second time in recorded history. At the edge of Ghoresh Chasm, representatives of the three fiend races met, intending to mutually open the seal at the base of the rift, but things never progressed that far. A seat set aside for a Pit Fiend was claimed by a Balor, and the subsequent fight scuttled the cease-fire and any attempts to discover what was held at the bottom of the chasm.
Since that time, it is unknown if the yugoloths have discerned anything further regarding the nature or origin of the seal itself, or the cause of the initial wastequake, and Ghoresh itself remains an enigma.
