Tantlin [/b]is the capital of Stygia in Baator. 
The city of Tantlin is built on an iceberg with a natural harbor. Its Pit Fiend ruler - she has no name, befitting the amnesic quality of the Layer - manipulates the cities' various factions against one another, allowing their conflicts to erupt frequently into violence.
