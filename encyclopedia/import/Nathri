Nathri are a savage, short-statured race native to the Ethereal Plane. They have green skin, flat noses, large pointed ears and (typically) black hair. Fierce and wild (but not evil), they survive by raiding and plundering adjoining planes and Demiplanes. Their leaders, called targai, direct them to attack in swarms.
Nathri can eat anything organic, but prefer things that taste good. They don't care for Xill, and often fight skirmishes with them.
