Touts are guides to the various wards and districts of Sigil who sell their services to any individual in need. Typically visitors to Sigil and the Clueless especially require their aid in learning about the city in general, or simply to find a specific person, place, or general area of interest within the Cage.
Of late, within the past few years, the touts of Sigil have become organized and founded their own guild (Escorts and Touts Guild) under the banner of Kylie the Tout, one of Sigil's more easily recognized public figures. 
To a lesser degree, the term 'tout' might be applied to a guide to any place throughout the Multiverse. Touts who work for a Faction are called factotums.
