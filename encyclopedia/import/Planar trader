Traders of various kinds are found throughout the planes. Many traders are Cagers who sought a way to get out of the City of Doors, at least for a while. No trader can ignore the importance of Sigil, and a great number make the city their base of operations. The mercanes are planar traders. The Merkhants are a Sect dedicated to wealth through trade, and there is a Planar Trade Consortium. Many members of the Free League and Fated factions appreciate the mercantile life, and Sigil's Golden+Lords have made astonishing levels of wealth from it. Dao are infamous slave traders, as are the Tso.
Prominent trading houses in the City of Glass include Silverpick, Alrahad, Elsinore, Andromeda, Meladril, Lubraboorp, Acquar, Sharpeye, Jalal, Dolomite, Victrox, and Krokus.
A rival of the Planar Trade Consortium is Aleena Jerkot.
