Called the Hidden Empress, Johydee is a hero-goddess revered on the world of Oerth. Her areas of influence include deception, espionage, and protection.
Long ago, at the beginning of the Oeridian calendar, she freed her people from the rule of worshipers of evil gods, then vanished. It is known that she was a powerful priestess, but who she worshiped has been forgotten. She is best known for her signature artifact, the Mask of Johydee.
Strange, otherworldly people with exceptional magical gifts are known as "Johydee's Children" in her honor.
