The deities of Cerilia are worshipped on the world of Aebrynis. The human deities are no more than 1,500 years old. When the previous Cerilian pantheon died in a battle with their brother Azrai at Mt. Dreismaar, their power passed to their most devoted and mightiest champions, who became the new generation of gods.
