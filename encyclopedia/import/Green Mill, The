The Green Mill is a tavern in Sigil's Lower Ward that caters to elves, fey, and others who long for forests and trees in polluted, smoggy Sigil. And it delivers - in its courtyard are found the largest, and probably only, trees that The Cage has to offer. Some even claim the elves who run the tavern have planted a seedling of Yggdrasil there, though Yggdrasil's seeds are reputed to be sterile.
A waterwheel attatched to the building is turned by the turgid waters of the Ditch.
