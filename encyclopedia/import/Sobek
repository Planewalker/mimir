Sobek, also known as Sebek, is a crocodile-headed god of the Egyptian Pantheon, the son of Set and Nephthys, and the half-brother of Anubis. He is variously considered neutral evil or lawful evil.
He is said to dwell in the Prime Material Plane, but there is an article on Planewalker.com describing his realm in Acheron. He spends much of his time lurking in Set's realm.
