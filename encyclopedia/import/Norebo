Norebo is a member of the Suel+pantheon, probably the most popular next to Kord.  He is a god of luck, gambling, and risks and a patron of thieves and assassins (though not the assassin prestige class - he considers thieves and assassins who use magic to be "cheating").  The current mythology has him dating Wee Jas, as unbelievable as that may be.
Norebo's Realm is somewhere in Pandemonium. It has not been officially named.
