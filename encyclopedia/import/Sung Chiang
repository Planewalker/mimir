Sung Chiang, also called No Cha, is the Chinese god of thieves. He has stolen bits of other gods' realms to form the &nbsp;Teardrop+Palace in Khalas, the first Layer of Gehenna. The Palace is a marketplace for stolen goods across the Multiverse. It is guarded by his proxies and by the Linqua.
Sung Chiang manifests as a man with three faces, eight arms, silvery scales, and red eyes that blaze like fire, or sometimes as a squid. In fact, he appears in so many forms that it's impossible to describe them all. He often fights with a flaming spear, or just throws a brick at people.
