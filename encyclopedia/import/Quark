Quarks are a race of Lomendur native to Limbo. They often serve as familiars for chaotic neutral spellcasters. Natural shapeshifters, they may appear as any normal plant, animal, or natural object from small to tiny, changing again every round.
In their true forms, quarks look like tiny humans of slender build, with silvery skin and tangled, fuzzy hair that resembles a dandelion gone to seed. They have glittering butterfly wings that change pattern and color daily or even hourly. Despite their strange appearance, they have a certain charm and beauty.
