The dead goddess Mystryl was patron of magic, spells, the Weave, wizards, spellcasters, energy, creativity, knowledge, invention, song, time, and springtime. She was depicted as a beautiful human female with rainbow-colored hair, radiant skin, and burning blue eyes, or as a primatic form made of glowing balls of light. Her Realm, Dweomertor, was in Limbo.
She sacrificed herself to save the Weave after the machinations of Karsus. After Mystryl's death, she was reincarnated as Mystra.
