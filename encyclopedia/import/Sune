Sune, or Lady Firehair, is the goddess of love and beauty in the Forgotten Realmscampaign setting. She is depicted as a beautiful red-haired woman. Unlike most other fickle love gods, Sune represents deep romances and quick flirting. She has been in love with many of the gods of Faerun, and enjoys the attention.
 Gods of romance and beauty such as Hanali Celanil (Of the elves), Sharess (whom she rescued from Shar during the Time of Troubles) count among Lady Firehair's allies. Deities like Lathander and Sel√ªne also aid her. Any god that destroys beautiful things (Such as Tempus, Talos, or Malar) gains her emnity.
 Sune's church is loved by many, although their reputation as flighty, vain hedonists keeps the church from gaining any real power. Her clergy, some of whom take up the Heartwarder prestige class (Faiths and Pantheons, p. 196), seek out enjoyable things, whether sensual or aesthetical. They sponser artists and support the trade of art, and many of the clergy create beautiful things themselves.
Her divine Realm is in Brightwater, where she rules over the Heartfire Quarter. The Heartfire Quarter's a much more private place than any of Brightwater's other districts, for only the followers of true passion go there, those seeking perfection rather than a big party. It's known to contain Portals to Vanaheim, Olympus, and Arvandor, in the realms of Freya, Aphrodite, and Hanali Celanil. It's also occasionally the site of the fountain Evergold.
