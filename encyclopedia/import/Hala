Hala is one of two deities (the other is Ezra) apparently native to the Demiplane+of+Dread, a goddess of healing, charity, and empowerment. She is said to have been one of nine deities who created the World from Chaos at the dawn of time and originally placed creatures of flesh there. She taught the first thirteen witches and warlocks to use the arcane magic of the Weave, and it is said she created the first hag from an abused human woman, gifting her with the power to avenge her suffering. 
Her realm on the Outer Planes, or even if she has one, is unknown. It's possible she does not even exist, but is only a lie created by Ravenloft's Dark Powers.
Other deities worshipped in Ravenloft include Bane, Lathander, and Belenus.
