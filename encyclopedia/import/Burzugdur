Burzugdur were once evil mortals who died and sank to the Lower Planes, becoming Larvae. Tanar'ri transform these larvae into Quasits, Baatezu transform them into Imps, and Yugoloths transform them into Nalgs. They often serve mortal spellcasters as familiars.
The neutral equivalents of burzugdur are called Lomendur. The good equivalents are called Galadur.
