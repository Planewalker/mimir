Erythnul is a god of hate, envy, panic, ugliness, slaughter, and malice worshipped by some humans and nonhumans on the world of Oerth. He is called the Many, because in battle his features continually shift from human to bugbear to troll to ogre to gnoll and back to human again. His blood transforms into similar creatures. He sponsored Roykyn's ascension to the status of Hero-power.
His Realm, the Citadel+of+Slaughter, is in the third  Layer of Pandemonium, Phlegethon. Previously, he had a realm called the Fields of Malice in Cocytus.
