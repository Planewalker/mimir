Lamashtu is the Tanar'ri queen of monstrous births, currently imprisoned by her former lover Pazrael.
Lamashtu was once Pazrael's consort, but she betrayed him by abusing her knowledge of his true name. In retribution, Pazrael put out her eyes and banished her to the Abyssal layer of Torremor, in the sprawling construction known as Onstrakker's Nest.
Onstrakker's Nest is built on a towering spire from timber, bones, earth, and stone pillars, is hundreds of miles in diameter. Lamashtu is impaled on a gleaming spire.
