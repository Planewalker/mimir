Girru is a god of the Babylonian Pantheon, a lesser god of fire. He is lawful good. He hates all things evil and will destroy them if he can. He continually sends clerics and Archons on missions of holy retribution.
His Realm, the Undying Flame, is in Mercuria. This realm is sculpted entirely of fire which burns only those whose thoughts are impure. He usually manifests as a man with a flaming beard.
