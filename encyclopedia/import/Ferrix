Ferrix is a goddess of weretigers that dwells with the Cat Lord in The Beastlands. Her portfolio includes playing, hunting and curiosity. She is the feminine counterpart to her brother Balador, the Mother Tiger to his Father Bear. Some myths say that Balador and Ferrix are somehow the complements of the primordial shadow-archetype of Daragor and Eshebala.
