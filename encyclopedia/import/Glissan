The glissi (singular: glissan) are Galadur native to Bytopia, Elysium, and the Beastlands. They often serve neutral good spellcasters as familiars. They take the form of seven-year-old human or demihuman children or appear as songbirds, seagulls, or miniature unicorns.
In their true forms, glissi are slim and delicate creatures with opalescent skin and large blue eyes. They have fine, silvery hair that forms a halo about their head, and a double pair of silver-white wings, shaped like a swallowâ€™s.
