    <div class="dice_rolls">
</div> <p><font size="5">Avernus</font>The first layer of Baator is a wasteland of broken concrete, barbed wire and choking smog. Under an eternal rain of flames massive factory complexes churn out armaments for the diabolic legions, while in immense courtyards the fiends themselves drill endlessly in preparation for the next battle against the Tanar'ri. Filling the factories and the training grounds are the twisted soul shells and lemures, working endlessly under the eyes of greater fiend overseers.  Those who do not meet expectations or fail to fill quotas are turned into raw materials for Hell's terrible war machine.Amid clusters of industrial horror are gleaming academies for the elite of Baatezu society, where Pit Fiend generals are trained in the arts of tactics and administration.<span>The Bronze Citadel</span>Towering over the surrounding industrial complexes and training grounds stands the Bronze Citadel. A fortress city built of tarnished scrap metal, the central power of Avernus appears at first to be a blasted and decrepit wreck.Appearances, though, are deceiving - under the decay and rust lies a core of stainless steel and fiberoptics. From his comand room at the citadel's heart, Warlord-Regent Bael can observe and command anything within the entierity of the first hell.<span> The Pillar of Skulls</span>Towering high into the clouds of soot and smog, this landmark is a testament to the Devil's might in war and a visual history of their enemies.  Near the base of the tower the mostly demonic skulls display almost as much metal as bone, while the higher, and older, reaches of the tower are pure; a reminder to the devils that, as they have changed and grown greater, so have their enemies, and that they should never grow complacent in the propagation of Law and Evil. At the Pillar's base old Tiamat rests, not reduced by her scarred hide and sightless eyes. She guards the stairway from Avernus to Dis, while her chromatic children attend to her wills and desires.<font size="5">Dis</font>The second layer of Baator is a city of red hot stainless steel.  Skyscrapers rise like an eternal and terrible forest, the streets are packed with vehicles and the sidewalks bustle with the economic comings and goings of the city's fiendish occupants.Within the glowing towers soul shells and lemures shuffle between cubicles and offices, delivering the commands and dictates of the Baatezu Elite to the lesser fiends that labor endlessly, designing and programing and filing and accounting, slaving away endlessly to fufill the plans and purposes of their masters.  In their top-floor offices, the Baatezu nobles plan and scheme, playing an intricate game of economic diplomacy and sabatoge.<span> The Iron Tower</span>Above the city's tallest skyscraper rises the Iron Tower, the executive center of Dis. Out of place in this city of glowing metal and burning glass, the tower is sculpted of black iron as if by a demented gothic architect. For all its twisted monstrosity, it displays a dark symmetry and darker purpose. Within this baroque monstrosity resides Dispater, the Executive-Regent of the city.  From the tower he can observe everything that happens in his domain, every petty victory and defeat in the war of currency and trade that rages below him, every plot and plan of his underlings.<font size="5">Minauros</font>The third layer of Baator is a damp wasteland of thick, soft mud and decay.  Littering the grounds are the corpses of ancient beasts, forgotten even by immortals.  Rising from the muck are industrial furnaces that produce consumer goods to be exported and sold to the rest of the Hells.  The massive revenue produced is sucked into the coffers of the Minauros bureocracy, and most of the workers are destitute.<span>The City of Minauros</span>Rising into the sky like some ancient and decrepit beast is the city of Minauros, from which the layer gains its name.  The lower levels of the city are relatively uninhabited, and house the vaults of the bureaucrats and tax collectors.  The stone from which these layers are built is old, damp and scored by acid;  a silent testament to the great acidic swamps that once filled the layer. Above the vaults are the manors of the Bureaucrats and Tax collectors themselves - vast, decadent estates filled with servants and slaves.  At the highest point in the city lies the estate of the Viscount-Regent Mammon, a mausoleum miles wide crafted from the finest marble in the planes.<span>Jangling Hiter</span>High above the muck and decay of the plains below, the Kyton city of Jangling Hiter is suspended by huge chains of steel and iron.  Within the city of Chains, the Kytons regard each other as equals but defer to Qytel. The Kytons have taken over the vital role as the bankers of Hell, and most transactions go through the Hanging City, There, the masters of chains forge links of debt which contract into a jingling net spanning and binding the entirety of Hell.<font size="5"><span>Phlegethos</span></font>The fourth layer of Hell is a giant urban sprawl. Unlike Dis, the buildings here are daibolic casinos, massive entertainment halls and titanic brothels, all lit by flame from below and flashing neon lights from everywhere else.Filling the streets are lesser devils, indulging in the vices and pleasures offered by the pimps and the pushers.  Luxury vehicles for the elite and nobility traverse less crowded routs, leading directly to the V.I.P. suits and the most extravagant hotels and entertainment facilities. <span>Abriymoch</span>The heart of the great city, Abriymoch, is located within the caldera of an extinct volcano, and is the home to the lord and lady of the Layer, Belail and his daughter Fierna.  The city is made up almost entirely of brothels specializing in the most sadistic of perversions.  Mortals and outsiders of all types can be enjoyed here, and have been enhanced magically to regenerate the wounds inflicted on them by their clients.  At the center of it all, Lady Fierna holds lavish orgies of suffering and pain for the highest of the high in the diabolic hierarchy.<font size="5"><span>Stygia</span></font>BUY!  BUY!  SPEND!  A SOUL SAVED IS A SOUL WASTED!  NEW SLAVES TODAY, JUST 3 SOULS A DOZEN!  BUY!  SPEND!On entering the Fifth Hell, a being is inundated with an endless stream of advertisements, propaganda and commercials for everything the mind could possibly imagine.  The layer is a frozen world, with massive ice floes drifting through frigid seas.  Under the waters, built into the undersides of the frozen bergs, are cities surrounded by magical wards that keep the waters of the styx from pouring in.  These wards are not entirely effective, and a mind numbing mist swirls in the streets, slowly sapping the will and memories of the petitioners and fiends that dwell here. Everywhere are vision screens, magical resonators projecting telepathic messages, billboards, speakers and a host of stranger media. In the mental void left by the stygian mists, these media inject messages to buy, spend, do this, do that, belive this and obey that, all in an uneding torrent. In these cities the goods produced in Minauros are sold according to the economic plans of Dis, all advertised by the media of Stygia.<span>Tantlin</span>Once known as the City of Ice, Tantalin is the one city free of the unending torrent of advertisement.  Here is the marketing core of the layer, where the ad campaigns and the subliminal messages that bombard the rest of the layer are created.  In the harbor of the city is a massive iceberg in which Leviathan is trapped.  In the facets of the ice flickering images can be seen, all displaying the mental conditioning constantly being concocted by the lord of the Fifth.<font size="5"><span>Malbolge</span></font>The sixth layer of hell is an endless maze of stone cliffs. Steel scaffolds cling to the sheer cliffs like the webs of spiders. It is among these scaffolds that the slaves of hell labor endlessly, harvesting the raw materials poured into the machines of Avernus and Minauros.Smoke belches from the hanging refineries, poisoning the air and staining the rock faces while their wastes are thrown into the endless depths; a filithy rain falling on the lower refineries and mining camps.<span> Palace of the Countess</span>At the center of the massive web of scaffolds, suspended between two of the endless cliff faces, the Regent-Hag supervises the endless mining opperations.  She sells to every layer of Hell, reaping great rewards in the process.<span> Lost Camps</span>Dotting the endless expanses of cliff faces are the rusting remnants of those camps who failed to meet the quotas set to them by the Hag countess.  Within these webs of rust and decay strange creatures lurk, their horrific howlings echoing up through the canyonsand terrifying the slaves of hell.  These scaffolds are observed by specially asigned devils from Nessus, who bear authority equal to a duke of hell. <font size="5"><span>Maladomini</span></font> The Seventh Hell is a world of ruined citys, crumbling roads and rusting iron.  Beneath the broken shadows of this ruined wasteland, lesser devils huddle in sagging buildings, broken and defeated, bereft of the slightest hope of acension through the ranks of their race.<span>Malgaurd</span>Rising from the ruin and decay of the layer, Malgaurd is a titanic white and grey city which gleams in the dim light. Within the city, devils of all ranks move about their lives according to prescripted plans, performing actions and thinking thoughts all chosen by the supreme master of the city, Regent Beezulbub.Every action is carefully observed and documented, every movement examined, every thought cataloged by the legions of observers, and all this is passed on to Beezulbub. Any deviation from the norm is stamped out, every subversive element culled. Identical devils perform identical tasks in identical rooms of identical buildings in identical blocks of the perfectly symetric city.<font size="5"><span>Cania</span></font>The Eighth layer of Hell is wrapped in eternal cold.  Massive glaciers rise from plains of ice, buried by an undying blizzard.  The entire layer is lit by the surreal glow of fiberoptic cables running through the ice, and the frozen wastes are criss-crossed by cables conveying information to and from sealed labs where fiendish researchers conduct horrific experiments in the search for new knowledge.<span>Mephistar</span>In the end all the cables carrying information, all the waves of communication, converge on Mephistar.  Here, Lord-Regent Mephistopheles sifts through the masses of data, deciding which projects shall be funded and which shall be cut, which discovery will be released to which researchers, which technologies will be implemented and which shall be stored away for some other time.All knowledge comes to the Frozen Lord, but only what he wants leaves.<span>Shapes in the Ice</span>Deep within some glaciers of Cania, strange shapes can be seen.  Around such glaciers are zones of darkness where no cables run.  These zones have been declared off limits to the fiendish research body as a whole, and only specially assigned fiends are ever given a chance to study them.<span>Experimentation Camps</span>Amidst the glowing icebergs lie massive camps, cut off from the rest of the plane by magically sealed walls of jagged metal. In these camps, the &quot;research subjects&quot; of Cania are collected.  Each camp specializes in a particular form of subject - camps for elves, humans, dwarves, and exemplar breeds can all be found. Some camps are even more specialized, containing only members of a particular subrace, religion, political leaning, or whatever classification can be imagined. In the camps some &quot;research subjects&quot; undergo horrific tortures and strange treatments, while others are kept healthy and fit so as to provide the maximum amount of variety for testing.<span>The Pit</span>Surrounded by a ledge of titanic icebergs is the Pit.  The primary access point to Nessus, the Pit is several hundred feet wide and emits an uneding torrent of steam. Elevators, wrought from superheated steel, are built into the sides of of the pit and it is from the points where they touch the frozen walls of the pit that the steam issues.  These elevators are guarded by legions of fiends.<font size="5">Nessus</font>The Ninth Hell. Of all the incarnations of Law and Evil, this is the most true.  Here, no factories belch forth smoke, no lesser fiends toil endlessly at the whims of their dark lords.  That is the job of the other Eight. Here the ground is an endless, glassy plain of still-hot obsidan, with all cracks and imperfections smoothed out.  Rising from this endless expanse of solidified flame are pristine cities of white marble and steel.  Under lightless skies, the Baatezu rulers of Hell govern the affairs of the other Eight, their constant interference reminding the Lord-Regents of who truely sits upon the Serpent Throne of Hell.  Here, in the deepest pits, the diabolic slaves of Hell are untouched by the baseness and dirt of the layers above; the horror that they inflict upon the universe is reduced to numbers and lists, commands to faceless servitors and minions.<span>Malsheem</span>Towering into the sunless sky, the great citadel of Malsheem is the largest structure in all the planes.  Hundreds of miles high at the least, this is but the tip of the iceberg.  Worming its way deep into the very surface of Nessus, the great Citadel houses armies vast beyond anything every fielded in the Blood War, legions of Pit Fiends larger and more cunning than any others of that breed.From his place on the Serpent's throne, Lord Asmodeus watches and commands all of the Hells.  His gaze is omnipresent, as is His will.  For the Dread Lord to blink would bring relief and succor to all of Hell, if only for a moment.The Lord of the Serpent Throne never blinks.<span>The Serpent Chamber</span>Rumor speaks of a chamber within the deepest layer of Malsheem, far deeper than any Lord of the Nine or Duke of Hell has ever set foot. There, the miles long True Form of Asmodeus rests in a sea of its own ichor, its ancient wounds slowly healing.Those who whisper these secrets last no longer than a day before their destruction.</p>   </div>

Isn't the logical starting point either the Prime or Sigil, with an introductory explanation of how d20 modern plus planescape isn't PS with guns in it? </p>

<p>If it's Baator you want, I'd prefer a description of activities and day-to-day practises of urban baatezu rather than a description of familiar sites and people, with skyscrapers and factories randomly thrown in.</p>

<p>I'm sorry if I'm being overly negative, I love the idea and am eager to see how it all turns out, but sadly, this article isn't too promising.<br />
</div> Actually, the project itself is in it's infancy and is still being slowly developed. People just submit what little bits and pieces of info and ideas that they can. </p>

<p>No particular reason. <img src="http://planewalker.com/sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/smile.png" title="Smiling" alt="Smiling" class="smiley-content"/> They just seemed to be already well under way, and don't you just hate it when someone jumps in and starts questioning the premises that a bunch of other people were working on for a while.</p>

<p>However, now I'm thinking of asking a few questions in the urban planes section here.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Look, I respect the idealism presented here, but it needs a lot of work. The idea of combining the Planescape - I mean the "WotC" version of Baator - with D20 modern is a good "idea", but the practicality is very lost. Afterall, if the person had done some research - this overview - in its entirety, would be so much more detailed and filled with dozens of places and sites of worth and note. This piece feels like the person who wrote this just took the WotC manual of the planes and typed out the names of the layers and places they liked and then filled them in with a re-hash - or D20 "Modernized" version of the WotC provided - information regarding them. That is not an Overview - thats S***. Point being, why didn't they use anything from the Planes of Law Box set? Or the AD&amp;D guide to Hell? or even the Hellbound Box set? I mean, sure - Modern D20 is easier to get ahold of - but real effort comes from real research. This is definitely a matter of censure, unless people are going to start doing some real research. After all, How do you go about explaining a modern Krynnian what the "Modern" Abthalom, the Nether Reaches looks like? Oh wait, the author forgot to fill in details regarding realm where Takhisis dwells. What about Grenpoli, a major city on the layer of Maladomini? Of course, the city of Democracy would be rather controversial to write when trying to fit it with Modern D20 - so what happens? The author leaves it out!  With all offenses, the Author is being SAGED - because this piece is a piece of S***.</p>

<p>Well, have a nice day.</p>

<p> Its difficult to say. I am... sadly... Against the Idea, Ideology, and the Aberration otherwise known as Planescape 3rd Edition. The problem is that by making Planescape 3rd Edition without uniting all of the former D&amp;D/AD&amp;D campaign settings will lead to a fascist uprising - of the likes of those that adhere to the Sword&amp;Sorcery edition of Ravenloft. I mean, I would love to help contribute and further understanding, but I am aptly opposed to the cause it will also be furthering - Planescape 3rd Edition. Planescape 3rd Edition is a grotesque concept that cannot be properly done/created until the following campaigns are all united under one banner: Greyhawk, Dragonlance, Spelljammer, Red Steel, Birthright, Forgotten Realms, Al-Qadim, Lankhmar, Mystara, Dark Sun, and Ravenloft. I would like to see the recreation of TSR or a like-minded group, since I find both S&amp;S and WotC to be conceited and capitalistic to the point that they couldn't really give a damn about the people who use or play Pen(cil)&amp;Paper RPGs. We don't need Planescape 3rd Edition as much as we need to re-unify D&amp;D/AD&amp;D, because that is what Planescape symbolized - all the prime material planes being connected to the planes of existence. Now, if you go and look in the Planar index on this site... all you'll find is Greyhawk and Forgotten Realms listed as prime materials... What about Krynn? What about Athas? What about Kara-Tur? What about Cerillia? or What about the Known World of Mystara and or the Savage Coast? All of these prime worlds connect to Planescape. They are what makes Planescape - Planescape - and so many refuse to acknowledge that. Now I ask you, would you contribute to a cause that does nothing more then destroy what Planescape really is?</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Athas gets mentioned in a number of Planescape books (<span style="font-style:italic">The Inner Planes</span>, the <span style="font-style:italic">Planescape Monstrous Compendium Appendix III</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">Faction War</span>, and the <span style="font-style:italic">Planescape Campaign Setting</span> boxed set, for starters). </p>

<p>There are Athasian elves in Pelion, Athasian halflings in the Sigilian neighborhood of Curleyfoot, and another Athasian neighborhood in Sigil called New Tyr. Ruvoka and psurlons come from the Dark Sun campaign as well. The campaign setting box mentions that defilers and preservers use their magic the same way on the planes.</p>

<p>But despite all that, I don't think the world is a vital part of the setting. All those references could be changed to, "a nameless desert world" without losing anything that's inherent to Planescape itself. </p>

<p>Planescape linked all the AD&amp;D worlds (but not Nehwon, the home of the Lankhmar campaign, since that was based on Fritz Lieber's novels and not really something created or owned by TSR, only licensed - I mean, you can link it to Planescape if you want, but there was no official link ever mentioned). However, Planescape never <span style="font-style:italic">depended</span> on those worlds to exist - it's something that would be just as awesome if it didn't touch any other official settings at all.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>A lot of the regular (and yes, I use that term loosely) planescape material out there focus's on the planes instead of the primes.</p>

<p>Spending energy on updating all the different D&amp;D settings from medieval style to Urban is rather besides the point, instead focus should be on Sigil, the Outlands, the Abyss and so on. Update/convert these places into Urban first, then (if at all) worry about the prime material plane(s).</p>

<p>We should be asking and answering questions like "How is daily life on Arcadia?" or "What are the githyanki doing?" and "How have the factions adapted?". <br />
These things, these planescape specific things, are what holds the setting together, heck, they ARE the setting, the fact that you can throw in all the other D&amp;D settings is all well and good, but if you didnt have an Abyss or a Blood War that wouldnt matter.</p>

<p>Take all things from the standard (another term I use at my own risk) planescape setting and update/convert them.</p>

<p>Spending energy on updating all the different D&amp;D settings from medieval style to Urban is rather besides the point, instead focus should be on Sigil, the Outlands, the Abyss and so on. Update/convert these places into Urban first, then (if at all) worry about the prime material plane(s).</p>

<p>We should be asking and answering questions like "How is daily life on Arcadia?" or "What are the githyanki doing?" and "How have the factions adapted?". <br />
These things, these planescape specific things, are what holds the setting together, heck, they ARE the setting, the fact that you can throw in all the other D&amp;D settings is all well and good, but if you didnt have an Abyss or a Blood War that wouldnt matter.</p>

<p>Take all things from the standard (another term I use at my own risk) planescape setting and update/convert them.</p>

<p>*Munin gets off his soap box*</div></p>

<p>First off, welcome to the forum.  There's a lot here, so I would recommend reading through what we already have so you don't bring up point we've already discussed.</p>

<p>Second, I think that you have an excellent point that many of us take for granted, but sometimes forget when we try to rationalize the alterations we make to the setting.</p>

<p>Also it's funny you should mention <a href="forum_.html" class="bb-url">Arcadia...</a></p>

<p>And here's <a href="forum_.html" class="bb-url">Elysium.</a></p>

<p>Btw, we really need a sticky and FAQ for newcomers.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Those questions were just examples.. but thanks for the links.</p>

<p>As for the FAQ, I think its a really really good idea. I've just about (or so I think) got the workings of the regular planescape setting figured out, but how far the urban setting has gotten, which planes/races/factions have been dealt with is rather confusing for a newcomer and its very hard to get a feel for the setting.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I'd like to make a suggestion now without trying get to far inot the problem. If you want to make an Urban Planescape or any new planescape setting. I have always been of the oppinion that you should write the WORLD. not the system. Nything writen for urban planescape should be done without a hint of Edition rules. For example. you want to recreate Planescape, great dont mention editions, just right the world, dont try to fit it to a rules set when obviously the rules set will inevitably change. Instead write out the world as true to the Planescape premise as possible and let the Current edition dictate how the world is run in a campaign. otherwise you'll have an endless game of Catch up on your hands.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

I thought it was a good first effort to get things rolling. I'd be much more impressed with suggestions of imagination then bleeped out cursewords in one's criticism.
</p>
<p>
I remember one idea that caught my fancy was that all of Hell was an inverted skyscraper, with the CEO being at the very bottom. I could imagine that very room recalling that shutting door in Godfather.
</p>
<p>
One possibility of CEO rather Monarch is that Hell has faster turnover and possibly shareholders. Asmodeus may run things for now, but he needs the support of the secretive masters to keep himself on top.
</p>
<p>
It really requires shifting not just the landscape imo but the economic/political model. Can Hell exist as a democracy for example would be a question worth exploring.

Of course keeping in mind that the original post and response to it is nearly 2 or 3 years old <img src="http://planewalker.com/sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/wink.png" title="Eye-wink" alt="Eye-wink" class="smiley-content"/> ... At the time about half of the effort was aimed at the world, half at mechanics to support that world as that was the existing mix of interest in the volunteers.

The Urban Planescape project is still here, though fairly slow going as a lot of the original folks seem to have vanished from the face of the internet - it could use some new bloods to revitalize it if you folks are interested. <img src="http://planewalker.com/sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/smile.png" title="Smiling" alt="Smiling" class="smiley-content"/>

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><p>
I'd suggest you read INFERNO, by Niven and Pournelle. It is a modern take on Dante's Inferno. Dante's Inferno was a major inspiration for the nine layers of Hell/Baator that we're all familiar with.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Niven &amp; Pournelle's Inferno adds some modern ideas, but still kept to the original theme. Things like diabolic sports cars which tried to run down the narrator, harvesters chopping down the Grove of the Suicides, etc.
