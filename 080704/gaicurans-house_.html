</div> <table>		<tr><td><TABLE border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" width="650"><TR>  <TD valign="top">Just SurvivingGaicuran's HouseCopyright &copy; 2000 by Heiner de Wendt<p>General DescriptionThe whole building seems to be made of one stone; there are no single bricks or anything like that. The marble-like, white stone is cool in a comforting way. Although it can stand even extreme pressure, it is so soft that you could punch your head against it with full force and not even get a scratch.</p><p>The stone statues inside the building show humans, elves; succubi and incubi busy with various sexual pleasure acts. All stone statues are made of the same marble stone as the building, but are single pieces and not actually a part of the building itself. They are made by a master stonecrafter and nearly seem alive. It happens not too rarely that the guests &quot;interact&quot; with the statues instead of living persons. </p><p>The stone golems look exactly as the statues, but Gaicuran has enslaved the souls of various beings, trapping them in the stone bodies so that they can interfere whenever needed. The stone golems serve Gaicuran and his staff absolutely, but they are conscious and can act whenever a dangerous situation longs for it.</p><p>The building's ceiling is about ten meters high and about as bent as the whole building. Each wall is about four meters thick, has a magic resistance of 100% and can take 200 points of damage.</p><p>Gaicuran employs about thirty human women and ten human men, seven female and two male drow, as well as eight succubi and four incubi. They're all masters in the art of love.</p><p align="center"></p><p>The map1+3: One succubus and one incubus await the guests here (the fiends wear thin clothes of finest silk, showing more than it covers). Those who want can leave their inventory (sometimes even all of their clothes) here for their stay. Only those who received an invitation may come in, and even then only for a fee of five hundred gold pieces (this is an exclusive and luxurious place, berk).</p><p>2: There's a magical writing on the door which shows to everyone in his native tongue: &quot;Enjoy the pleasures of the Abyss; give in to the obsession&quot;. A strange smell is noticed here. It reminds one of blood, but is (to good characters probably very confusing) somehow very nice.</p><p>4: Room of Stars: This room is completely dark, except for the star-like glittering that drifts through the whole air. It's easy to completely lose orientation here, and often most guests fall in each other's arms here to give in to the intoxication of lust. A gargantuan bed made of a strange, but very comforting soft, slightly wet sponge, serves as the playground of pleasure for the guests.</p><p>5: Baths of the Nymphs: Three comfortable warm water pools, enchanted so that anyone can breath underwater here, are another playground for Gaicuran's guests. Three succubus and one incubus are here at all times.</p><p>6: Chambers of Love: Only thick curtains divide the various &quot;rooms&quot; here, in which couples (or more than two persons) can give in to each other's desires on thick, warm carpets. The sounds and sighs from the other guests usually heat up the guests even more.</p><p>7: Prison of Passion: For the more extreme tastes, chains, whips and things like that are available here.</p><p>8: Torture Chamber of Lust: Iron maidens (with the inside spikes just long enough to make very minor wounds), stretching tables, and an icy bath in which aggressive small fishes swim, satisfy the extra-ordinary tastes. A sealed glass sphere, of which the exit can only be magically summoned by Gaicuran and his staff, serves for those guests who want to become the object of voyeurism themselves. Gaicuran's staff usually doesn't let the guests out of the sphere when they ask for it - so that the guests get the impression they are really captured here and will become naked slaves for the rest of their lives.</p><p>The staff does release the guests soon thereafter, though - they seem to know instinctively when to do that. The guests afterwards usually tell that this &quot;prison-experience&quot; was one of the most mentally passionate moments of their life (yes, those who come to Gaicuran's house usually are sick).</p><p>9: Freedom of Obsession: This is a gravity-free chamber, in which guests can make love with each other or the staff while floating in nothingness.</p><p>10: Gaicuran's Private Chamber: This room can only be reached by Teleport Without Error. There is a trap here, though, which lets everyone teleporting inside fall into stasis for one turn. Only Gaicuran knows how to overcome this trap: You have to think &quot;I am Gaicuran, master of this house&quot; strongly while teleporting. This serves as a kind of &quot;spell key&quot;, keeping you from the stasis. Whenever Gaicuran wants to bring in guests, he simply accepts that they'll be in stasis for some time after he teleports in with them (they'll not even notice, so usually this isn't a problem). Gaicuran keeps four captured women here, two human and two elfish. They're imprisoned in glass spheres similar to that in the Torture Chamber of Lust. The women know that they can't escape, and have experienced that attempts to flee or fight only lead to horrible torturing, thus they do everything Gaicuran commands them to. Usually, he just enjoys watching them in their prisons, knowing that these particularly magical glass spheres will keep them young and alive forever.</p><p>One of the women is Gaicuran's favorite victim. He's immersed her in Styx Water a few years ago; so this poor woman doesn't know anything beyond Gaicuran's chamber now, and has experienced nothing but torture, rape and imprisonment. The formerly good-aligned woman is utterly insane by now, and slowly drifting to chaotic evil. Behind the gargantuan bed of Gaicuran (which is only used by him and really, really very important guests - but which is still very often in use) a secret door is covered in various powerful illusions. It leads to Gaicuran's treasure room, in which coins, gems and jewelry worth millions of gold coins are kept.</p><p>Furthermore, there is a bracelet hidden here, which Gaicuran continues to attempt to improve upon. The incubus longs for an item that will make its wearer the perfect lover. Actually, Gaicuran wants for the bracelet to drive both its wearer and the wearer's mating partner into such wild obsessions that their excesses will kill them.</p><p>The brothel's staff includes normal members of their race that not equipped with anything beyond what they need for their &quot;work&quot;. Gaicuran usually wears some extremely potent magical items. Surprisingly, all succubus/incubus staff members wouldn't hesitate to attempt gating in a Balor for help, and it's rumored that Gaicuran actually has the power to automatically gate in several Balors at once. If this is true, then either Gaicuran is far more than a mere incubus, or he's made deals with a whole bunch of balors - or someone who rules those powerful fiends...</p><p>Stone golems: AC 0Movement: 12HD: 10THAC0: 10No. of Attacks: 2Damage: 2d8 *2, SD +2 weapons to hitSize MMoral Fearless (20) Intelligence: 10-12Alignment Chaotic EvilXP 2.000</p><P></p><P> </p></td></tr></table></td></tr>		</table>   </div>
