          Using the Mirror Plane (now with Kamerel stats)        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
        <div class="dice_rolls">
</div> <p>The Mirror Plane mentioned in the 3e Manual of the Planes and under the Nerra entry in the Fiend Folio, existed back in 2e Planescape with the adventure dealing with the Kamarel in Tales of the Infinite Staircase.</p>

<p>But I currently don't like how the Plane of Mirrors are as it's described in the MotP (and the somewhat contradictorily mention in FF that time is static there when the MotP says it has normal time).  I get it's supposed to be a dangerous hidden plane, but it gets out of hand when there's too many mirror duplicates produced.  Especially every time you go to a different Mirror constellation.  In my opinion the mirror duplicate should only be dealt with once and never appearing again once defeated, unless the Nerra actually capture someone and make a new duplicate.</p>

<p>Secondly the Plane of Mirrors needs to be more than just corridors of windows to other planes.  Somewhere the corridor constellations have to lead to some sort of "Deep Mirror Plane" a universe of panes of some sort of reflective material suspended in a sparkling void.  Entered from a doorway hidden in each constellation, where the exit resembles a shimmering pool of quicksilver.   In the Deep Mirror Plane bitter nomadic clans of the Kamarel travel from pane to pane and the citadels of glass, crystal and almost solidly viscous liquid from the kingdoms of the Nerra stand...</p>

<p>Here it should have the traits:<br />
-subjective directional gravity<br />
-flowing time (haven't decided on the rate)<br />
-infinite size<br />
-magically morphic (shaped by Kamarel mirror magic mostly)</p>

<p>Destroying your mirror duplicate will draw the attention of the Nerra.  However while mirror duplicates come into existence the first time you enter plane of mirrors, they can only exist in the constellations and not the deep mirror plane.  The exact nature of the relation between the Kamarel and the Nerra aren't completely known, but they do seem to coexist without great incidences of violence.</p>

<p>Due to the nature of the plane, it's generally a secret plane to travel through, as it's been spoken of as being a very cursed and dangerous place, its mention only spoken of in hushed tones.  Corrupting those who have went there and came back (probably because they were killed by their mirror duplicate).</p>       </div>

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;Kobold Avenger&#039;</em> wrote:</div>However while mirror duplicates come into existence the first time you enter plane of mirrors, they can only exist in the constellations and not the deep mirror plane.</div>
That's an interesting way to think of the mirror duplicates but I've always had a different impression of their origins.</p>

<p>I like to think of the mirror duplicates as alternate material plane versions of the PC. They entered the Plane of Mirrors the same way and at the same time as the PC because in their alternate reality they were doing something similar. It just so happens that only 2 alternate selves (the "original" PC and the "mirror duplicate) will ever enter the same section of mirrors at the same time.</p>

<p>The whole idea of spawning a new sentient being, fully equipped, with the sole purpose of replacing the PC just doesn't make any sense to me. Where did the material to form this mirror duplicate come from? Why does it have some kind of premonition of the whereabouts and a drive to kill the PC?</p>

<p>With my idea it is just as likely the PC and alternate reality PC would run into each other as it would be that they had their own adventures behind the looking glass and returned to their material plane without every running into each other. It also opens up the possibility of meeting multiple alternate selves while limiting the total number of alternate PCs to the number of nearby mirrors in that section of the plane of mirrors.</p>

<p>Just some ideas I thought I'd throw out there,<br />

         <p>Well the alternate prime idea is an interesting one.  It leaves questions like, do different alternate version of primes have free will from the others?  And what about planars and actual outsiders?  Is there a mirror multiverse then?</p>

<p>Granted there's a lot of things about the plane of mirrors that just doesn't make sense.  Though I got the impression it was supposed to be a secret plane, kept secret because of the mirror duplicates.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

Tried to make them a little more than, "just humans with some extra abilities".  Designed them to be a creature that uses class levels, and has a bunch of supernatural abilities and tried to make them somewhat interesting with their abilities.  I added a few things in to make them have some similarities to the nerra.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

Their expressions are of shock and resentment for other beings, as they show their slightly pointed teeth.<br />

<span style="font-weight:bold">Mirror Walk (Su):</span> Kameral can move through mirrored and reflective surfaces at will.  This functions much like shadow walk, except that they travel through the Plane of Mirrors.  As a standard action a kamerel touches a mirror, and can exit through any mirror within a mile or stay on the Plane of Mirrors if they choose.  If it’s a mirror or highly reflective surface it happens automatically, if it’s a slightly reflective surface such as glass or a still pool of water, they only have a 30% chance of success.  No matter what it entered through, it can only exit through a normal mirror.  If there’s no mirrors within 1 mile, they remain on the Plane of Mirrors instead, and must exit through an actual mirror portal in some random location.  Since Kamerel are tied to the Plane of Mirrors, they produce no mirror duplicates on that plane.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Scry Mirror (Su):</span> At will a kamerel looking through a mirror can see what’s in front of any other mirror within a mile, for as long as they concentrate and stare at it.  They may not cast spells or attack through the mirrors they are looking through.  Unlike their mirror walk ability they must do this through an actual mirror, and can’t use reflective surfaces.  Otherwise this ability functions a lot like <span style="font-style:italic">clairaudience/clairvoyance</span>.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Spatial mirror (Su):</span> Given a few months depending on the size of the mirror, a kamerel can create the space behind a mirror real.  If it’s in a room it’s effectively the size of the room it duplicates.  If it’s outside it duplicates a 100 foot cube in front of the mirror.  Should the kamerel use this on mirrors facing mirrors, they create multiple duplicate spaces, perhaps even infinite numbers if they try enough.  This space behind the mirror is part of the plane it was created on, but a kamerel inside it can use the space to access the Plane of Mirrors using mirror walk, where they don’t even need to touch a reflective surface. <br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Synthesete (Ex):</span> Kamerel can shift their sensory input through to other senses.  Such as feel light or sound, they can shift a between these two stimulated senses as a swift action each round.  When feeling light they gain a +4 circumstance bonus to Sport and Search checks and are immune to gaze attacks.  When feeling sound they gain a +4 circumstance bonus to Listen checks.  Effects that confuse the senses, still confuses a Kamerel normally.  They can also use this ability to eliminate blindness and deafness, such as by seeing sound or hearing light.  Though when using their senses in this way, they can’t use their bonuses.</p>

<p>The Kamerel presented here has the following ability scores before racial ability adjustments: Str 12, Dex 13, Con 9, Int 10, Wis 8, Cha 11</p>

<p>The ancient race known as the kamerel were originally from the Outlands, they lived their eons before the rilmani became the dominant race.  The kamerel were quite a neutral race in that they quite to themselves mostly, they barely acknowledged the existence of other races, until they started bothering them.  Soon they grew to be xenophobic.  The kamerel had a knack for the magic of mirrors which they were able to utilize as low level magic effects, allowing them to use such magic so close to the spire.  When they became aware of other races, they used this magic to spy on them.  </p>

<p>Eventually one kamerel name Hallanoc used her mirror magic to create a library which contained the copies of any book written in the multiverse.  Her race hated her for that and saw to it that she was executed, and named this mirrored library Timaresh because they hated what it represented.  However the rilmani noticed the existence of this library and its value, and took it for themselves.  Soon this lead to an all out war, where the kamerel were overwhelmed as war with another race was inconceivable to them.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Strategies and Tactics</span><br />
The kamerel prefer to use hit and run tactics, emerging from a mirror and returning back to the plane of mirrors quickly.  In such assaults they are usually quite prepared as they’ve managed to scry ahead of time.  Before such assaults, if they are capable of using mirror image, they will.  Kamerel assault groups often come with sergeants known as drivers, who usually prepare for such ambushes with spells such as darkness.  They are also found of using traps, such as using summoned monsters from the Plane of Mirrors, and directing them through the mirror portals to attack what’s on the otherside.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Sample Encounters<br />
Kamerel raiding party (EL 7):</span> This kamerel assault team consists of 6 kamerel, lead by 2 drivers.  They emerge from a nearby mirror, using their best ambush tactics.  This raiding party may also include 3 varoot nerra or 1 kalereem nerra, raising the EL to 8.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Ecology</span><br />
The kamerel now reside in the Plane of Mirrors, where they live out a nomadic tribal existence, as refugees after all these years.  From the Plane of Mirrors they watch other planes and wait, for the time when they get the best opportunity to take back what they lost since their retreat.  While there are other forms of life on the Plane of Mirrors to support them, the kamerel do raid other planes for supplies and food occasionally.  It’s not quite known exactly what the nature of their relationship to the even more enigmatic nerra is.  It’s thought that they have some sort of alliance or live as subjects of the nerra rulers.  However some sages theorize that many of the kamerel have become the nerra after years of living on the Plane of Mirrors, as the nerra seem to be a relatively new race, with no ancient accounts of their existence from when the kamerel lived on the Outlands.  Other sages theorize that the kamerel are somehow related to the ancestors of many humanoid races such as humans and halflings, from times lost to history.  <br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Typical Physical Characteristics:</span> Kamerel are short humanoids, and tend to have wiry builds.  They often prefer to dress in the colours of white, blue or brown, yet they have a diverse range of styles.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Alignment:</span> Kamerel keep to themselves not caring about what happens to most races, except the nerra, but they bear no particular malice towards other races, despite their distrust of them.  Therefore almost all kamerel are neutral in alignment.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Treasure:</span> Kamerel don’t typically carry money, but they favour magic items especially ones that use spells related to mirrors and illusions, and some occasional jewellery.  Many of them prefer to carry ornately designed mirrors.</p>

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>I'm slowly thinking of ideas for flora and fauna of the plane of mirrors, along with some sites and phenomena.  Some ideas so far are, before I refine them some more...</p>

<p>Shard-flowers: Flowers with petals and leaves made of mirror-like 'shards' also a food source on the plane.</p>

<p>Simulacrum: Mirror copies of being and objects from other planes, created by the mirror constellations and forces unknown.   </p>

<p>Disc-wings: Disc-shaped 'insects' that's the mirror planes equivalent of flies.</p>

<p>Reflection storms: A storm of tiny mirror-shards that while not physically dangerous, happens to be very disorientating due to the cacophony of twinkling tones and thousands of reflections appearing and magnifying everywhere.  Said to contain small glimpses of alternate choices and possible futures, by those who can concentrate and make sense of it all.</p>

<p>Mirror-pools: These are pools of reflective and highly viscous liquid, and are often doorways to mirror constellations.  When on submerges into a mirror-pool they will find themselves in a constellation.  Many strange creatures often lurk in and around mirror-pools.</p>

<p>Mirror-crystal: Generally what passes for 'land' on the deep plane of mirrors floating in the shimmering void.  Most mirror crystals are large panes of reflective material often square miles in size, and usually about ten feet thick.  Some mirror-crystal exists in more 3-dimensional geometric forms.  On the plane of mirrors nothing casts a shadow, only reflections.</p>

<p>Shard-clouds/storms: Miniature mirror-crystals, often quite sharp and always dangerous, think of Ocanthus, Acheron for the general effect.</p>

<p>Scrying-window: Sections of mirror-crystals and mirror-pools sometimes can glimpse into other planes.  Most scrying-windows are usually in the middle of settlements of the Kamarel or Nerra.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Any chance you'd want to update these stats? Wanted to do something with the Kamerel and the Spire for the zine.</p>

         <p>I could update them in a while.  For Pathfinder all I'd need to do is give them CMB and CMD and remove certain skills like Spot, Listen and Search, and replace them with Perception and some other skills.</p>

<p>For 4e, I'd probably need to come up with a few different varieties, and I'd probably go with a skirmisher, a controller and maybe a soldier, ranging from heroic to low paragon tiers in level.  </p>

<p>PC stats, I may hold off on that as they have rather ridiculous stat bonuses when reverse-engineering them from monsters.  But I took a look at the playtest version of Pathfinders Advanced Races Guide for making a race.  For 4e PC stats I may have to take a look at the planetouched stats I made a while ago.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>I finally took some time away from video games (and this includes holding off on getting Skyrim) and other stuff, to finally convert the Kamerel stats I wrote years ago to Pathfinder Format.  </p>

<p>Already I've applied a couple changes such as upping their levels, in preparations for the 4e stats (as you can see some evidence of 4e'izing their abilities).  Some of the changes included changes because the Pathfinder classes are different from 3.5e too.  Hopefully I levelled them correctly and got rid of stuff that's changed from 3.5 to Pathfinder.  </p>

<p>As for 4e stats, do they seem fine enough respectively as a 3rd level skirmisher and a 5th level controller when I get around to writing that conversion?</p>

Their expressions are of shock and resentment for other beings, as they show their slightly pointed teeth.</span><br />

SPECIAL ABILITIES<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Mirror Hop (Su)</span> As a move action, a Kamerel adjacent to a reflective surface or creature can teleport to any reflective surface or creature within 60 feet.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Mirror Walk (Su)</span> Kamerel can move through mirrored and reflective surfaces at will.  This functions much like <span style="font-style:italic">shadow walk</span>, except that they travel through the Plane of Mirrors.  As a standard action a kamerel touches a mirror, and can exit through any mirror within a mile or stay on the Plane of Mirrors if they choose.  If it’s a mirror or highly reflective surface it happens automatically, if it’s a slightly reflective surface such as glass or a still pool of water, they only have a 30% chance of success.  No matter what it entered through, it can only exit through a normal mirror.  If there are no mirrors within 1 mile, they remain on the Plane of Mirrors instead, and must exit through an actual mirror portal in some random location.  Since Kamerel are tied to the Plane of Mirrors, they produce no mirror duplicates on that plane.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Scry Mirror (Su)</span> At will a kamerel looking through a mirror can see what’s in front of any other mirror within a mile, for as long as they concentrate and stare at it.  They may not cast spells or attack through the mirrors they are looking through.  Unlike their mirror walk ability they must do this through an actual mirror, and can’t use reflective surfaces.  Otherwise this ability functions a lot like <span style="font-style:italic">clairaudience/clairvoyance</span>.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Spatial mirror (Su)</span> Given a few months depending on the size of the mirror, a kamerel can create the space behind a mirror real.  If it’s in a room it’s effectively the size of the room it duplicates.  If it’s outside it duplicates a 100 foot cube in front of the mirror.  Should the kamerel use this on mirrors facing mirrors, they create multiple duplicate spaces, perhaps even infinite numbers if they try enough.  This space behind the mirror is part of the plane it was created on, but a kamerel inside it can use the space to access the Plane of Mirrors using mirror walk, where they don’t even need to touch a reflective surface. <br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Synthesete (Ex)</span> Kamerel can shift their sensory input through to other senses.  Such as feel light or sound, they can shift a between these two stimulated senses as a swift action each round.  When feeling light they are immune to gaze attacks.  Because of their different ways of perceiving things, they gain a +4 circumstance bonus to all perception checks.  Effects that confuse the senses, still confuses a Kamerel normally.  They can also use this ability to eliminate blindness and deafness, such as by seeing sound or hearing light.  Though when using their senses in this way, they can’t use their bonuses.</p>

SPECIAL ABILITIES<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Blinding Ray (Sp)</span> 9/day - Touch Attack (+8) within 30 feet, creatures lower than 5 HD are blinded for 1 round, creatures higher than 5 HD are dazed for 1 round.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Mirror Hop (Su)</span> As a move action, a Kamerel adjacent to a reflective surface or creature can teleport to any reflective surface or creature within 60 feet.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Mirror Walk (Su)</span> Kamerel can move through mirrored and reflective surfaces at will.  This functions much like <span style="font-style:italic">shadow walk</span>, except that they travel through the Plane of Mirrors.  As a standard action a kamerel touches a mirror, and can exit through any mirror within a mile or stay on the Plane of Mirrors if they choose.  If it’s a mirror or highly reflective surface it happens automatically, if it’s a slightly reflective surface such as glass or a still pool of water, they only have a 30% chance of success.  No matter what it entered through, it can only exit through a normal mirror.  If there are no mirrors within 1 mile, they remain on the Plane of Mirrors instead, and must exit through an actual mirror portal in some random location.  Since Kamerel are tied to the Plane of Mirrors, they produce no mirror duplicates on that plane.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Scry Mirror (Su)</span> At will a kamerel looking through a mirror can see what’s in front of any other mirror within a mile, for as long as they concentrate and stare at it.  They may not cast spells or attack through the mirrors they are looking through.  Unlike their mirror walk ability they must do this through an actual mirror, and can’t use reflective surfaces.  Otherwise this ability functions a lot like <span style="font-style:italic">clairaudience/clairvoyance</span>.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Spatial mirror (Su)</span> Given a few months depending on the size of the mirror, a kamerel can create the space behind a mirror real.  If it’s in a room it’s effectively the size of the room it duplicates.  If it’s outside it duplicates a 100 foot cube in front of the mirror.  Should the kamerel use this on mirrors facing mirrors, they create multiple duplicate spaces, perhaps even infinite numbers if they try enough.  This space behind the mirror is part of the plane it was created on, but a kamerel inside it can use the space to access the Plane of Mirrors using mirror walk, where they don’t even need to touch a reflective surface. <br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Synthesete (Ex)</span> Kamerel can shift their sensory input through to other senses.  Such as feel light or sound, they can shift a between these two stimulated senses as a swift action each round.  When feeling light they are immune to gaze attacks.  Because of their different ways of perceiving things, they gain a +4 circumstance bonus to all perception checks.  Effects that confuse the senses, still confuses a Kamerel normally.  They can also use this ability to eliminate blindness and deafness, such as by seeing sound or hearing light.  Though when using their senses in this way, they can’t use their bonuses.</p>

<p>The ancient race known as the kamerel were originally from the Outlands, they lived their eons before the Rilmani became the dominant race.  The kamerel were quite a neutral race in that they quite to themselves mostly, they barely acknowledged the existence of other races, until they started bothering them.  Soon they grew to be xenophobic.  The kamerel had a knack for the magic of mirrors which they were able to utilize as low level magic effects, allowing them to use such magic so close to the spire.  When they became aware of other races, they used this magic to spy on them.  </p>

<p>Eventually one kamerel name Hallanoc used her mirror magic to create a library which contained the copies of any book written in the multiverse.  Her race hated her for that and saw to it that she was executed, and named this mirrored library Timaresh because they hated what it represented.  However the Rilmani noticed the existence of this library and its value, and took it for themselves.  Soon this lead to an all out war, where the kamerel were overwhelmed as war with another race was inconceivable to them.</p>

<p>The kamerel now reside in the Plane of Mirrors, where they live out a nomadic tribal existence, as refugees after all these years.  From the Plane of Mirrors they watch other planes and wait, for the time when they get the best opportunity to take back what they lost since their retreat.  While there are other forms of life on the Plane of Mirrors to support them, the kamerel do raid other planes for supplies and food occasionally.  It’s not quite known exactly what the nature of their relationship to the even more enigmatic nerra is.  It’s thought that they have some sort of alliance or live as subjects of the nerra rulers.  However some sages theorize that many of the kamerel have become the nerra after years of living on the Plane of Mirrors, as the nerra seem to be a relatively new race, with no ancient accounts of their existence from when the kamerel lived on the Outlands.  Other sages theorize that the kamerel are somehow related to the ancestors of many humanoid races such as humans and halflings, from times lost to history.  </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Strategies and Tactics</span><br />
The kamerel prefer to use hit and run tactics, emerging from a mirror and returning back to the plane of mirrors quickly.  In such assaults they are usually quite prepared as they’ve managed to scry ahead of time.  Before such assaults, if they are capable of using mirror image, they will.  Kamerel assault groups often come with sergeants known as drivers, who usually prepare for such ambushes with spells such as darkness.  They are also found of using traps, such as using summoned monsters from the Plane of Mirrors, and directing them through the mirror portals to attack what’s on the other side.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sample Encounters<br />
Kamerel raiding party (EL 7):</span> This kamerel assault team consists of 6 kamerel, lead by 2 drivers.  They emerge from a nearby mirror, using their best ambush tactics.  This raiding party may also include 3 varoot nerra or 1 kalereem nerra, raising the EL to 8.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I did this using the help of the DDI's Monster Builder, it's useful though it has it's problems mainly it uses the dying technology of Silverlight, and exports monsters into an XML file with no option for saving as just plain text.</p>

<p>Maybe not the best designed 4e monster, as it may have a lot of things for such a low-level monster, but then it was a 2e monster converted to 3.5e and then to Pathfinder, before being plugged in as a 4e monster.  I think the monster tool at least sets the bonuses hit points and damage to something that's typical of monster type and level.</p>

          Re: Using the Mirror Plane (now with Kamerel stats)        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>I guess what else this stat block needs is a lore section, which should be fine as something that's easily dual stat.  As long as it's better than Cave Bear lore at least.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Kamerel Lore</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Arcana/Knowledge(Arcana) 18</span> Looking into a mirror in the corner of your eye, you may for just a second see the glimpse of a being watching you.  Mirrors are like windows to these elusive creatures, that lurk behind them spying on anything that may be in view of a mirror.  If something goes missing near a mirror, perhaps it can be blamed on one of these creatures.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Arcana/Knowledge(Arcana) 23</span> These humanoid creatures are known as the Kamerel, an ancient race of nomads who eke out their existence raiding other planes.  They are a xenophobic people from the Plane of Mirrors, where they exist with other beings such as the Nerra.  It's said that the Kamerel once belonged to the Outlands before being exiled by the Rilmani.  As a result of living in the Plane of Mirrors, Kamerel have developed a specialized form of magic known as Mirror Magic.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Arcana/Knowledge(Arcana) 33</span> The Kamerel were once exemplars of certain philosophies and morals, in which the way beings such as Yugoloths, Tanar'i and Rilmani were.  They represented neutrality as a reclusive race that kept to themselves, before the more agressive and interventionist Rilmani drove them from the Outlands.  It's said that the ancestry of some humanoid races might be traced back to the Kamerel.  And there are rumours that some people across the planes may be touched by Kamerel ancestry among their bloodlines, as occasionally they are said to place changeling children among humanoid races.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Arcana/Knowledge(Arcana) 38</span> One of the Kamerel was very curious of what the other races across the planes had for their culture and desires.  She was known as Hallanoc, who devised a mighty ritual using her mirror magic to create a library which contained the copies of any book written in the multiverse. The Kamerel hated her for that and saw to it that she was slain and her name forever scorned, and named this mirrored library Timaresh who's very existence they cursed.  The Rilmani discovered the existence of this library and its value, and seized it for themselves. When the Rilmani came, the Kamerel were overwhelmed as war with another race was inconceivable to them, and they were forced to seek refuge in the Plane of Mirrors or face destruction at the hands of their invaders.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Got a little homebrew monster for you. Been ages since I futzed with stats, so a proper statblock will have to wait til I have some time free.</p>

<p>The Solip<br />
In the plane of Mirrors there exists a creature that may at first look like a man or woman staring into a full-length mirror. However, a closer examination will show that there is no mirror at all. The figure and its reflection are actually one being: a Solip. Solips have no faces. Their opposite heads are joined at the temples and chins and their hands have merged at the palms so that five double-fingers point outward to each side. From these hands emanate a pair of reflective blades.</p>

<p>The Solip's mirrored "halves" can resemble a variety of mortal races with a wide range of body-types, skin-tones, and hairstyles, but often seem vaguely familiar to onlookers. They are usually between four and seven feet tall are always completely naked. They move by shuffling their two sets of legs sideways in a crabwalk, so that they lead with their blade and their strange double-eared heads. The Solip dwell in isolated halls and passageways within Mirror. They never eat, drink, breathe, or rest, and are always seen alone. They are not innately aggressive, but they will guard their territories with deadly zeal.</p>

<p>Despite their awkward shape, the Solip are capable of surprising bursts of speed. They fight by first charging an enemy with one of their blades and then spin their bodies around quickly so that the blade on their other side can attack as well. They have no eyes, noses, or mouths, but their four ears seem to allow them to fight by sound alone, provided their opponents aren't incredibly light on their feet. The reflections from their spinning blades makes it difficult to look at them, so anyone attacking a Solip must make a saving throw or be [stunned/dazzled not sure on the DC]. Their greatest strength in combat though is their ability to regenerate. Wounds -- even seemingly mortal ones -- dealt to only one half of the Solip will not slow it down so long as the other half yet lives and will heal quickly [probably just basic rejeneration sort of like a troll or a hydra]. The only sure way to kill a Solip is to sever its head at the necks. </p>

<p>Even most graybeards know very little about the Solip. The Kamerel view them as cursed and avoid them at all costs, but do not discuss the reasons with Outsiders. The Nerra believe they exist to guard important or sacred places but keep their distance out of reverence or simple fear. The Solip themselves do not speak or acknowledge outsiders save through violence, so any answers they know they keep to themselves. Some say that the Solip are the remains of spirits that were trapped in Mirror milenia ago, while others suggest they are the souls of narcissist who blinded themselves to the rest of the Multiverse. </p>

<p>One sigilian legend tells of Fivitis the Godsman who hauled a full-length mirror everywhere he went and, when asked, insisted it contained the multiverse. He gazed into the mirror every chance he got and sometimes prayed to his own reflection as if it were a great idol.  When Fivitis died he was entombed facing the mirror. They say his spirit left his body, but became entranced by the Multiverse promised on the other side. Fivitis' spirit traveled through the mirror to the realm his faith had created beyond. But while Fivitis' faith was strong, his imagination was dull and all Fivitis knew was himself, so that when his spirit passed through the mirror it entered a realm shaped exactly like Fivitis and lost itself there. They say Fivitis' soul became the first Solip: blind to the world and doomed forever to see only what lay behind his own eyes.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Yeah I think Fivitis fits the Signers better than the Godsmen now that I think about it, but the two always were pretty similar. Anyway, Fivitis is too ancient to belong to the Mind's Eye, but modern members may well revere him. In case it wasn't clear, "solip" comes from "solipsist" -- someone who believes they're the only "real" thing in the universe. They're sort of the lost souls of Mirror.</p>

<p>I came up with the Solip because I thought Mirror needed more monsters. They're basically designed to fit the lone boss monster role like a manticore or giant would in a terrestrial campaign. Someone might send the players to "slay the Solip" or they might have to fight one to escape Mirror, but players still probably won't see more than one the whole time they're in Mirror.</p>

<p>More Mirror features:<br />
Mirrorsquitos (name subject to change):  Whizzing parasites that look like flying glass shards. They ignore wayward mortals, but will enter the mirrors around them and drain blood from their reflections. Having your reflection drained of blood won't hurt you, but watching someone who looks just like you be driven mad by flesh-hungry flies can be quite unsettling. That said, Mirrorsquitos have the useful trait of being able to recognize (and attack) mirror Simulacrum instantly. The Kamarel are said to have created the Mirrorsquito as a way of rooting out Nerra imposters, and swarms of the vicious little things are common around Kamarel communities. In addition, many travelers to Mirror keep a jar of Mirrorsquitos handy just in case one of their companions suddenly becomes left-handed.</p>

<p>False Halls<br />
The Kamarel guard their sacred places by using magic to warp the Mirrors around them and hide the real shrine in an endless sea of duplicates. Outsiders have never been able to enter the Kamarel's true sanctuaries, but they have seen the decoys, the reflections called "False Hall." A False Hall is a huge chamber shaped like an upside down funnel. The smooth mirrored walls are cylindrical but grow narrower and narrower the higher they go so that they converge around a sort of tube of infinite reflections. These tubes in the ceiling carry the glimmering reflections and ghostly echoes of the Kamarel religious rites from their hidden sanctuary to an unknown number of False Halls scattered all over Mirror. Those who visit a False Hall at an auspicious time, might catch glimpses of secret rituals, or hear powerful words in the language of mirrors, but such eavesdropping is never without risk. To punish those who would try to steal Kamarel secrets, the False Halls are filled with dangerous traps, and insidious enchantments, and many are filled with the remains (and sometimes souls) of previous careless travelers.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Exploring the Plane of Mirrors</span><br />
An essay by Johanna Goradsdottir of the Fraternity of Order.</p>

<p>The nature of the Plane of Mirror has long perplexed the sages of our noble Order. Is it a demiplane or full plane? An inner plane or outer plane? Its seeming resistance to the neat categories we have drawn up to explain the multiverse has frustrated countless generations of scholars. Until the successful expedition to the hidden rilmani library of Timaresh during the Iron Shadow plague a few scant years ago, no extensive exploration of the plane had happened at all - information was limited to a few conjured sub-planes such as those created by the <span style="font-style:italic">mirror of entrapment</span>. Since then, however, a considerable amount of information has come to light, thanks to the discovery of the Starry Mirror on Oerth, the opening of the city of Silvergate, and the recovery of the <span style="font-style:italic">Book of Flesh and Mirrors</span> from Azzagrat. </p>

<p>But first, it behooves us to examine in more detail the various theories of the Mirror Plane's nature.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">A demiplane</span>. It's the natural first instinct of any planologist, when trying to fit an otherwise anomalous plane into the cosmology, to assume it must be some kind of demiplane. The demiplanes of the Deep Ethereal are so varied that they may have virtually any imaginable topography, so chances are if a given plane <span style="font-style:italic">isn't</span> a demiplane, there is still probably a demiplane somewhere that precisely resembles it.</p>

<p>Even so, there are grave problems with this theory. The Plane of Mirrors touches both the Inner Planes and the Outer Planes as well as the Prime Material, whereas an ethereal demiplane would only touch the Inner Planes and the Prime. Nearly all demiplanes have Border Ethereal aspects and a distinct curtain in the Deep Ethereal Plane, while the Plane of Mirrors apparently has neither; no magic that accesses the Ethereal Plane has been made to work within the Plane of Mirrors. If the plane is a demiplane, then, it seems to be one that has been pulled away from the Ethereal Plane that spawned it and become ensconced deep within the multiversal substrate, touching all known planes equally.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">An Inner Plane</span>. Just as some cartographers number the Inner Planes as only six rather than the more typical eighteen, considering the quasi- and paraelemental planes as mere border regions of the primary six, some theorists go further and count the borders of the quasielemental and paraelemental planes as planes in their own right. Proposed additional planes include Pumice, Crystal, Clay, Frost, Acid, Fumes, Silt, Obsidian, Sun, Rain, and the Plain of Burning Skies, and some of these theorists also claim the Plane of Mirrors exists as the border between the pure light of the Positive Energy Plane and either Mineral, Obsidian, or Crystal. Mainstream scholars count all three of the latter planes as regions within the same Quasielemental Plane of Mineral, of course, and naturally that plane contains so many reflective surfaces that access to the Plane of Mirrors is more prevalent than anywhere else in the multiverse, but it has never been confirmed that the Plane of Mirrors is actually part of the structure of the Inner Planes. The same problems with the demiplane theory apply here: the Plane of Mirrors has no ethereal border, and it touches the Outer Planes as easily as it does the Inner.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">An Astral planetoid</span>. This theory is newer, and its chief proponent, the explorer Nils Mokoto, claims that the nerras themselves told him that their homeland is a perfect sphere composed of mirrorlike crystal somewhere in the Astral Plane. The Plane of Mirrors, that most planewalkers see, according to Mokoto, is only a series of extradimensional pathways, or perhaps tentacles, that the planetoid extrudes into other planes of existence. This theory is, of yet, impossible to confirm or refute, but it would seem to mesh poorly with the plane's observed properties, and it does nothing to explain how an Astral planetoid could manifest extradimensional pathways of such multiverse-spanning extent.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">A full plane</span>. It is also possible that the Plane of Mirrors is a plane in its own right. Perhaps shortly after light first formed in the newborn multiverse, it reflected off the primal waters of precreation, and in that moment the Plane of Mirrors came into being. The Plane of Mirrors has been compared to the Plane of Shadow in that it seems closely tied to the nature of light, and it may serve a similar role as a plane that joins every possible reality that has some degree of light in it. Like the Plane of Shadow, it may also have begun its existence as a demiplane and only later bloomed into something greater. Where such a plane might fit into the common maps of the multiverse is difficult to say - it seems to behave as a complex maze of smaller planes that connect to the other planes of existence in a haphazard fashion, behaving as if either it has no pattern or the rest of the multiverse lacks the order generally ascribed to it.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">A brief tour of the Plane of Mirrors</span><br />
A description of the known realms of the plane seems to be in order at this point.</p>

<p>Every known journey into the Plane of Mirrors begins with a mirror pane. Certain magics, for example the  <span style="font-style:italic">mirrowalk</span> spell found in the <span style="font-style:italic">Book of Flesh and Mirrors</span>, transform a mirror into a portal to the Mirror Plane. Planewalkers who cross the threshold of the tain of the mirror will find, initially, a room that looks identical to that which they left, but reversed. This copied area ends abruptly beyond where the mirror can see, the features of the room becoming increasingly less detailed until it becomes a hall of pure reflective glass extending toward the "other sides" of other mirrors - each mirror is linked to a random number of other ones in what are termed "constellations." </p>

<p>In cases where the mirror is a natural surface, such as a still pond or a reflective crystal on the Quasielemental Plane of Mineral, the mirrored equivalent will resemble that natural surface. Mirror-rooms that reflect outdoor ponds may be vast voids resembling the open sky, with hints of a muddy bottom and faintly shining translucent fish.</p>

<p>There is no known way to travel from one constellation to another other than to cross outside of the Plane of Mirrors and find another mirror that leads to a different constellation, although it is believed the nerras may have means that other races have not discovered. Labyrinthine maps of various constellations have been made, but no one apart from the nerras and perhaps the kamarel has mapped them all.</p>

<p>There is some connection between the mirror plane and what are normally termed "alternate material planes," "alternate cosmologies," or "alternate timelines," places where things are subtly different than they are in the planes we know. A given constellation may offer a direct path to a "mirror universe" in which resembles a traveler's plane of origin in every respect except good and evil, or law and chaos, or both have been altered or reversed. Even when a clear path is not evident, "mirror-duplicates" from such universes somehow show up in the halls of the constellation, searching to find and replace their doubles. It seems evident that the Plane of Mirrors does not create these beings, because they have vivid memories of their lives on parallel worlds. Typically they have no way back to their homes, though, forcing them to kill their doubles if they are to have any lives similar to the ones they knew. The nerras somehow always know the paths to these realms, and actively recruit or abduct parallel versions of mortals they wish to control. </p>

<p>If the mirror plane copies magical items visible in the mirror, these will normally be nonmagical, unless a nerra deliberately locates a parallel version of a magic item and leaves it in the mirror plane as bait or for some other reason of its own. Researchers attempting to use the mirror plane to create, say, a benevolent version of the <span style="font-style:italic">Hand of Vecna</span> or a noncursed version of a cursed sword are likely to be sorely disappointed. </p>

<p>If the mirror plane copies living beings who are visible in the mirror, things can become very weird. The copy will look identical to that portion of its reflection that is visible in the mirror, while those portions of its body that are not visible may have disturbingly blank or formless features, or may not exist at all. The Plane of Mirrors is full of creatures resembling severed hands, fluttering like bony pigeons or skittering about like spiders, or creatures resembling parts of heads and faces rolling about like vermin. If the mirror is curved, the creatures may look even stranger. Since the expedition to Timaresh, scholars have come to believe these tormented, distorted creatures are the descendants of the <span style="font-style:italic">kamarel</span>, natives of the Outlands who fled the Mirrored Library of Timaresh when it was conquered by the rilmani, escaping into the Plane of Mirrors and becoming lost and trapped. Unlike the nerras, who are masters of the plane, the kamarel have no control over any aspect of the plane and no ability to escape it. They have become slaves to all who peer into mirrors, forced to mirror any sentient being who gazes into its own reflection, taking the form of whatever portion of the viewer's body is visible in the glass. Their only possible escape is through the mirror in Timaresh through which they originally entered, and this they regard as impossible as long as the rilmani remain in control of the library. They retain these forms until someone gazes at the glass again, and as a result the plane has become infested with mindless copies of disembodied body parts, horrors who roam the plane, searching for those who can release them. Some scholars believe it is the kamarel who become the mirror-duplicates that plague the plane in those cases when an actual portal to a mirror-universe isn't present, and their memories of other worlds are simply illusions.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Silvergate</span><br />
Located deep within the plane, Silvergate is both a trading-town and a prison. Long ago, an unknown civilization banished many of its criminals into the Plane of Mirrors, leaving them in what appears to be a great cavern with mirrored walls. Where this cavern might be located within the multiverse is anyone's guess; it has no apparent connection with either the Ethereal or the Astral Plane. Over the centuries, the inhabitants of Silvergate have built themselves a city from the flotsom and jetsom available to them, and they have interbred with exiles and planewalkers from countless other worlds, so that the typical native of the city resembles a hybrid of dozens of different species. What their original race was is a matter of speculation - some even think they were kamarel. Only recently, thanks to help of a mysterious wizard who has become the town's ruler, have the Gatians (as they are known) gained access to the <span style="font-style:italic">mirrorwalk</span> spells they need to access other constellations and thus find a way out. Suddenly they have gone from being a prison worse than Curst to a trading town that may someday rival Sigil itself, though the average Gatians cannot afford the spell needed to travel to other worlds on their own, as the spellcasters who know the requisite magic charge them dearly. Maps through known constellations leading through the winding corridors of the mirror-planes to Silvergate have gained increasingly wide circulation, however, and they are commonly available for purchase from the mercanes, the Planar Trade Consortium, or the Planewalker's Guild. </p>

<p>Silvergate is a nexus of not only many different planes and worlds, but of many parallel cosmologies. It is a neutral zone where travelers and their mirror-duplicates are forced to live together in peace, and thus a welcome respite from the rest of the plane. It is perhaps the one place on the Plane of Mirrors where the nerras are not the ultimate masters, though they occasionally come to Silvergate to trade like everyone else. The master of Silvergate, a mysterious mirrormasked figure known as the Lord of Mirrors, uses his considerable mystical power to keep the factions of the city under control and prevent outsiders from conquering it.</p>

<p>(<span style="font-style:italic">Silvergate is detailed in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Seven Civilizations</span> from Atlas Games.</span>)</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">The Constellation of Eyes</span><br />
The Constellation of Eyes is the fabled homeworld of the nerras, the center of all mirrors. This is said to be an entire planet made up of a reflective material, around which orbit vast mirrors through which the nerras can observe countless worlds. Some believe that every constellation has a secret path to the Constellation of Eyes, while others say the nerras have merely become very, very knowledgeable of the mirrored routes, so that they can reliably find their way home from virtually any place that has a mirror in it. Regardless, the nerras keep the routes to their homeland a carefully guarded secret; it is possible that those races who have become their allies, such as the spell weavers, ethergaunts, and tsnng, also know the way to the Constellation of Eyes, but if so they are not sharing this knowledge with others. </p>

<p>The origin of the nerras is likewise disputed. Some believe the spell weavers created them, while others  believe they were a breakaway faction of tsnng. One legend claims they were an ancient race of benevolent sorcerers who became partly corrupted by Asmodeus, eventually turning to pure neutrality rather than allying with either good or evil. Some believe the nerras created the Plane of Mirrors, while others believe they merely expanded it, and still others believe they merely learned to master it. </p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">(The Constellation of Eyes is described briefly in the 4th edition <span style="text-decoration:underline">Monster Manual 3.</span>)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Mirror mephits</span><br />
Finally, a word about mirror mephits. Like other mephits, these are artificially-created beings originally created as servants, probably by the nerras in this case, but like the mephits of the Inner Planes the mirror mephits soon figured out how to create more of their kind on their own and ran wild. Now they are common pests on their plane, haunting the many tunnels and byways of the constellations as well as the Constellation of Eyes and Silvergate. No one but other mirror mephits craves their company, but as they are too numerous to do away with and impossible to create mirror-duplicates of, most have learned to at least tolerate their presence. They act as spies, messengers, saboteurs, and scavengers when not hatching schemes of their own.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">(Mirror mephits appear in <span style="text-decoration:underline">Expedition to the Demonweb Pits</span>.)</span></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Hey Rip, great stuff! Personally I always liked the description of Mirror as a "pseudo-plane" like Shadow, Dream, and (maybe) Time. As you pointed out it's got a lot in common with Shadow and you could probably make a case for the two being different layers or "sides" of the same plane. After all, a mirror is just a window with light on one side and shadow on the other.</p>

<p>One other thing, your description of the Kamarel as tortured lost souls doesn't seem to match other descriptions of them being masters of Mirror Magic and the plane itself, and as for the Nerra, I can't find anything on them at all. Were they added in 3e? I read a lot of the Shattered Mirror stuff people were working on a couple years back, but it's been ages since I cracked <span style="font-style:italic">Infinite Staircase</span> and I'm having trouble remembering what's actually canon.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">
