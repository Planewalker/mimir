</div> <p>OK, some major changes here, but I hope you'll agree that they're all for the better. Any comments and suggestions are welcome</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">ECOTOPIA OF THE BEASTLANDS</span></p>

<p>(BETTER WRITTEN, MORE INTERESTING, AND MORE APPROPRIATE HISTORY PENDING)</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">BEASTLANDS TRAITS</span><br />
Normal Gravity<br />
Normal Time<br />
Infinite Size<br />
Divinely Morphic<br />
No Elemental or Energy Traits<br />
Mildly Good-Aligned<br />
Normal Magic</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">BEASTLANDS INHABITANTS</span></p>

<p>(HAVE AN IDEA BUT I JUST NEED TO WRITE IT)</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">FEATURES OF THE BEASTLANDS</span></p>

<p>	The Beastlands has four layers, Krigala, a layer of ruins of ancient cities, Brux, where all things are alive contains a spirit, Karasuthra, a testing ground for the ultimate survivalist and Volox, a surreal world of introspection and self-discovery. Unlike the Beastland's previous incarnation, each layer gets equal amount of daylight and nighttime, except for Volox, which is always shrouded in darkness.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Krigala</span></p>

<p>Krigala is nicknamed the "graveyard of civilization" as it is covered with a ruined city of leviathan proportions. The city has no real order to it, toppled skyscrapers lie mangled between industrial-era slums and tenements and old medieval cathedrals. In most places the city is eerily quiet yet strangely beautiful and chaotic, vines and trees grow easily here and sometimes the ruins are indiscernable from a forest. Usually the only sounds are birds chirping and slight breezes. In fact, the ruins are made up of every city that has ever been destroyed in the Prime Material Plane.</p>

<p>The petitioners here look as were when they were adolescents. Although they act much like children and play childish games they are as intelligent as they were in life. They can be uncannily wise, and have a great gift of pointing out character flaws to those who deny having them. They have no interest in argument, but will play games whom whoever wants. Often these games will result in strange relevations and odd suggestions. Few know that these petitioners are the spirits of good-aligned revolutionaries.</p>

<p>Others live here too, the ruins are all-accepting, there is no concept of squatting or ownership of land. Much of Krigala's population is made up of clueless, angry and bitter at their treatment from the rest of the planes, or those so pathetic and estranged Krigala is the only place that will take them. These communities can show a suprising amount of sophistication, some have electrical generators and utilize the old sewage system.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Anarchoburg</span></p>

<p>The biggest settlement in the Beastlands in Anarchoburg, with a population of almost a hundred thousand. It has nothing with the anarchist faction, but rather the lack of a consistant power structure. Ideas are the currency of Anarchoburg (sometimes literally), and the residents are constantly reorganizing and trying out new "methods". Argument and a debate are the main pastimes, and it's hard to beat Anarchoburg passion. In Anarchoburg, revolution is an every-day activity, and visitors are encouraged to overthrow their own governments.<br />
Anarchoburg has a port on the river Oceanus, and gets regular traffic from the rest of the planes.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Student University</span></p>

<p>One of the most prestigious universities in the planes is also the most disorganized. Student University, as it is oddly called, is built within a massive royal palace which was razed to the ground on the Prime Material Plane. It is entirely run by students, even the faculty are also students, attendance is universal and free. Anyone can become a professor, but only the best professors become popular. Schedules are pretty irregular and usually only held together by serendipity (which is actually pretty common around SU). The science department is notoriously adventurous, doing experiments only fully-equipped military-grade labs would dare. Just don't volunteer yourself to be a test subject!</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Brux</span></p>

<p>Brux looks almost identical to an undeveloped prime world, except with a stranger sense of beauty. Although the vast majority of it is covered with forest, it does roll out into endless savannas and prairies, spotted with mountain ranges, glaciers, and tundra. It is here where animals roam provided with plenty by the layer itself.</p>

<p>The climate here is odd for one of the upper planes. The weather is not known for it's calmness. In fact, thunder and rain can rage suddenly, but this is considered good luck. Visitors are encouraged to "enjoy the rain" for a few minutes.</p>

<p>What few people realize is that everything is alive and has a spirit in Brux. The rocks, the trees, the wind and the mountains all can see and hear what is around them, and think as well as humans. Those armed with the appropriate druidic magic can speak to them and learn from them or make requests. Most of these beings are truly ancient and have seen some things or two. Some people say, though, if they close their eyes and listen very closely, they can hear them without magic.</p>

<p>Many of the more friendly Animal Lords live here. Those of Deer, Birds, and Squirrels find this plane pleasant, although the prankster Fox Lord does spend some time here.</p>

<p>Anyone who lives here lives in harmony with nature. Those that refuse to are in for some hard luck, the living earth itself will shake whatever they build to the ground. Visitors with obvious evil intention are spotted immediately, there are eyes all around. All in all, Brux is pretty good at defending itself.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Ehlonna's Grove</span><br />
Ehlonna's redwood cathedral hasn't changed much in the course of millenia. Her realm is a place of peace and harmony, no violence is allowed, even animals know they are in a Goddess's sanctuary. Vistors do come here sometimes to enjoy the placid animals, but most find the occasion somewhat saccharine, feeling like they've disappeared into some children's film. Ehlonna is getting more secluded and rarely meets people, although remarkable mortals are invited to her cathedral as well as any worshipers she still has. Ehlonna's seclusion is tabloid fodder for most of the planes.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Skerrit's Realm</span><br />
Skerrit's realm is actually nomadic, traveling from place to place with his tribe. Here, they enjoy a life of constant adventure and travel, one that a centaur is suited towards. When they stop, they erect brightly colored tents painted with primitive yet beautiful patterns. Skerrit has the tendency to see modern technology as a crutch and will not harbor it as of yet.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Karasuthra</span></p>

<p>	Unlike Brux, Karasuthra is not a place of harmony. Karasuthra is embroiled in struggle from which all those involved become stronger and wiser. It reminds some of the old plane of Ysgard, except on Karasuthra it serves a purpose to improve the combatants in mind and spirit.</p>

<p>	The inhabitants are tested by the environment and by other natives. Karasuthra is covered with humid jungles, volcanoes, and expansive deserts, combining the harshest terrains on the prime material into a patchwork layer. The natives are ancient and terrible beasts, dinosaurs, wolves, giant spider, snakes and other creatures you wouldn't expect too see on the upper planes.</p>

<p>	Despite the frightening nature of the animals here, they are teachers more than predators. Each one of them know a lesson, that the world is harsh, and to survive it is necessary to be cunning and strong. They live to pass the lesson onto visitors and to each other, that way, when a real trial comes to them they will survive.</p>

<p>	Visitors to the realm, or as the natives call them, "pilgrims", are here hunt, to study, and to survive. Those that are there to hunt are in for the ultimate test and will find the animals give little mercy. Others will be harried and taunted by the inhabitants, but will not be killed so long as they continue to struggle. Regular visitors will find that the plane gives respite to those who persevere.</p>

<p>	The only permanent human inhabitants are petitioners, those who were in life teachers of battle or those who struggled and survived themselves. Occasionally, survivalists do come down to this layer and eke out a challenging existence.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Red Sands Research Facility</span><br />
	Not long ago and independent company called McDougall-Sanders Inc (actually owned by yugoloths) built an underground research facility in a red desert. Activities were kept heavily under wraps, but animals were mysteriously disappearing wholesale from jungles, and it was suspected that the lab was developing strange biological weapons using local wildlife.</p>

<p>	Unfortunately for the yugoloths, some of their "experiments" broke out of their cages and ripped the facility to shreds. Scientists fled to the jungles, only to be greeted by very angry natives. Their experiments were abominations, strange amalgamations of animals melded together and enchanted with magic to make mad and ferocious other-beasts. The vile creatures hide in the ruins, afraid to leave for fear of their kin.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Volox</span></p>

<p>Volox, the most remote layer of the Beastlands, is a place of weirdness and mystery. Only accessible through Karasuthra's volcanic vents, Volox is a surreal nether-world in which sea and air impossibly intermix.</p>

<p>A dark blue fog pervades the entire layer, like an eternally cloudy night. The only real sources of light are the volcanic streams of lava which weave their way through the earth. Alien birds and sea-creatures unseen in the Prime Material Plane fly and swim alongside each other in the mist.</p>

<p>There are no petitioners here. Travelers rarely come down here. Hunters are rarely ever successful, since the creatures can instantly see evil intent and run. When they are successful, the meat dissolves into oil in their mouths and the carcasses decay quickly outside of the native environment, live specimens will waste away. There is nothing to do here except introspection.</p>

<p>A number of mysteries exist here. Where do the animals come from? How can Volox be an ocean and a sky? What's the blue mist? What's the point of Volox? Investigators routinely turn up with nothing. However, people who float in Volox's cool air with eyes closed and an open heart will find that their souls are laid bare. In the unfamiliar environment, the soul is the familiar thing, and their darkest, most hidden desires and fears will reveal themselves.</p>

<p>After such traumatic introspection, the selfish will become selfless, the conservative will become liberal, the content will burn with passion, the destroyers will rebuild. Volox doesn't give magic power or make one tough and powerful. In Volox, the greatest revolution is the one inside the heart.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">The Vents</span><br />
Intrepid characters can dive deeper into the volcanic under-earth of Volox. It requires serious magical protection, but some think that there's some kind of metaphysical treasure in the magma-filled tunnels. Most berks are rewarded with a one-way ticket to the planes of fire or magma, or just a fiery death.</p>       </div>

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>I like your treatment of the Beastlands.  Unfortunately, I have a problem with the Beastlands in general.  My problem is that it doesn't fit.</p>

<p>Although it falls into the Chaotic/Neutral Good slot, the plane as it is described is actually True Neutral.  The Animal Lords, for example, are neutral.  So are the petitioners that live here.  The assumption that the Beastlands is a natural sanctuary leads one to conclude that all aspects of nature are included, including those used to personify evil (spiders, hyenas, vultures, poisonous snakes, etc.)  While nature has been venerated, it's also been feared.  The best example I can think of is Joseph Conrad's "Heart of Darkness".  Even your description of a Modern Beastlands betrays that it doesn't really belong where it should on the Great Wheel.  The Primes who settled the Beastlands weren't just vacationing yuppies, big game hunters, and logging executives, but (using our own experience with deforestation) working class poor who have no other hope of improving their lot.  Should they be forced to return to the urban slums they left behind?</p>

<p>These are tough questions, and I feel that the Beastlands oversimplifies them by embracing the nature theme to a totality.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I do agree that it's a tad bit dark, and I'll go over it and make it "nicer".</p>

<p>But the Beastlands have always been a bit darker and more dangerous. It's a place of beasts, not fuzzy wuzzy bunnies (though they most certainly exist in the Beastlands). Being a plane of Good didn't keep it from being essentially Darwinian, and that means it should give all creatures a chance, even those that "personify" evil like spiders and snakes, who only kill to eat and defend themselves.</p>

<p>If the Beastlands become urbanized, where are the animals going to go? Civilization has the rest of the planes, the animals have just one plane. Would a "good" person stand aside and allow that to happen? Let's say they negotiated and the deals were refused. Would the Beastlands just have to hope for the best?</p>

<p>The Beastlands isn't any eviler than before, it is simply reacting to a threat and defending a population which deserves defending. The Beastlands, as I take it, isn't a sandbox for the rest of the planes. Allowing  civilization to intrude on the last vestiges of pure nature wouldn't be good at all, it would be cowardly.</p>

<p>The only other way of writing the Beastlands up would be to make it "The National Park of the Beastlands". And I hope no one wants that.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I'm not saying that <span style="font-style:italic">your</span> take on the Beastlands is too dark, but that the Plane is too dark to begin with.  The other Planes on the Great Wheel all have wilderness areas-even Mechanus has neatly forested cogs-but they are balanced by civilized areas.  The Beastlands, however, is all wilderness, with civilization or even intelligent culture being unwelcome.  That seems out of place on the Great Wheel because culture is where beliefs are generated in the first place.  Surely, there must be beliefs that fit in the moral/ethical spectrum of the Beastlands that reflects civilized life?</p>

<p>Your assesment that "good" and "darwinian" are not exclusive may be correct, but it's not so much important that they not be exlusive so much that they be in agreement.  In the nests of some predatory birds, to give one example, one chick will kill or drive out its sibling in order to ensure it has enough food to survive.  Since it's a question of survival, that kind of behavior is okay on the Outlands-but the Upper Planes?</p>

<p>Of course, this discussion probably belongs on the main board, as the issue is with the Beastlands as it exists now.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>that take on the Beastlands is definitly a bit to dark and evil.</p>

<p>I like the dying civilization part, the hunters part, and the humans part.</p>

<p>petitioners should stay as they always were animals. so if a human dies and becomes a petitioner of the beastlands they are an animal not some freak. I think in 2nd they had such petitioners able to talk and definitly much smarter than normal animals. Hence making the game much more deadly.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Not necessarily. You're implying that culture can only exist in 'civilized' locations. The idea of a civilization can easily vary. Imagine how many 'primitive' civilizations are out there. The kind of semi-druidic peoples that live in peace with nature and belive that all animals have spirits. Like the native americans before all those white folks showed up. I can easily see a significant number of civilizations like that, on many differant prime worlds, who would have those beliefs and not advance in tech as fast. After all, if they live in peace with nature and have some druids in the mix, practically everything they might want is provided for. whats to improve upon, from their perspective at least. Enough of these group and you would have enough belief to keep the Beastlands going strong.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Don't worry, the Beastlands will always remain more bestial than civilized. Brux, Karasuthra and Volox will all remain pretty much the same. Krigala will get a slight facelift.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Not necessarily. You're implying that culture can only exist in 'civilized' locations. The idea of a civilization can easily vary. Imagine how many 'primitive' civilizations are out there.</div></p>

<p>Don't forget the beliefs of "cultured" people. Look at Greenpeace, the PETA, and a host of other environmental groups. All of these groups that have the desire to be closer and more at harmony with nature, even though they spring from civilization. On the other hand, there are civilized people that fit into the Beastlands not because they want to be close to nature but because their alignment has placed them there. I cannot ignore them either.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Each layer will represent a different metaphyisical facet of neutral good (chaotic).</p>

<p>Originally, these were the meanings of each layer.</p>

<p>Krigala: Dominance of nature over civilization.<br />
Brux: Nature at balance, the natural order.<br />
Karauthra: uh...dinosaurs  <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/tongue.png" title="Sticking out tongue" alt="Sticking out tongue" class="smiley-content"/> <br />

<p>...And the new meanings of each layer...</p>

<p>Krigala: Political revolution, rebirth, tolerance.<br />
Brux: Harmony with nature, concept of universal spirit and life in all things.<br />
Karasuthra: Struggle, individualism, spirit.<br />
Volox: Mysteriousness of nature, adventure, thrill of the unknown.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Krigala</span></p>

<p>Krigala is nicknamed the "graveyard of civilization" as it is covered with a ruined city of leviathan proportions. The city has no real order to it, toppled skyscrapers lie mangled between industrial-era slums and tenements and old medieval cathedrals. In most places the city is eerily quiet yet strangely beautiful and chaotic, vines and trees grow easily here and sometimes the ruins are indiscernable from a forest. Usually the only sounds are birds chirping and slight breezes. In fact, the ruins are made up of every city that has ever been destroyed in the Prime Material Plane.</p>

<p>The petitioners here look as were when they were adolescents. Although they act much like children and play childish games they are as intelligent as they were in life. They can be uncannily wise, and have a great gift of pointing out character flaws to those who deny having them. They have no interest in argument, but will play games whom whoever wants. Often these games will result in strange relevations and odd suggestions. Few know that these petitioners are the spirits of good-aligned revolutionaries.</p>

<p>Others live here too, the ruins are all-accepting, there is no concept of squatting or ownership of land. Much of Krigala's population is made up of clueless, angry and bitter at their treatment from the rest of the planes, or those so pathetic and estranged Krigala is the only place that will take them. These communities can show a suprising amount of sophistication, some have electrical generators and utilize the old sewage system.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Anarchoburg</span></p>

<p>The biggest settlement in the Beastlands in Anarchoburg, with a population of a few thousand. It has nothing with the anarchist faction, but rather the lack of a consistant power structure. Ideas are the currency of Anarchoburg (sometimes literally), and the residents are constantly reorganizing and trying out new "methods". Argument and a debate are the main pastimes, and it's hard to beat Anarchoburg passion. In Anarchoburg, revolution is an every-day activity, and visitors are encouraged to overthrow their own governments.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Student University</span></p>

<p>One of the most prestigious universities in the planes is also the most disorganized. Student University, as it is oddly called, is built within a massive royal palace which was razed to the ground on the Prime Material Plane. It is entirely run by students, even the faculty are also students, attendance is universal and free. Anyone can become a professor, but only the best professors become popular. Schedules are pretty irregular and usually only held together by serendipity (which is actually pretty common around SU). The science department is notoriously adventurous, doing experiments only fully-equipped military-grade labs would dare. Just don't volunteer yourself to be a test subject!</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>One rule for animal-petitioners I came up with-they go through a cycle of death and rebirth.  Each time they are reborn, they keep their memories from their previous lives.  Such petitioners develop an overall appreciation for the role the rest of the ecology, including predators, prey, and creatures that compete for the same resources.  They communicate this respect to visitors willing to come on the Plane's terms.</p>

<p>Also, the Animal Lords should be NG/CG, or else moved to the Outlands.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Perro: The old one was. The new Modern Beastlands will involve a lot of nature, to be sure, but will focus on alignment. As Throatbane pointed out, focus on nature to the exclusion of everything else is generally Neutral, not Chaotic Good. Therefore Nature will be a strong element in the new Beastlands, but not the only one.</p>

<p>I've considered changing the name of the Beastlands to something different, but the Beastlands are still "wild", in particular the last two layers.</p>

<p>Nick: Yes, the (rather small) administration is also run by students, and also there is no experience required to be a professor, which is very different from regular universities. So many students teach classes as well as attend, with the popular or reputable classes becoming the longest lived and most attended. I'll make sure this is clear next time I edit the entry.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Brux</span></p>

<p>	Brux looks almost identical to an undeveloped prime world, except with a stranger sense of beauty. Although the vast majority of it is covered with forest, it does roll out into endless savannas and prairies, spotted with mountain ranges, glaciers, and tundra. It is here where animals roam provided with plenty by the layer itself.</p>

<p>	The climate here is odd for one of the upper planes. The weather is not known for it's calmness. In fact, thunder and rain can rage suddenly, but this is considered good luck. Visitors are encouraged to "enjoy the rain" for a few minutes.</p>

<p>	What few people realize is that everything is alive and has a spirit in Brux. The rocks, the trees, the wind and the mountains all can see and hear what is around them, and think as well as humans. Those armed with the appropriate druidic magic can speak to them and learn from them or make requests. Most of these beings are truly ancient and have seen some things or two. Some people say, though, if they close their eyes and listen very closely, they can hear them without magic.</p>

<p>	Many of the more friendly Animal Lords live here. Those of Deer, Birds, and Squirrels find this plane pleasant, although the prankster Fox Lord does spend some time here.</p>

<p>	Anyone who lives here lives in harmony with nature. Those that refuse to are in for some hard luck, the living earth itself will shake whatever they build to the ground. Visitors with obvious evil intention are spotted immediately, there are eyes all around. All in all, Brux is pretty good at defending itself.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Ehlonna's Grove</span><br />
Ehlonna's redwood cathedral hasn't changed much in the course of millenia. Her realm is a place of peace and harmony, no violence is allowed, even animals know they are in a Goddess's sanctuary. Vistors do come here sometimes to enjoy the placid animals, but most find the occasion somewhat saccharine, feeling like they've disappeared into some children's film. Ehlonna is getting more secluded and rarely meets people, although remarkable mortals are invited to her cathedral as well as any worshipers she still has. Ehlonna's seclusion is tabloid fodder for most of the planes.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Skerrit's Realm</span><br />
Skerrit's realm is actually nomadic, traveling from place to place with his tribe. Here, they enjoy a life of constant adventure and travel, one that a centaur is suited towards. When they stop, they erect brightly colored tents painted with primitive yet beautiful patterns. Skerrit has the tendency to see modern technology as a crutch and will not harbor it as of yet.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Karasuthra</span></p>

<p>	Unlike Brux, Karasuthra is not a place of harmony. Karasuthra is embroiled in struggle from which all those involved become stronger and wiser. It reminds some of the old plane of Ysgard, except on Karasuthra it serves a purpose to improve the combatants in mind and spirit.</p>

<p>	The inhabitants are tested by the environment and by other natives. Karasuthra is covered with humid jungles, volcanoes, and expansive deserts, combining the harshest terrains on the prime material into a patchwork layer. The natives are ancient and terrible beasts, dinosaurs, wolves, giant spider, snakes and other creatures you wouldn't expect too see on the upper planes.</p>

<p>	Despite the frightening nature of the animals here, they are teachers more than predators. Each one of them know a lesson, that the world is harsh, and to survive it is necessary to be cunning and strong. They live to pass the lesson onto visitors and to each other, that way, when a real trial comes to them they will survive.</p>

<p>	Visitors to the realm, or as the natives call them, "pilgrims", are here hunt, to study, and to survive. Those that are there to hunt are in for the ultimate test and will find the animals give little mercy. Others will be harried and taunted by the inhabitants, but will not be killed so long as they continue to struggle. Regular visitors will find that the plane gives respite to those who persevere.</p>

<p>	The only permanent human inhabitants are petitioners, those who were in life teachers of battle or those who struggled and survived themselves. Occasionally, survivalists do come down to this layer and eke out a challenging existence.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Red Sands Research Facility</span><br />
	Not long ago and independent company called McDougall-Sanders Inc (actually owned by yugoloths) built an underground research facility in a red desert. Activities were kept heavily under wraps, but animals were mysteriously disappearing wholesale from jungles, and it was suspected that the lab was developing strange biological weapons using local wildlife.</p>

<p>	Unfortunately for the yugoloths, some of their "experiments" broke out of their cages and ripped the facility to shreds. Scientists fled to the jungles, only to be greeted by very angry natives. Their experiments were abominations, strange amalgamations of animals melded together and enchanted with magic to make mad and ferocious other-beasts. The vile creatures hide in the ruins, afraid to leave for fear of their kin.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Volox</span></p>

<p>	Volox, the bottom-most layer of the Beastlands, is a place of weirdness and mystery. Only accessible through Karasuthra's volcanic vents, Volox is a surreal nether-world in which sea and air impossibly intermix.</p>

<p>	A dark blue fog pervades the entire layer, like an eternally cloudy night. The only real sources of light are the volcanic streams of lava which weave their way through the earth. Alien birds and sea-creatures unseen in the Prime Material Plane fly and swim alongside each other in the mist.</p>

<p>	There are no petitioners here. Travelers rarely come down here. Hunters are rarely ever successful, since the creatures can instantly see evil intent and run. When they are successful, the meat dissolves into oil in their mouths and the carcasses decay quickly outside of the native environment, live specimens will waste away. There is nothing to do here except introspection.</p>

<p>	A number of mysteries exist here. Where do the animals come from? How can Volox be an ocean and a sky? What's the blue mist? What's the point of Volox? Investigators routinely turn up with nothing. However, people who float in Volox's cool air with eyes closed and an open heart will find that their souls are laid bare. In the unfamiliar environment, the soul is the familiar thing, and their darkest, most hidden desires and fears will reveal themselves.</p>

<p>	After such traumatic introspection, the selfish will become selfless, the conservative will become liberal, the content will burn with passion, the destroyers will rebuild. Volox doesn't give magic power or make one tough and powerful. In Volox, the greatest revolution is the one inside the heart.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">The Vents</span><br />
	Intrepid characters can dive deeper into the volcanic under-earth of Volox. It requires serious magical protection, but some think that there's some kind of metaphysical treasure in the magma-filled tunnels. Most berks are rewarded with a one-way ticket to the planes of fire or magma, or just a fiery death.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">
