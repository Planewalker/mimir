        <div class="dice_rolls">
</div> <p>In an effort to generate new ideas, I started to reconsider the planes not in terms of the "big" philosophical ideas but rather by pantheons and genres. </p>

<p>Some existing threads tied in other genres<br />
     Violet Dawn – Far Realms<br />
     Westerns – Outlands (if you like this combo suggested in that thread)</p>

<p>On other threads, I brought up the ideas of domains (or at least more details) for <br />
     (Indian) Rakshasa – thanks for all the feedback!<br />
     Egyptian afterlife</p>

<p>-So my general question is do you think there is a particular pantheon or genre that might deserve a special niche (or at least more detail)? <br />
-Can anyone recall some earlier threads that came up with some of these? (I’d like to consolidate some of these ideas for easier reference)<br />
-What elements make them appealing to you? <br />
-Also (if you have a preference), where do you think it would fit in to the planes?</p>

<p>I’m not asking for a dump of all the cultures one can think of. I’m asking for things that you find creatively inspiring. (E.g. yes, the Tartars have their own culture and myths; but unless their legends conjure up a lot of potential ideas/seeds/etc. then there is no need to mention it)<br />
Also, I don't think we need more than a short paragraph. If some idea really gets you excited and produces a lot of ideas, start a new thread and link it back to this page. That way, we can save this page for the "high level concepts" without getting bogged down in the minute details related to one specific idea.</p>

<p>For example: I find the beliefs of the Australian aborignal people to be very unique and somewhat evocative (not that I know nearly enough about it). The concepts of the Dreamtime world and its parallel (or intertwined) existance with our own could involve philosophical twists that would play well into Planescape</p>

<p>I also think the mythology of Central America (Mayan, Aztec, etc.) is very interesting and very under-represented in standard DnD. It’s a complex pantheon that covers a lot of unique portfolios. The gods are often depicted with a certain savageness that make them unique (yes, I realize a lot of that might be cultural bias from the reports of invading Euorpeans). Also, the idea of a sweltering jungle adventure to reach giant pyramids tickles my imagination.</p>       </div>

<p>I know how you feel, that's among the many mythologies on my "this looks interesting but I can't find any comprehensive books on it" list.<br />
Personally, I think the Dreamtime would mesh very well with the poor underdeveloped Beastlands, especially if you go with Rip's interpretation of the Beastlands <a href="forum/guardinals-beastlands-and-other-outsiders_.html#comment-57440">from over on this thread</a>:<br />

Might these work as the race of Hanuman and his monkey army (the vanara) from the Ramayana? It would help add another level of threat to the Rakshasa; if they'd annihilated an elder race of Good so thoroughly that the multiverse has nearly forgotten they ever existed!</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><span style="font-style:italic">Some existing threads tied in other genres<br />
Violet Dawn – Far Realms</span><br />
Actually, the Violet Dawn pantheon isn't from or related to the Far-Realm, though it might be possible that the head of the pantheon, Temulea, had contact with the Far Realm at one point *long after creating the other 15 Violet Dawn powers*, which served to inspire his design for the creatures of the Void.  For the most part however, Temulea's just an ass with an obsession for perfection who threw a literal temper tantrum when his perfectionist dreams for Avadnu were ruined by his 'rebellious' children.  His original placement probably would have been Mechanus, though eventually his divine realm might have slipped into Acheron.  He's currently in the Astral, since he pulled an Ulutiu.  The Far Realm pantheon IMO should be left fairly mysterious, with only vague references/mythology described + mechanics of becoming a cultist or cleric to them.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">-So my general question is do you think there is a particular pantheon or genre that might deserve a special niche (or at least more detail)?</span></p>

<p>The Slavic pantheon, definitely.  Although this might be difficult because some of the deties are facsimiles to Norse powers, but with slightly different stories.  There's also the problem of Volos, since among some slavic tribes he was a destroyer deity and mortal enemy of Perun (facsimile of Thor), while among other tribes he was a neutral deity of cattle and the underworld.  <br />
Also difficult to reconcile is the fact that Mokosh is the facsimile of Freya and is married to Perun (facsimile of Thor).  <br />
Also, I think other facsimiles need to be integrated into the pantheons.<br />
For instance, Ratri is practically identical to Nyx the Protogenai from Greco-Roman mythology.  Mitra from Hindu mythology is also practically identical to Mithra from Persian and Roman mythology.  Many members of the Slavic and Saxon pantheon are simply Slavic/Saxonized versions of Norse deities (both pantheons appeared in Dragon Magazine post-OD&amp;D)<br />
The protogenoi also need to be described, fluffed out, and separated from the Titans (the Protogenoi are the race that preceded the Titans, and include Chaos, Uranus, Erebus, and Gaia.)</p>

<p>I've been working on the Raptorian pantheon, so you don't need to worry about that, though the other Seldarine members from Dragon 251 and 236 need to be encorporated (don't worry about the two Snow Elf deities; they're not part of the Seldarine and I'm working on them.)<br />
The Goliath and Illumian pantheon definitely need work, as does the warrior pantheon from Complete Warrior, some of the deities from Sandstorm and Stormwrack, and Iborighu from Frostburn (it's pretty obvious where Hleid is-- part of her essense is on the Astral while the rest of it is on a specific prime world in the form of rimefire eidolons-- probably Oerth.)  I believe there are a couple powers in Libris Mortis who need work, as well.  </p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">I also think the mythology of Central America (Mayan, Aztec, etc.) is very interesting and very under-represented in standard DnD. It’s a complex pantheon that covers a lot of unique portfolios. The gods are often depicted with a certain savageness that make them unique (yes, I realize a lot of that might be cultural bias from the reports of invading Euorpeans). Also, the idea of a sweltering jungle adventure to reach giant pyramids tickles my imagination.</span><br />
The Aztec mythos already has a good bit of writeups in 2E.  <br />
One pantheon I eventually plan to work on a bit is the NW Coast Amerindian one.  Coyote, Thunderbird, Great Spirit, and Raven are already well detailed in 2E books, though the Thunderbird in those is the Great Plains version (the NW Coast version catches whales much like an eagle catches salmon and is credited for the creation of man in Chinook mythology.)  Also lacking are Seagull (Raven's mortal enemy, LOL it's funny because it's true), and Sisiutl (a divine rubber boa/whale chimera that Thunderbird likes to catch which represents the salmon).</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">The gods are often depicted with a certain savageness that make them unique</span><br />
Actually, the Aztec pantheon is extremely similar to the Hindu one in dualisticness except that they don't take on separate aspects in order to act contrarian.  For instance, in Aztec mythology, the goddess of fertility, childbirth, and protection is also the goddess of the underworld and of violent death.  She appears as a fierocious skeleton of a female warrior (since childbirth was viewed as a literal battle to the Aztecs).  This appelation is actually much closer to animist versions of the spirits and deities, being neither good nor evil, but embodying both the beneficial and malevolent aspects of a concept (for instance, in all forms of animism where the dead are buried, the female fertility deity/earth goddess is also the goddess of famine, sickness, and death.  Likewise, the sky deity represents rulership, fertility, and vitality, but also famine/drought, plague, and death.  Water deities would represent life and fertility, but also flood, disease, and destruction.  Sky deities would be appeased by immolating human and/or animal sacrifices, sometimes burning them alive.  Earth deities would be appeased by either burying the sacrifice alive or by throwing them *either alive or dead* into a pit.  Water deities would be appeased by drowning the sacrifice.  The general rule of sacrifices throughout history and prehistory is that it has to be the most valuable thing they have-- either the first batch of harvest or first born domestic animal, or the first-born son, the most beautiful maiden in the village, or a member of the royal/chieftain's/ruling family.)<br />
The Aztecs also held a very Norse-like view that only those who die in battle (or in human sacrifice) will enter heaven.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>Palomides</em> wrote:</div>I also think the mythology of Central America (Mayan, Aztec, etc.) is very interesting and very under-represented in standard DnD. It’s a complex pantheon that covers a lot of unique portfolios. The gods are often depicted with a certain savageness that make them unique (yes, I realize a lot of that might be cultural bias from the reports of invading Euorpeans). Also, the idea of a sweltering jungle adventure to reach giant pyramids tickles my imagination.</div></p>

<p>Interesting thread.</p>

<p>The Maztica campaign setting (a subset of Forgotten Realms) would probably have much that would interest you.  There are 3 novels written by Douglas Niles which I read probably close to 20 years ago, but I recall them being of acceptable quality.  </p>

<p>There is also a boxed set with lots of material regarding their gods - as they play such a vital part in day to day life - influencing their customs, their classes (Jaguar Knights, Hishnashapers, etc.) as well as plenty of other fluff and crunch.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>So far, I have only read the related Maztica adventure modules which aren't that involved with the pantheon (or even much of the culture). I have a copy of the campaign setting that I will get to eventually and hopefully, I'll enjoy all the material you mention.</p>

<p>My point was rather that while one hears/sees the presence of certain pantheons taking actions or effecting things in Planescape; the Meso-American inspired gods just get a footnote (e.g. Quetzalcoatl/Qotal is placed on Mt. Celestia but I don't recall him every being tied to any happenings on the planes)<br />
Of course with the retcon of the Forgotten Realms, I suppose you could argue that they didn't/don't have much impact even on a world where they were supposed to be active. </p>

<p>I only recall (I think) a passing encounter to a Meso-American goddess in the old "Tales of the Outer Planes" supplement. If there are a few others, there is no need to correct me. I'm just saying that these deities seem like interesting "characters" that could generate a lot of interesting situations and adventures and I don't think they have really been used that way yet.</p>

<p>As an incredibly simple example, what if planar travelers suddenly noticed a lot of coatls flying back and forth from Mt. Celestia to remote spots or abandoned temples in jugle-locations throughout the Great Ring? I don't even know where I'm going with this but I could see a lot of agents (fiendish and even other celestials outside that pantheon) being very curious as to what the formerly "dormant" Quetzalcoatl is doing and sending the PCs into his jungle realm to ask.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Planescape probably avoided Central American and North American deities largely because the location of their realms was problematic in canon. 1st edition <span style="font-style:italic">Deities &amp; Demigods</span> placed all the Central American gods on an "alternate Prime Material Plane" rather than in the Outer Planes where most of the action in the Planescape campaign setting takes place. 2nd edition <span style="font-style:italic">Legends &amp; Lore</span> said that the Aztec gods lived in outer space, and could be visited by spelljammers. Quetzalcoatl was said in that book to live on the planet Venus. 1st edition scattered the North American deities all across the planes, many of them in the Inner Planes, while 2nd edition put them all in special demiplanes called the Upper and Lower Worlds (again, placing them largely outside of the planes used in the Planescape setting). Planescape always deferred to 2nd edition <span style="font-style:italic">Legends &amp; Lore</span>, or to 1st edition <span style="font-style:italic">Deities &amp; Demigods</span> in those cases where the two sources didn't conflict.</p>

<p>The deities of Maztica, by contrast, were explicitly all given realms in the Outer Planes. Qotal was indeed placed in Mount Celestia (in Jovar). Plutoq lives in Mechanus. Azul has a realm in Arcadia, Watil is in Elysium, Klitzi is in Arborea, Nula is in Ysgard, Eha is in Limbo, Tezca is in Pandemonium, and Zaltec and Tezca are in the Abyss. If Maztica had been a more popular campaign setting, Planescape adventures and sourcebooks probably would have made a lot more use of those particular gods.</p>

<p>I do think the Maztica method is better for Planescape, and it does imply the existence of Central American gods in some of Maztica's outer planar realms, if only because Mictlan (in Niflheim) should obviously be Mictlantecuhtli's realm, and Tlalocan in Abellio should obviously be the realm of Tlaloc and Chalchihuitlicue. Since Tlalocan and Mictlan are afterlives, of <span style="font-style:italic">course</span> they should be in the outer planes, but for whatever reason no one in the Planescape era contradicted the idea that they were somewhere on the Prime.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reocities.com/Area51/Vault/9974/aztec.htm" class="bb-url">Alex Roberts and Skypti</a> did some work incorporating the Aztec gods into Planescape's Great Wheel, however. Skypti complained about some of the changes Alex made to her original work, but whatever. Might be worth taking a look at. Note that it was apparently written without awareness of the Maztican precedents.</p>

<p>Xochipilli and Tlazolteotl appear in<span style="font-style:italic"> Tales of the Outer Planes</span> on an unnamed "jungle world."</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Hm.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">They took our gods.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">No, we gave them up.  We didn't want them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">We loved them.  They made us.  And then they left us.  For humans.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Let the humans take them, sacrifice to them, believe in them.  They demanded too much.  They hungered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Living things hunger.  Our gods were alive.  Green.  Primal.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">They were red.  Red of blood, and flame.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Blood is part of life.  They were part of us.  They lived with us.  They were the Sun, the morning star, the upper airs.  They were Coyote, Raven, Spider, the animals and the trees.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">But living things, even living gods, die.  Our gods knew this.  We knew this.  We saw them die.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">They were reborn.  Such is the cycle of life.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Does that make death better?  Our gods did not wish to die anymore.  Who does?  So they took stronger belief from souls that were less tied to the world.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">No!  Our worlds are beautiful!  There is light and laughter under hill, and the deep dales echo with our fiddle and song!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">And darkness.  The upper airs are very dark, and very cold.  We know.  Such is our soul.  The gods discarded us.  They wanted better.  They offered themselves to humans.  The humans were glad to take their blessings.  Let the gods go live in the lands of the dead.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">The dead?  Our beautiful land is dead without their blessings.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">They were merciful, in their way.  They left us with strength unknown to all other races.  We are better than all those mortal.  We don't need gods.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">We can tend the land, be one with it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">We can take a world and make it our own.  Just to the side of the rest of the world.  Just below it.  Just above it.  Where we can watch.  We can take theirs, if we want to.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">We must make our own blessings.</span></p>

         <p>Tying it into the discussion of Faerie elsewhere on the forums.  I'm suggesting that an explanation for the Native American pantheons' apparent wandering of home realm is because they were once the gods of the fairies, and early in human history made a successful bid for human belief in their regions.</p>

<p>The human belief was strong enough to seize and change them, breaking their tie to their children, but before they were cut off entirely they altered the nature of the fairies so they could sustain themselves without gods, giving them their own version of a divine realm to work with, for good or ill.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Actually, for me, put Faerie down as another mythology that never got enough screentime in Planescape, even though homebrewers seem to love it. I've personally made up some fluff for it, even though I never wrote it down...<br />
Faerie was once it's own plane, parallel to the prime, like shadow or the border ethereal (or 4Es Feywild). But when the Queens started the civil war between Seelie and Unseelie, it broke apart and pieces of it were scattered across the planes, so that faerie realms can now be found everywhere from the outlands to the ethereal.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><span style="font-style:italic">I do think the Maztica method is better for Planescape, and it does imply the existence of Central American gods in some of Maztica's outer planar realms, if only because Mictlan (in Niflheim) should obviously be Mictlantecuhtli's realm, and Tlalocan in Abellio should obviously be the realm of Tlaloc and Chalchihuitlicue. Since Tlalocan and Mictlan are afterlives, of course they should be in the outer planes, but for whatever reason no one in the Planescape era contradicted the idea that they were somewhere on the Prime.</p>

<p>Alex Roberts and Skypti did some work incorporating the Aztec gods into Planescape's Great Wheel, however. Skypti complained about some of the changes Alex made to her original work, but whatever. Might be worth taking a look at. Note that it was apparently written without awareness of the Maztican precedents.</p>

<p>Xochipilli and Tlazolteotl appear in Tales of the Outer Planes on an unnamed "jungle world."</span></p>

<p>In that case, perhaps I'll return the Amerindian pantheon to their places in 1E when I work on the Pchughstick/NW Anchorome stuff some more.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>On the one hand I support the addition of previosly overseen pantheons, and that is what I tried to do on my previous work about Turkic nomadic religion. On the other hand when I look at the setting I see way too many human deities, and I think monstrous powers need a larger representation. One good way to do this is fuse certain monsters or monstrous humanoids with these pantheons, so their gods will serve a double purpose.<br />
For some pantheons this is relatively easy. For example, I can say that Turkish Deity/Spirit Yersu also is the goddess of nature spirits, giving her a power base outside nomadic humans and a bit more fluff, while also making her interesting for non-nomadic encounters. Same thing, I can say that nomadic horsemen share a number of powers with Centaurs (whose historical origins lie in these cultures anyway).<br />
For non nomadic powers, I think same could be done for certain Mesoamerican deities tying in with Draconic detities, deities of more advanced and civilized lizardmen, and Yuan-ti. The results; more interesting and complex powers and monstrous creatures. <br />
Rakshasa tying into Indian Myth is a very good example, and should be expanded.<br />
Another approach, which I also tried for Nomadic Powers, is to use them to enhance parts or places of the planes where they exist. We can easily place any pantheon on a layer of a plane that is not the first - seriously, we saw again and again just how deserted some planar layers are when compared to the first. In my unfinished work with nomads, I opted to have the petitioners travel on the 3rd layer of Arborea. This has the double benefit of making the layer less empty, and making the pantheon just a little more special. Plus; if I wanted, I can say this layer ties in to the *surface* of the 3rd layer of ysgard (normally an underground layer), and some wasteland in Beastlands, via border portals only the petitioners know. Which brings me to my last point:<br />
Making the newcoming pantheons useful to the PCs in some way is just as important as adding them to the setting at all. Most pantheons currently in the game achieve this by including travel options; Yggdrassil, Mount Olympus, Celestial Beurocracy's palace of Justice in outlands, etc... For the Nomads, I did the same thing, but to preserve the nomadic flavor, I said that the nomads actually physically travel from plane to plane via a long route, using secret portals when they reach planar border areas, and they visit their respective realms and sites along this route. PCs can join in this eternal exodus for a time, help out defending and feeding the nomads, and drop off at the plane of destination. Roleplayable by: 1 - 2 random combat encounters, 1 - 2 social encounters in the tribe, and some storytelling.<br />
In summary, to succesfully represent new pantheons, we can look at these 3:<br />
1. tie- ins with existing creatures.<br />
2. Using underdeveloped planar areas<br />
3. Making it useful to the pcs.</p>

<p>Hope this is useful</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I always thought the ancient, progenitor gods from the beginning of time were absent. I had a pantheon of gods known as the Primordials in my campaign. They were basically several progenitor gods from various religons. It's members were Kaos from Greek mythology, Ymir from Norse mythology, and Ogdoad from Egyptian mythology (technically eight gods in one). They are worshipped by the Cult of the Cosmic Egg.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I previously suggested the Yoruba deities which are closely tied with the Voodoun deities and Loa, but there's also other African pantheons that could do with a little more coverage.</p>

<p>I certainly have toyed with the idea of combining various progenitors deities of different pantheons into the 4e Primordials, and making those Primordials less "bad" as they've been depicted everywhere in that editions canon, with the exception of FR, which seems to be more balanced on that subject.</p>

<p>Also I remember that  Mimir had an article on non-evil Orc Deities, could be something to elaborate more on, even though I tend to think of non-evil Orcs as being more Animists/Shamanic as opposed to religious.  </p>

<p>One complaint that many had about the Humanoid deities before was their racial exclusiveness.  So some more could be done on why a Goblin would follow Correllon, or why an Elf might worship Gruumsh.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><span style="font-style:italic">On the other hand when I look at the setting I see way too many human deities, and I think monstrous powers need a larger representation. One good way to do this is fuse certain monsters or monstrous humanoids with these pantheons, so their gods will serve a double purpose.</span></p>

<p>I agree.  I have developed an additional Zahkaran diety to better cover the Qorrashi Genies (can't remember his name, but he's a power of snow, cold, and mountain peaks, along with steadfastness and traditionalism)<br />
The elven pantheon is pretty good-sized if you include the powers from Dragons 236 and 251, and I'm working a bit on the two from 236 of the Snow Elves.<br />
The Raptorian pantheon is likely to count the aaracokra among their ranks, and Raven (the Amerindian deity) is SURELY beloved by the Kenku (and you can bet there will be Kenku in North and South Pchughstick Allele; they fit perfectly with the Amerindian portrayal of ravens as rogues and tricksters.)  Thunderbird (the deity, not the creature) is surely worshipped by the Arrowhawks.  I mean come on, he's perfect for them.<br />
Sisiutl (the deity, not the creature) is likely worshipped by the Darfellians from Stormwrack along with a few other aquatic races.  (Sisiutl is depicted in NW Amerindian mythology as a divine/gigantic rubber boa, whale, or a combination of the two, and is the favorite food of thunderbird.  Yes, the NW Coast Amerindians believed that thunderbirds caught whales instead of salmon.)<br />
When/if I really get into the Pchughstick stuff, I might contact some Chinook tribal webmasters about info.  While, certainly it is D&amp;D we're talking about here (and understandably the idea of their beloved cultural heroes and deities being adapted to a P&amp;P RPG might seem a bit blasphemous), part of my intention, is to have historical commentary to go along with the in-game fluff and mechanics.  Though certainly I am not the least bit related to the Chinook or other NW coast peoples, I admit that I still take a certain amount of pride in their stories and accomplishments, since they were the original people in the land I was born and have lived my entire life in (Portland, OR)  <br />
Also, I imagine that Syranita counts Raptorians among her worshippers, considering that her church also includes kenku and avariel.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">For non nomadic powers, I think same could be done for certain Mesoamerican deities tying in with Draconic detities, deities of more advanced and civilized lizardmen, and Yuan-ti.</span><br />
Goodman Games already took this route in Dungeon Crawl Classics 16.<br />
There's also a Dragon article from 2E that depicts of the South African mantis gods as a divine thri-keen, who is worshipped by thri-keen at least as much (if not more) than he is worshipped by humans.  (the mantis is a very sacred animal in Sub-Saharan Africa, and was also sacred to Egyptians.)<br />
BTW, one of the 2E Dragon articles presents an African campaign setting based heavily on a series of fantasy novels that take place in a parralel Sub Saharan Africa.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">I always thought the ancient, progenitor gods from the beginning of time were absent. I had a pantheon of gods known as the Primordials in my campaign. They were basically several progenitor gods from various religons. It's members were Kaos from Greek mythology, Ymir from Norse mythology, and Ogdoad from Egyptian mythology (technically eight gods in one). They are worshipped by the Cult of the Cosmic Egg.</span></p>

<p>Interesting you mention that, because Greco-Roman mythology has a race that preceded the Titanes: the Protogenoi.  Many of them would translate into D&amp;D as elemental powers (such as Thalassus).  The reign of the protogenoi was thwarted when Chronus castrated Uranus, the king of the protogenoi, for his tyrrany (IIRC Uranus feared that his sons would overthrow him, so he either ate or imprisoned them, I don't remember which.  This is a recurring theme among all three of the divine races in Greco-Roman mythology.  ).  The protogenoi include Nyx, Erebus, Gaea, Chaos, Uranus, and Anake.  </p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">I certainly have toyed with the idea of combining various progenitors deities of different pantheons into the 4e Primordials, and making those Primordials less "bad" as they've been depicted everywhere in that editions canon, with the exception of FR, which seems to be more balanced on that subject.</span></p>

<p>I hate this idea.  Mainly because, if you look in the timeline I've made thus far, there is a bit of a gap between the first elemental god and the first flesh-based power,  and the latter were primordial deities more akin to Ghaunadaur or an anthropomorphic seaweed mass, etc. than to most of the powers we have today.  In fact, the first deities supplicated by mortals would have been arthropodic and brachiopodic, since those are the first advanced types of organisms that arose IRL.  So you'd have gods of the trilobite men, gods of weird tentacled and spined creatures that look like an amalgalation of arthropod, brachiopod, and cephalopod, with maybe a bit of anthozoan thrown in for good measure.  <br />
Awesome.<br />
Chances are these gods are long dead of course.<br />
In addition, the Titans didn't arise until far, far later, and in Greco-Roman mythology they were preceded by the Protogenoi.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

Tengu (OA), Tako (OA), Lhosk (MMIII), Selkie (Fiend Folio), Witchknife (MMIII), Yak Folk (MMII), Thri-Keen (MMII), Xeph (Expanded Psionics)<br />
The Yeti definitely need a patron deity-- all they have right now are Auril and Cryonax.  I believe there was a Yeti deity homebrewed in the Realms L Archives for 2E, so we might be able to use that.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>The yakfolk worship the Faceless God, who has enslaved the dao thanks to a bet with their khan. He's described in the Land of Fate boxed set and more extensively in a Dragon article I'll have to look up later. Thri-kreen worship nature, though their ancestors had an older religion mentioned in the Spelljammer line. The selkies worship their goddess Surminare. Quaggoths worship Nerull. Chitines are fanatics of Lolth. Meazels worship Baalzebul according to 4e's MM3, who more or less created them from plague-stricken humans. The patron of khaastas is Sess'innek according to Scaly Kingdoms.</p>

<p>That's what it is in both 2e and 3e. They have pretty much the same alignment (given as neutral with good tendencies in 2e, and neutral in 3e), the same hit dice. The differences are minor: 3rd edition selkies have gray eyes in their human form, while 2nd edition selkies are noted as having bright green or blue eyes. 2nd edition selkies have hands and legs (while being otherwise seal-like) in their seal forms, while 3rd edition selkies are indistinguishable from seals when in that form. But it's very much the same creature in both editions. It seems safe to assume that the domains given for selkie clerics (Healing, Protection, and Water) are Surminare's domains.</p>

<p>Pretty sure I've read that you have to have a patron deity in order to receive divine magic/supernatural abilities (as a cleric, druid, shaman, ranger, or paladin) on Abeir-Toril (at least on the continent of Faerun, anyway).  The whole "primal spirits" is a 4E-exclusive thing, anyway (and no, even 3x Eberron does not possess the primal spirits stuff or anything similar.  The Eberron druids, rangers, and shamans worship abstract concepts and nature itself, which is quite different from literally worshipping nature spirits.)</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>That's a complicated issue, but basically, many of the beings that are considered "primal spirits" in 4th edition were considered gods in earlier editions. The list of primal spirits in "Realmslore: Sarifal" in Dragon #376 includes the Earthmother of the Moonshaes (considered in some other sources to be an aspect of Chauntea, though this was originally a retcon), the World Serpent (the original sarrukh deity in <span style="font-style:italic">Serpent Kingdoms</span>), Remnis (an eagle god in <span style="font-style:italic">Monster Mythology</span>), Quorlinn (the god of kenku), and Nobanion. The implication seems to be that many of the entities worshiped in the "beast cults" that have been part of the Realms since 1st edition are considered to be primal spirits in 4th edition. In 1st edition, many of them were considered to be demigods or lesser deities. </p>

<p>While the precise way that "primal spirits" were defined in <span style="font-style:italic">Primal Power</span> is new, it is actually close to the way that spirits were defined in the 2nd edition supplement <span style="font-style:italic">Shaman</span> (1995). Both supplements describe ancestor spirits and mention that if their descendants no longer believe in them, they can die. Both also describe the "spirit world" as not being a true plane that mortals can visit, but more a way of referring to the way spirits co-exist invisibly with the world of mortals. The various types of spirits - ancestral spirits, animal spirits, hero spirits, guardian spirits of places, and Great Spirits who represent vast natural phenomena like the North Wind, Fire, and Lightning - all have their parallels in 4th edition spirits. The basic idea of spirits - that they're personifications of the power of the natural world - is essentially the same in both 2nd and 4th edition. Where they differ is that <span style="font-style:italic">Shaman</span> reveals in the DM's section of the book that spirits are all actually born from mortal belief, reflecting mortal desires, fears, hopes, and terrors. <span style="font-style:italic">Primal Power</span> never states that, and suggests they might be as old or older than the world. </p>

<p>Planescape's <span style="font-style:italic">On Hallowed Ground</span> (1996, a year after <span style="font-style:italic">Shaman</span>) seemed to accept <span style="font-style:italic">Shaman</span>'s definition of spirits. On page 34, Colin McComb suggests that spirits are created from mortal legends and eventually, buoyed by mortal worship, evolve into gods. This is different from 4th edition's take that primal spirits are approximately equal to the gods in power, and an entirely separate kind of entity (as different from gods as gods are from primordials, and more abstract and subjective than either) - but then, the definition of what a god is has changed between editions as well. </p>

<p>It's interesting to me that what 2nd edition's <span style="font-style:italic">Legends &amp; Lore</span> book (1990) calls the "American Indian Pantheon" meshes very closely with what <span style="font-style:italic">Shaman</span> describes as "Great Spirits." If that book had been published four years later, I think it's likely that it might have followed <span style="font-style:italic">Shaman</span>'s lead in defining those beings and the "Upper and Lower worlds" from which they hail. Certainly they're very close to 4th edition "primal spirits" as well.</p>

<p>So while it's broadly true that in the 3.x Forgotten Realms, divine casters need gods to grant their spells, I think that the beings labeled as "primal spirits" in 4e are what in earlier editions would either be classified as gods or as beings who might potentially evolve into gods, given more worship. It's also true that 3.x Forgotten Realms products provided feats that divine casters could take that allowed them to get spells from demon lords, devils, yugoloths, and even dead gods and blasphemous faiths (for example, the Servant of the Fallen feat in <span style="font-style:italic">Lost Empires of Faerun</span>, Disciple of Darkness, Scion of Sorrow, and Thrall to Demon in <span style="font-style:italic">Champions of Ruin</span>). So essentially, a 3.x Forgotten Realms character didn't need a god after all, but it was a little harder for them to gain divine spells from other beings  (reflected by the need for a feat). </p>

<p>All that said, saying quaggoths worship "primal spirits" isn't very much more specific than saying they worship "the gods," so we're back at square one in deciding who they worship in the Forgotten Realms campaign. If they worship Nerull in the Greyhawk setting, it might seem likely that they worshiped his counterpart Myrkul. After Myrkul's death, it's conceivable that he is the "source of primal power" they're seeking out. They might be looking for remnants of their patron they believe has become part of the subterranean landscape. Another possibility is the Deep Winds, spirits of the Underdark described in <span style="font-style:italic">Primal Power</span>, which Underdark races look to for guidance and protection. In addition, ancestral spirits, location spirits, the Great Bear, and the Primal Beast might be particularly appropriate for quaggoths.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><span style="font-style:italic">So while it's broadly true that in the 3.x Forgotten Realms, divine casters need gods to grant their spells</span><br />
It was true in 2E as well, as stated in Faiths &amp; Avatars.</p>

I'm well aware of that, as well as the feats to get spells from celestials in BoED, and Elemental Devotee (to get spells from Archomentals) in Denizens of the Inner Planes on this site.<br />
Those beings are not abstract forces or personifications, however.</p>

<p>Also, I'm planning to make some of the nature spirits of NW Coast Amerindian mythology (such as the east wind) be aspects of Faerunian deities (East Wind would be an aspect of Auril, for instance, which yes, would be possible, since NW Anchorome has two mountain ranges that stretch down the western coast from the arctic.)</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Speaking of the Aztec/Mesoamerican Pantheon, I'm working on incorporating the godly realm info present in the Maztica boxed set with the version on the pantheon presented in Dragon Magazine. So far I've identified some of the Mazticn deities with their mesoamerican equivalents. The rest I've not found/decided on an equivalnet, so I'll probably just ignore:</p>

<p>Qotal &gt; Quetzalcoatl<br />
Zaltec/Tezca &gt; Tezcatlipoca (Both have traits identified with Tezcatlipoca)<br />
Azul &gt; Tlaloc<br />
Kiltzi &gt; Xochipilli<br />
Watil &gt; Centeotl<br />
Nula &gt; Mixcoatl</p>

Maztica is like Coatlicue (in that she's the mother-goddess).<br />
Qotal is Quetzalcoatl, of course.<br />
Zaltec is based closely on Huitzilopochtli.<br />
Azul is Tlaloc, to the point of even living in Tlaloc's realm of Tlalocan.<br />
Plutoq is perhaps like Itztli, god of stone.<br />
Tezca is probably most like Tonatiuh.<br />
Kiltzi is Chalchiuhtlicue.<br />
Eha is most like Ehecatl.<br />
Watil is like Chicomecoatl and/or Centeotl.<br />
Nula is a combination of all Aztec animal deities. Keep in mind that she has a lesser aspect for every animal species. So she's at the same time the coyote god Huehuecoyotl, the turkey god Chalchihuihtotolin, the jaguar god Tepeyollotl, and the dog-god Xolotl. And she's all 4,000 rabbit deities.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>The more interesting question (for me) is, for those of you who actually use the Meso-American pantheon(s) (or pantheons obviously inspired by them), how do you actually portray these gods?<br />
My experience is mostly from 1E and 2E, where they were inconsistantly portrayed, usually with very dark overtones and where they were said to live in a parallel Outlands dimension. It wasn't a very good depiction (IMHO) and you could almost sense that the designers were struggling to find a niche for them</p>

<p>Do you make (some of ) them more positive and downplay or minimize the human sacrifice?<br />
Do you make them so alien in outlook that they are incomprehensible to mortals?<br />
Do you take the Maztica route and take elements to make your own version of Meso-American gods that you can assign whatever personality you wish?<br />
In which plane(s) do you place the majority of this pantheon? Or do you create a new location for them?</p>

<p>It seems like some great adventure could be set in the jungles of a Meso-American realm (earthly or planar) where the PCs have to deal with the difficulties of the jungle and with the culture shock of a people and their gods that they don't understand</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>This seems like a decent place to put a few "pantheons" that I've thought about but haven't had much of an idea on how to use, which are tightly tied to the Prime Material Plane:</p>

<p>*) The Four Creatures of feng shui: the White Tiger of the West, the Black Turtle of the North, the Green Dragon of the East, and the Red Phoenix (or Ho-o) of the South. Sometimes including a fifth, the Yellow Snake of the Center.  Many non-Prime planes don't even have a consistent concept of North!  Each is associated with an element, as well, suggesting clerical traditions to go with them.  And, of course, green dragons are normally intelligent and evil in D&amp;D...</p>

<p>*) The Zodiac: twelve rulers of the year (and a secret thirteenth).  It would be a very curious phenomenon if multiple Primes had consistent constellations, and this pantheon of gods divides among them the elements, the year, the alignments, and all other functions of these worlds.  Populations exalting them would have deep beliefs in astrological fate and cycles (Unity of Rings), and possibly significant industries of mages, especially diviners.  Given that the figures themselves come from both Greek and Egyptian myths, but are relatively minor, you might even have an ecumenical "council" of those particular figures cultivating the worship of those worlds.</p>

<p>*) Human gods.  The mythology of this world would hold that humans arose naturally, and later realized how to ascend to godhood -- some by personal enlightenment, some off the tribute-worship of subjugated empires.  One country's Senate elects its representatives to the pantheon, and can demote them too.  The deified humans hold perfectly normal, if small, divine realms in various Outer Planes, but their interests are primarily back home.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><span style="font-style:italic">Do you make (some of ) them more positive and downplay or minimize the human sacrifice?</span></p>

<p>I have not yet used them, but, I think I would classify them as True Neutral at heart, since they are closely related to Animist theology where the gods are merely personifications of nature-- which is neither good nor evil.<br />
For instance, in Animism (or at least its less hippie-new-age-foo-foo strains), a mother earth goddess for instance has the following portfolio:<br />
Agriculture<br />
Birth and life (the "Womb of Life")<br />
Death, the Underworld, and the grave (the "Womb of Death")<br />
Drought and Famine (association with barrenness of the land)<br />
Earthquakes<br />
Foraging<br />
Fertility (of the earth, sexual, of nature, of the hunt)<br />
Plants and vegetation<br />
In ancient times, all animist religions and cults practiced human sacrifice in the form of live burial, throwing victims into a deep pit, taking lives inside a cavern, or draining a victim of blood which is allowed to leak into the soil or sand.  The neolithic Minoans would strangle or exsanguinate *via ritual knives* male children and throw the bodies into a deep pit.  Some believe that the legend of the Minotaur (an ancient portmanaeu of "Minoan taurus") is partially based on fragmented memory *passed down orally* of this ancient practice *the Minoans worshipped bulls and used them in many of their rites, including bull riding*</p>

<p>Water deities held the following portfolio: *though ocean and freshwater deities were usually separate*<br />
Death/the grave/the underworld (only among the Inuit and other societies where funerary rites involves burial at sea)<br />
Droughts<br />
Floods<br />
Freshwater's Bounty (fish, pearls, irrigation, oasies, etc.)<br />
Life-giving water<br />
Sea's Bounty (fish, seaweed, dyes, shellfish, etc.)<br />
Sea and Coastal Storms (particularly maelstroms, hurricanes/typhoons/monsoons/Cyclones, etc.)<br />
Tidal Waves and Tsunami<br />
Likewise, the ancient animists all gave sacrifices to these deities or to the waters themselves.  This was always done in the form of drowning.</p>

<p>Sky deities held the following portfolio:<br />
Cremation<br />
Death/the Crematorium/the underworld (only in societies where funerary rites invariably involved cremation, the smoke viewed as the soul ascending to the heavens)<br />
Drought/Famine (as the lack of rain and heat of the sun)<br />
Disease/Plague (many societies, esp. beginning with the Semites and the Persians, viewed disease as being carried on winds by the breaths of demons and other evil spirits of the skies and mountains.  Many Amerindian groups also believed this even prior to contact with settlers, and the Japanese appear to have held the same view about the common cold, whose word can be translated literally from Japanese as "The Great Wind".  As smallpox spread due to trade and exploration, all societies came to view it as caused by an evil wind or breath blown by the devil-- in fact, the word for smallpox in many languages, including Japanese, is "Devil's Wind" or "Evil Wind")<br />
Light<br />
Thunder/Lightning<br />
Wildfires and house/village fires<br />
As with the other two categories, the ancient animists all gave sacrifices to the sky gods/spirits.  This was usually done via immolation, since the smoke reaches the sky (also, many cultures, esp. those of Mediterranean or desert climates, associated the sky deity strongly with the sun and its "flames".)</p>

<p>*) The Four Creatures of feng shui: the White Tiger of the West, the Black Turtle of the North, the Green Dragon of the East, and the Red Phoenix (or Ho-o) of the South. Sometimes including a fifth, the Yellow Snake of the Center. Many non-Prime planes don't even have a consistent concept of North! Each is associated with an element, as well, suggesting clerical traditions to go with them. And, of course, green dragons are normally intelligent and evil in D&amp;D...</p>

<p>I've thought about doing those.  They're called "The Four Divine Beasts" BTW (At least in Japanese)  And in fact there are five (there's also the Golden Dragon of the Center, which represents the element of Earth)  Also, it's actually the "Blue Dragon" (Chinese and Japanese originally had the same word for both green and blue, just like the Europeans.  In pictures the dragon always appears as ultramarine blue.)</p>

<p>Also, there's a lot more than just colors and elements associated with them in Feng Shui.  I do not know where the papers went that I printed out, but back in '03 or '04 I printed out some papers from Japanese sites that had charts of the herbs, grains, smells, etc. associated by element (these are used in Traditional Chinese Medicine)  I believe I recompiled some of the stuff in one of my files here...  Along with it, I was working on remodelling the Wujen and Shugenja magic systems to make them more oriental, or at least by more MODERN contemporary means.</p>

<p>This is part of the file right here:<br />
In general, modernized versions of the 5 classical Chinese elements, at least in Japan, are usually merged with the 4 western elements and their subtypes.<br />
Fire and Water are prettymuch the same.<br />
However, in Japan, plants are associated with wind instead of earth, due to the blowing of falling cherry blossoms (called "hanafubuki" or "flower blizzard"), falling leaves, fungal/fern spores/pollen, and the blowing of wind-dispersed seeds such as dandelion.<br />
Earth on the other hand is merged with both metal and electricity (electricity due to its conductivity with metal).  In many videogames, the offensive spells, aligned by element, tend to be fire, ice/cold, electricity, and wind.<br />
Thus, if you wanted to re-align the Wujen and Shugenja's spells by element, then they should be as follows:</p>

<p>--Air spells become wood spells or vice versa for the two classes.  Sonic spells are also associated with wind.  <br />
--Electricity spells become part of the Earth school for Shugenja and part of the Metal school for Wujen.<br />
--Most of the abstract associations by element actually do align with those given in Complete Divine, though some of them, such as illusions and enchantments/mind affecting overlap with both fire and wind.  In particular, fear (associated with howling wind), sleep, and confusion and insanity are associated with wind, while charm is more often associated with fire.  Paralysis is associated with both electricity *metal* and ice *water*<br />
Poison is usually associated with the element of wood, as are status-removing spells-- though poison can just as easily be associated with metal *though the peoples of the Far East held a far poorer understanding of metal poisoning for far longer than the west did*.  Protecton spells are associated with earth and metal.<br />
--Darkness spells are usually associated with water (the association being with squid ink).  Blinding flashes are associated with both fire and metal.  Illusion spells are sometimes associated with fire due to heat shimmer/haze and mirages.<br />
--Curses are associated with fire due to a type of voodoo-like black magick system found in some parts of Japanese culture called "Uji no Kokumairi" or "Uji no Tokigoro".  The two primary rituals associated with it are dancing around a sacred tree (or Shinboku) while wearing a headband of lit candles, and the use of voodoo-like curse dolls-- a straw doll smeared in the victim's blood, with an iron nail driven through the chest.  Both are used to place curses, though the former is associated with summoning and binding demons, while the latter is used specifically to kill the cursed victim.</p>

<p>Darn, it seems I never made those notes.  (The thing about restructuring the elements slightly is the only thing I found).  Seems likely I'll have to re-search and retranslate that stuff, ugh.</p>

<p>Anyhow, the five divine beasts (or godbeasts) would be quasi-powers, and not actual deities.  They would probably be part of the Celestial Bureaucracy.<br />
Also, it's worth noting that in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean folklore, the tiger and the dragon are rivals *even mortal enemies*, opposites, and equals.  You can often find these theme subtly in many anime, such as Scry-Ed, where Ryuuhou is clearly associated with the dragon, while Kazuka is clearly associated with the Tiger.  These associations also determine their personalities-- Kazuka is brash, impulsive, strong, tough, belligerent, determined, savage/wild, outgoing, and reckless with a short temper while Ryuuhou is calm, intelligent, tactical, stealthy, obedient, disciplined, and reflective.  I would classify Ryuuhou as arrogant, but that description really fits both characters.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Being mythologically native to India, Tibet and Nepal, they could respect the Hindu pantheon.  Himavat is the Hindu god of snow.  More strictly, the yeti come from the Bon tradition, which is shamanic and thus doesn't have a lot of major gods, but rather many minor ones.  The primary figure of veneration appears from a brief search to be the Tonpa (title) Shenrab Miwoche.  Most of the sources on Bon are heavily syncretic with Buddhism.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I'm tempted to base a yeti pantheon on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%B6n" class="bb-url">pre-Buddhist Tibetan animism</a>, though without gyalpos, since they've never had kings. It depends on where on a specific world they live. Mostly I'd have them revering nature spirits rather than gods as such, unless called upon by powerful planar entities like Cryonax or Ithaqua. On Toril I might actually have them believe Ulutiu created them, which would give them an interesting connection to the shirt-tail relatives of the giantish pantheon. They might revere dead Othea as well, but they couldn't be related to her (or they'd be giant-kin, and they obviously aren't). I'd give them a different mother-goddess figure instead - and if I did that, I suppose yeti would worship the same mother-goddess on every world, or close enough. So really they just need a goddess figure, and the rest of their religion can be fleshed out with spirits and gods borrowed from neighboring cultures.</p>

<p>I note that Mixcoatl is essentially the same deity as Camaxtli, who was murdered by Tenebrous/Orcus in <span style="font-style:italic">Dead Gods</span>. But then, a lot of Aztec gods are dead, like Coyolzauhqui/Meztli, who was murdered by Huitzilopochtli shortly after his birth, but apparently remain alive in other aspects.</p>

<p>To answer Palamides's question: well, I actually don't find the question of whether the Aztec gods are evil, neutral, good, or too alien to decide very interesting at all, and I'm happy to leave it ambiguous. I do like the idea of roleplaying through culture shock, though. </p>

<p>In previous editions their alignments varied pretty widely, with some good, some evil, and some of those who accepted human sacrifice defined as neutral at various times. I summarized the different D&amp;D treatments of the Aztec/Central American mythos <a href="http://canonfire.com/cfhtml/modules.php?name=Forums&amp;file=viewtopic&amp;t=4488" class="bb-url">here</a>.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Could also make one up.</p>

<p>-----</p>

<p>In times long past, the yeti, the wild men of the snowy places, trafficked with the spirits of the world and paid fair prices in sacrifice and prayer, and all was well.  They had no gods, or if they did, their creator god had never bothered to make itself known.  Or perhaps they made themselves from the wind and snows.  The yeti do not tell such a story.  They had their spirits.</p>

<p>When the other races came to the yeti, there was talk, and there was trade, and there was war, as such things go.  The war went badly.  The shamans of the yeti were driven back by the power of the gods of the other races.  Beings such as Cryonax and the ice devils under Mephistopheles offered their protection, and some agreed, but for others the price was too high.  The men of the snow discussed among themselves, and determined that they should have a god of their own.  One old shaman, Lao, objected, still loyal to their spirits, but all others agreed.</p>

<p>They knew the art of the simulacrum, the making of bodies from ice and snow, though this would be a greater making than had ever been done before.  The shamans labored long, a nine-mile body upon the side of the mountain at the navel of the world.  They marked the mountain's seven chakra, and surrounded it in honor with the nine holy svastika.  When it was done, it was a mighty yeti, every bit worthy of becoming the body of a god.</p>

<p>But there was the last obstacle: they must have a part of a god to copy.  They summoned brave spirits, whose challenges were thrown back, and they summoned stealthy spirits, that were caught in their enemies' domains.  The yeti puzzled over their failures, and the shamans demanded to know the reason for such ineptitude.</p>

<p>"Disagreement," the spirits replied.  "Unless all the race of yeti upon this world are unanimous, we have not the strength to challenge these gods."</p>

<p>They came to the yeti who had paid tribute to devils, but these had no objection, for they hoped that their creation would be more subservient than devils.  Of all the yeti, it was only stubborn old Lao who rejected the work.  The wild men of the mountaintops pleaded with him, and invoked his reason, and tried to tempt him with the meat and strong drink of which he was fond, but all these he refused.</p>

<p>Finally, the people decided to break the obstacle, and slew him.</p>

<p>When Lao was dead, the yeti were unanimous, and the spirits were strong.  They gave the yeti their god.  The spirits ran to Lao, giving him their strength and their cunning and their lore.  As Lao's blood flowed upon the body of the god, he entered into it, and became the protector-god of the yeti.</p>

<p>Lao is a NG intermediate deity, who offers the domains of Good, Cold, Protection, Illusion, and Yeti.  His domain is in a particularly icy, windswept region of Shurrock.  If he sends a servant in anger, it is likely to be a strong yeti warrior wielding a weapon that constantly drips blood, with one leg manacled to a svastika that appears on a convenient surface nearby.  Once a year at the spring solstice, the yeti of a community gather to make sacrifices to Lao, of roast meat and strong liquor.  The shamans of the community do ritual penance for the offense done to him at the god's birth, and request his protection for the coming year.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">
