Incursion
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
In the Astral plane, the Lich Queen’s
greatest diviners and seers were seeing strange patterns and signs.<span>  </span>Signs that heralded a great change for the
githyanki, and , some said, the return of Gith herself.<span>  </span>Whether or not Vlaakith herself believed
this, she decided that it was time to launch her long-prepared for Incursion
into the material plane.<span>  </span>The official
reasons behind the Incursion, to escalate the war against the Great Enemy and
to establish githyanki empires on several prime worlds, were also a cover for
deeper reasons.<span>  </span>Vlaakiths CLVII also
sent her most trusted servants to search for places and objects of power
associated with the Liberator herself.<span> 
</span>On the world of Pharagos they searched for the Tomb of Gith and for the
Grave of the God supposedly once worshiped by their forebears, long since
deceased.<span>  </span>Others searched for Gith’s
lost regalia; her tiara, a powerful item of psionic crystals, her sword, the
very first silver sword forged on the Astral plane, and her dagger.<span>  </span>Vlaakith had searched for these items for
centuries, and her search had narrowed down their possible locations to less
than a dozen prime worlds.<span>  </span>Still, they
had been lost for millennia, and no doubt in some cases the foul illithid had
laid their slimy tenticles on them to keep the People from their rightful heritage.<span>  </span>The Lich Queen therefore sent legion upon
legion to the material plane, to establish a great empire in her name as they
searched.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span>                </span><span> </span>The world of Aebir-Toril held, somewhere, the
Sword of Gith.<span>  </span>Vlaakith’s Incursion was
well planned and laid out before hand.<span> 
</span>Instrumental in laying the groundwork were the nine orbs and
Mist-of-the-Mind.<span>  </span>Mist-of-the-Mind had
once been one of Vlaakith’s most powerful telepaths, until the Queen called her
for her final honor.<span>  </span>Instead of
consuming her essence, Vlaakith freed her spirit from her body, creating a powerful
and unique psionic ghost.<span>  </span>Unhampered by
physical fortifications, Mist-of-the-Mind traveled Faerun, possessing and
brainwashing key leaders and spies.<span>  </span>The
nine orbs were special items set into amulets, which allowed Vlaakith, using
three master orbs, to monitor the material plane from the Palace of
Whispers.<span>  </span>The amulets were given to
agents and spies, some willing some unwitting.<span> 
</span>Through them, The Lich Queen could not only scry into the Toril, but
cast any spell she wished through the orbs.<span> 
</span>This is, eventually, how she would open her gates for the invasions in
precise locations.<span>  </span>The last special
items in Vlaakith’s arsenal were the Void Bombs.<span>  </span>Created from the very essences of dead gods
of destruction, decay, and death, they were the ultimate weapon.<span>  </span>They were designed to react with all ambient
magic, explosively.<span>  </span>A void bomb could
level any city that contained magic-shaped buildings, magic items, and magic
users.<span>  </span>They were, therefore, an
especially grave threat to a magic-rich world like Toril.<span>  </span>The greater the magic in the area of a void
bomb’s activation, the greater the destruction.<span> 
</span>At the fringes of the effect (which could be miles in radius), a
barely-competent junior magician’s apprentice might but suffer a severe headache,
but be killed when his master beside him immolated in a massive fireball.<span>  </span>The existence of the void bombs was revealed
to Toril’s most senior mages as a threat and an offer.<span>  </span>Remain neutral in the coming wars, and
neither Waterdeep nor Shadowdale would be wiped off the map.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span>                </span>The
first step in the Incursion was to cause instability in the current power
balances in order to make a possible first base of operation ready to accept
the githyanki war machine with little resistance.<span>  </span>Several plots were hatched by Vlaakith’s
agents all over Faerun, but the most traction was to be had in the Moonsea, so
this is where her attention was eventually focused.<span>  </span>A rift was formed between the cities of
Hillsfar and Mulmaster, a task that did not prove too difficult.<span>  </span>The High Blade of Mulmaster ordered his city’s
navy to seize the mouth of the river Lis, which drains the Moonsea into the
Dragon Reach.<span>  </span>Hillsfar beseeched the
other Moonsea city, Zhentil Keep, for aid against Mulmaster, and a great ship
battle was in the making.<span>  </span>Just before
the fleets were to clash, high in the air a red dragon appeared.<span>  </span>Unknown to the soldiers below, the dragon
carried an amulet with a glowing orb.<span>  </span>A
gate opened up, and out flew the Lich Queen’s initial invation force; nine red dragons
and a fleet of steel flying ships filled with three thousand elite githyanki
warriors.<span>  </span>Both fleets of wooden ships
were burned to the waterline within the hour.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span>                </span>The
githyanki headed to Mulmaster where they were welcomed by the High Blade, possessed
as we was by Mist-of-the-Mind.<span>  </span>From
Mulmaster they seized Ironfang Keep and all the surrounding lands between the
Lis and the Earthspur Mountains, then moved north.<span>  </span>Aided by red dragons, the githyanki quickly conquered
Thar and pressed the humanoid population of that land into a great army moving
on the Moonsea.<span>  </span>Zhentil Keep, already
weakened by the loss of many ships, still had no choice but to field their
armies against the horde.<span>  </span>Unable to save
Melvaunt in time, the Zhentilar army met the horde at Phlan.<span>  </span>Their victory was the seed of their
defeat.<span>  </span>Having fielded their troops,
they left one of their principle fortresses, the Citadel of the Raven, relatively
lightly defended.<span>  </span>A small strike force
flew with the speed of dragons’ wings behind the Zhentilar, and more astral
gates were opened on the very walls of the citadel.<span>  </span>Ten thousand githyanki poured through and
took the fortress in the space of a few hours.<span> 
</span>Word reached the victorious Zhentilar generals in Phlan at about the
time that a long caravan containing the heads of Raven Citadel’s garrison reached
the gates of Zhentil Keep.<span>  </span>The message
had been sent; to oppose the githyanki meant death, yet the Zhents and their
leaders the Black Network of the Zhentarim did not give up so easily (and they
had as yet been given no choice), and prepared for an attack on their
city.<span>  </span>It was not a long wait.<span>  </span>Before the Zhentilar could return from Phlan,
the githyanki attacked, transported by their flying ships.<span>  </span>They quickly conquered the part of the city
on the south side of the river Tesh, but then paused.<span>  </span>In one night they sent the fastest of their
ships to Hillsfar, and attacked that city so ferociously that it came to be
known as ‘The Day of Vultures’ for the bodies littering the streets for scavengers.<span>  </span>The Zhentarim, hearing of this, were put into
the right frame of mind, so that when the githyanki emissary offered terms,
they were willing to give in to anything.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span>                </span>This
was well planned, for the Lich Queen and her chosen overlord for the githyanki
empire on Aebir-Toril desired to keep the Black Network and the forces of the
Zhentilar mostly intact but sufficiently cowed.<span> 
</span>The Zhentarim spies and agents would gather intel for the githyanki and
deal with other threats and potential allies against the illithid, like the
drow, while the Zhentilar soldiers would be a core force in what would become ‘The
Allied Companies’, natives of Toril who now fought on behalf of the githyanki .
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span>                </span>The
Moonsea region now conquered, the githyanki and their subject forces moved
south.<span>  </span>Certain areas were designated
neutral territory by the githyanki.<span>  </span>The
githwarriors were ordered not to slay any <em>graith</em>
(barbarians) in these areas.<span>  </span>The penalty
for disobeying this order was death.  Usually this was carried out by making the
offending warrior’s next mission a suicide mission.<span>  </span>The prohibition did not extend to the Allied
Companies, however, so some proxy actions were still carried out in these
areas, but for the most part the neutral territories were left alone in what
would become a widespread tempest of battles.<span> 
</span>Thus, throughout the Incursion, the Dalelands, Waterdeep, and certain
cities within lands that were otherwise fair game, like Raven’s Bluff in the
Vast, Neverwinter and Silverymoon in the north, Crimmor in Amn, and Elversult
in the Dragon Coast, did not feel the bite of silver swords.<span>  </span>The reasons behind this were in some cases
based on deals that certain powerful individuals, like Elminster, were given by
the Lich Queen.<span>  </span>The other major reason,
however, was to set aside places where espionage would be concentrated.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span>                </span>The
rest of Faerun was fair game.<span>  </span>The
githyanki and their spared allies first conquered The Vast and Procampur.<span>  </span>The githyanki fleet established a major
flying ship hub at lone rock in the Dragon Reach.<span>  </span>They then set their sights on the rich lands
of Sembia.<span>  </span>Part of the invasion of
Sembia included The Cult of the Dragon’s agents opening a portal to the
neg-energy plane to let through an ancient red dragon dracolich known as The
Claws of Death, and scores of undead and necromancers.<span>  </span>Tilverton was taken too, cutting off the
kingdom of Cormyr from the north.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span>                </span>After
Sembia, the pirate isles of the Sea of Fallen Stars were scoured, and every
pirate ship that desired not to be burned was herded west, to attack Westgate
and the Dragon Coast.<span>  </span>Meanwhile, the
dwarves of Ironfang in the Orsraun Mountains were attacked in order to secure
the githyankis’ alliance with the durregar of Dunspeirren against the illithid
city of Oryndoll.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span>                </span>Darkhold,
which had been taken over with the fall of the Zhentirim, had thusfar been a
brooding threat on Cormyr’s western flank.<span> 
</span>Zhentilar and githyanki forces issued forth to attack the Dragon Reach
from the west and the cities of the Lords’ Alliance.<span>  </span>Now that the Incursion was well underway,
however, these cities were considerably better prepared for the githyanki
onslaught than other lands had been, and Berdusk, Scornubel, Elturel, and Balder’s
Gate remained unconquered, and even retained a fair amount of control over the
roads in between, considering the githyankis’ superior tactical mobility.<span>  </span>Iriaebor was not so lucky.<span>  </span>Though the High Tower of Iriaebor remained
steadfast, much of the city was burned by the armies of Darkhold.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span>                </span>A
gateway to the south now open, the githyanki first attacked easy targets in
Tethyr and stirred up that land.  The Eyes of Amn were looking south when the githyanki seized the citidels in the Cloud Peaks of northern Amn.<span>  </span>Strategic strikes on the shipyards of
Calimshan ensured that land would look inward to their own defense rather than
try to aid their neighbors.<span>  </span>The
githyanki raided the rich lands of Amn, seizing much-needed resources for their
efforts throughout Faerun.<span>  </span>Throughout
the empires of the sands, and among the pirates of the Nelanther, all looked in
fear towards the night sky for githyanki raiders.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span>                </span>The
kingdom of Cormyr stood like a fortified island among the chaos engulfing
Faerun.<span>  </span>Dispite losing major battles at
the Bridge of Fallen Men, Thunder Pass, and Tilver’s Gap, the kingdom remained
steadfast, though isolated.<span>  </span>Its borders
may have been controlled by the githyanki, but the Purple Dragons and the war-wizards
of Cormyr kept their land safe, until a major invasion from the east.<span>  </span>Launched from a conquered Sembia, the forces,
mostly githyanki-allies, managed to take over the eastern part of the kingdom
but were stopped at Wheloon and the Wyvernflow.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span>                </span>In
addition to the major battles described above, there were hundreds of smaller
specialized actions throughout the realms.<span> 
</span>The flying ships of the githyanki allowed them to reach across Faerun in
a matter of days if they so desired.<span> 
</span>Many a dungeon or ruin saw small parties of githyanki who searched for magic
and gold, and secured numerous access points to Faerun’s underdark.<span>  </span>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
In fact, little known to those
facing the Incursion on the surface, an equally wide-ranging war was developing
deep underground. <span> </span>The githyanki enclave
of Gatchorof became a teeming military encampment with fresh swords from the Astral arriving constantly.<span>  </span>Deep beneath
Mulmaster, the githyanki brought war to the destrachans of Kuragolomsh,
eventually killing, or driving out the monsters, and mentally dominating their
largest specimen, ‘Ooorooee’, to forge a long spiraling tunnel to connect the “Eastern
Capitals” of Mulmaster above and Kuragolomsh below.<span>  </span>From these bases, they hunted the hidden
septs of the illithid throughout the underdark.<span> 
</span>The drow, a major force in Faerun’s depths, were bought off and paid to
hunt illithid heads.<span>  </span>The durragar, too,
were cultivated as allies for their hatred of the mind flayers, though they
remained untrusting of the Lich Queen’s servants.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
Throughout the underdark, in every
illithid sept, no matter how large or small, the githyanki searched for the
Sword of Gith.<span>  </span>The collected
intelligence evolved to reveal that the sword had indeed been taken by the
illithid centuries before.<span>  </span>The
loretakers of Oryndoll seized the sword long ago, but feared its power and
would not keep it in Oryndoll itself, hiding it instead.<span>  </span>Eventually, while other armies expanded
across the surface of Faerun, the githyanki under-armies zeroed in on their
prize.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
It was at a major battle, which
would become known as The Darkfields, that the githyanki finally found what
they sought.<span>  </span>They destroyed the strong
sept that guarded Gith’s Sword, but their victory was soon to be
short-lived.<span>  </span>Reinforcements from
Oryndoll, Ch’chitl, and the few other septs that had managed to survive the
githyanki onslaught surged up from the depths and threatened to over-run the
weakened githyanki forces.<span>  </span>Just before their
moment of looming defeat, however, the githyanki witnessed a miracle, and a
sign of great upheaval.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
On the astral plane, a strike force
from a prime world that had been caught up in the Lich Queen’s invasion (no one
is sure which one) successfully achieved the unthinkable.<span>  </span>No one is sure how, for there were no survivors,
but somehow they infiltrated the Palace of Whispers and destroyed Vlaakith and
her phylactery.<span>  </span>It is not really known
if they triumphed over the Lich Queen directly, or exactly how their victory
was won, but with her destruction (or whatever, since many githyanki believe
she will return) her final contingency plan was activated, and the void bombs
went off.<span>  </span>The ensuing destruction
engulfed Tu’narath and those cities and forts nearby, creating the largest
astral storm ever seen.<span>  </span>It continues to
rage, with psi/arcane fallout preventing any further investigation of the area.<span>  </span>The force of the void bombs ripped open the
planar barriers where Vlaakith had opened gates between the primes and the
astral, bringing untold destruction to the Incursion worlds and their githyanki
empires.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span>                </span>At the
Darkfields, the instant Vlaakith fell was noted in an entirely different
manner.<span>  </span>Those githyanki present, which
included members of the bands of Lapis, Lead, and Diamond, say that Gith’s soul
returned and entered into the junior officer charged with holding the Sword of
Gith.<span>  </span>Aided by the power of the
Liberator, and their own morale restored by Her return, they turned the tide of
battle against their foes and triumphed.<span> 
</span>They have since returned to the astral, and now call themselves “The
True”.<span>  </span>The young woman, now known as Ar-Gish
( &quot;The Great Gish, a way of saying Gith herself without using that name )
now leads a growing power bloc that believes in the War of Two Skies as
fanatically as it does the war against the illithid.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span>                </span>On the
Incursion worlds, many legions of githwarrios were trapped, for as a result of
the void bombs’ devastation on the astral their ability to plane-shift home was
disrupted.<span>  </span>Many have fled back to the
astral plane by whatever means they could.<span> 
</span>Many color pools between Varsh’isks and those astral cities and forts
well away from Tu’narath remained undisrupted.<span> 
</span>Others had to flee to the planes by other means, such as through Sigil.<span>  </span>Still, many githyanki remain, either trapped
without means of escape, or by their own choice.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span>                </span>On
Toril, the githyanki faced a revitalized opposition.<span>  </span>Many former allies who had been cowed by the
power of the githyanki and the Lich Queen turned treacherous.<span>  </span>Others remained loyal, or afraid enough, and continued
to aid the githyanki.<span>  </span>Now, after
Vlaakith’s fall, the githyanki empire in Faerun still includes Mulmaster and
much of the Vast.<span>  Their fling ships command the Sea of Fallen Stars from several bases in the Pirate Isles.  </span>Cormyr’s armies have
managed to reclaim their own territory and liberate most of Sembia, though
Daerlun remains in possession of the Cult of the Dragon, and the center of power of an ancient red dragon dracolich called The Claws of Death.<span>  </span>Githyanki also still control the citadels in the Cloud Peaks in northern
Amn, and have several small bases which
they launch flying-ship raids from in the Nelanther.  They have a small but growing power-base around Castle Spulzeer in the border
region between southern Anm and northern Tethyr, in alliance with a powerful human lich.  They also have a few secret villages in the Snowflake Mountains.  Thus they have all of Amn and Tethyr to raid with impunity. 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span>                </span>Their power
in the underdark was not as damaged as that aboveground, for they mostly used
existing color pools and gates to move there from the astral.<span>  </span>Gatcheroff is stronger than ever, and
Kuragolomsh, though initially damaged by void bomb rends, is now a very strong githyanki enclave in the north.<span>  </span>Hundreds of smaller fortifications and
weapons-caches have been established, and the depths below Faerun will feel the
marching boots of the githyanki for some time.
