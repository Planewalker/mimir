<p>Among the yugoloths, one of the worst fates possible was to have some especially unique ability, something that made a fiend stand out among his peers.</p>

<p>Perhaps, the grey-furred fiend thought as Yazakouris the Prophet literally collapsed on the steps leading into his fortress, that was what had made the two of them into such fast allies.  They were both, simply put, freaks among their kind – Yazakouris more than he.  He himself might be regarded as an eccentric and a firebrand, afflicted by an ability unique among his kind, but Yazakouris was simply crazy.</p>

<p>Over the many centuries, one or the other of them – most especially the Prophet – might well have been devoured by the intrigues of their kind, had their superiors not deemed them too useful to destroy. </p>

<p>That rankled.</p>

<p>Vashanhusur went through the motions of the usual protective magics before venturing outside into the frozen cold of his home plane.  One did not obtain the rank of arcanaloth without becoming justifiably paranoid – himself more than most.  Over millennia, numerous parties – some among his kind, but many serving other fiendish, celestial or even mortal interests – had attempted to slay, kidnap or otherwise inconvenience him.</p>

<p>He had the gates opened and stood at the top of the stairs, letting his eyes and posture indicate his displeasure.  Blood was dripping from Yazakouris’ fur into the snow.  Not enough, he judged, for him to worry that his closest ally might be mortally wounded.  All the same, he wasn’t well off.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Bel Aloth will rend my essence into bloody screaming bits and scatter it across the nether planes if you actually die on my doorstep.</span></p>

<p>“Have you <span style="font-style:italic">completely</span> lost your sense of decorum?”</p>

<p>“Oh, this?”  Yazakouris gestured weakly at himself, chuckling unevenly as he did.  “How easily I forget.”</p>

<p>“Your display of weakness is indecent and improper, not to mention a terrible example in the presence of your inferiors.”  Not only one of his nycaloth lieutenants, but even a number of lowly mezzoloths were watching them.  “Do something about it at once.”</p>

<p>“Hah.”  The Prophet seemed visibly to gather himself, to reach for some presence of mind, and moved his hands as he muttered a simple incantation.  To the naked eye, the rips in his robe mended themselves, the injuries simply disappearing as if he had never been wounded.  He could still smell the coppery-brimstone scent of Yazakouris’ blood, but decided not to press the issue.</p>

<p>Vashanhusur stood at the top of the stairs and waited.  The eyes of his unstable ally rolled and darted, unsteadily.  Finally, supporting himself with one clawed hand, the Prophet slowly wobbled to his feet.  The grey-furred arcanaloth smelled more blood as the movements put strain on his ally’s wounds.</p>

<p>“Better.  Yazakouris, called Prophet, be welcome in my home.”</p>

<p>                                            ***</p>

<p>The Prophet turned out to be relatively lucid for once, a fact that was a great relief to him.  He’d been certain that whatever had been the cause of Yaza’s injuries would have caused his mental state to deteriorate even more.</p>

<p>“What happened, Yaza?”  He’d had the Prophet lie down and bleed all over a couch in a side-room as he examined his ally’s injuries himself.</p>

<p>“Holy, holy sword.  Idiot with holy sword.  I was having a fit, Vasha, a beautiful vision, important for you to know.  Idiot almost killed me.”</p>

<p>“A terrible thing it would be, don’t you think, to be struck down by an idiot?”</p>

<p>His ally’s ears flattened against his skull.  “I can’t help it, Vasha.”  He knew the Prophet didn’t refer to this episode of the idiot with the holy sword, but rather to his own instability.</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose not.”  He offered his companion a goblet filled with freshly-drawn blood.  “Drink, recover your strength.  Fortunately, while your wounds are painful and debilitating, they won’t kill you outright – of themselves.”  This was the Plane of Pain.  Badly wounded creatures died, torn apart by rivals.  </p>

<p>“Wounds caused by highly consecrated weapons are very difficult to treat, but I know of at least one method that works quite well.  You’ll need to bathe in the blood and devour the flesh of several priests in the service of a holy deity – which means I can’t simply corrupt them first, and which incurs the additional risk of annoying a god and launching a personal crusade against us.  I’ll take care of it, but it will likely take weeks, perhaps months – during which time you’ll be completely vulnerable.  Where exactly did this idiot attack you?”<br />
	<br />
Yazakouris closed his eyes for a few moments.  “I was in the cave at the edge of the Purifcation Grounds of Nazatkira.  Kiasha cave.  I felt a fit coming on.  That cave is usually as safe as anywhere else.”</p>

<p>Vashanhusur fed more blood to the Prophet as he probed for details.  To his ears, it honestly sounded like one of the lone, foolish crusaders that mortals occasionally spawned.  They rarely succeeded in doing much damage.  This one mortal fool, though, had nearly managed to throw a brick into the ever-so-delicate mechanics that were the politics of the Wasting Tower.</p>

<p>It certainly gave weight to his long-held belief that mortals had personal, individual significance -- that some few of them, at least, were capable of cosmic influence.  Still, he would have been mortally embarrassed if his closest ally had actually been brought low by one of those pre-larval monkeys.</p>

<p>“Oh,” Yaza added softly, a sly expression sliding onto his face.  “I got something for you.  That I think you’ll like.”</p>

<p>“And what would that be?”</p>

<p>Twisting a little on the couch, he reached into an inner pocket of his bloody robes and withdrew something wrapped in silk.  Eventually he got it open, revealing a large, inscribed ruby that was very familiar to the other arcanaloth.</p>

<p>Yazakouris smiled softly.  “I had one of your little soul-catchers on me at the time.”</p>

<p>The Render smiled askance, his eyes glancing to the side, as he tried and failed to conceal his pleasure.  “In that, at least, you have done well.”  <span style="font-style:italic">Well, you certainly know how to bribe me, Yazakouris.  Spoiled cub.  Had you not the ear of Mydianchlarus himself, you and your only-too-accurate prophecies, someone would have ended your pitiable existence long ago.</span></p>

<p>Even imprisoned as it was, he could readily discern all sorts of details about the soul Yazakouris had brought him.  <span style="font-style:italic">A soul possessed of a powerfully offensive holiness</span>, he thought, after some observation, <span style="font-style:italic">and yet, not quite so holy as it thought it was</span>.  Not an <span style="font-style:italic">anima</span> of extraordinary interest to him, but one of high quality due to its potent holiness alone.</p>

<p>He took the gem.  “Thank you, my friend.  I’ll do what I can to find out what I can about this incident.  You said something about a vision…?”</p>

<p>The Prophet nodded, twice.  “Yes, yes.  Are you ready?”</p>

<p>Vashanhusur placed the ruby on a side table.  Yazakouris knew how disturbing it was, even to other yugoloths, when he spoke in his prophetic voice.  “I suppose so.”</p>

<p>The wounded yugoloth shut his eyes, attempting to relax as he reached into the corner of his mind where the latest revelation twitched and ranted.</p>

<p>“This is on some Prime world or other, I think you know of it though…”  Yazakouris spoke softly in his natural voice, before his body convulsed as if newly wounded and the voice altered.</p>

<p>It seemed nearly impossible that such a voice, akin to two stones grinding together, could emanate from the wounded fiend.  Even from such fiends as they were.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Mothers and their children embrace, and are destroyed.  A soldier clasps the arm of his brother in arms, and is destroyed.  The rich man touches the hand of a beggar, giving alms.  He perishes.  Men strike at one another in hate and are untouched.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">No plague of the body this, for such would be an impiety.  Mortal corruption engendering mortal corruption.  One mortal soul in need of our guidance.  A weapon is forged.  A new abomination is brought into the worlds.  One mortal race of lice destroys another.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">The liver of Prometheus is devoured.</span></p>

<p>Yazakouris fell so silent that, after a time, his ally felt obligated to check to make sure he was still alive.  The Prophet seemed all right, merely unconscious.  </p>

<p>The Baernoloths, the grim fathers of their kind, did not deign to communicate in any way with the yugoloths of lesser castes.  He would not be surprised if Bel Aloth were the plaything of one or another of them, but it would be absolutely heretical to suggest that a Baern would speak through the pitiable arcanaloth on his couch.  </p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Still</span>, he thought, <span style="font-style:italic">if not one of the ancient ones, I wonder who or what has made you its creature.  The fundamental essence of the Waste or of Gehenna itself, perhaps?</span>  Yazakouris didn’t have anything like the information network that would be required to fake the results he brought – not only did the Prophet routinely speak of things he couldn’t possibly know, he often spoke of matters even the most well-informed of his own race knew nothing about.  The upper echelons of the Wasting Tower believed in his prophetic voice, and that was enough.</p>

<p>He glanced again at the quiet figure on the couch.  <span style="font-style:italic">How dearly I loathe being compared to such as you. </span> Yazakouris was the mad visionary; he, the rationalist and implementor.  As ill-fitting as their personalities were, even he could not deny that their combined efforts tended to bring forth devastating results.</p>

<p>All of this would have to be reported in <span style="font-style:italic">some</span> fashion to Bel Aloth, a task he did not relish.  Vashanhusur suspected that his work would soon be needed here.  <span style="font-style:italic">One mortal soul, indeed.  No matter how grand we believe ourselves to be, how far beneath us they are, it always seems to come down to mortal souls.</span></p>       </div>

          The Prophet.        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><span style="font-style:italic">~State your name and your purpose.~</span></p>

<p>The mental ‘voice’ penetrated his thoughts in much the same way a flensing knife might penetrate flesh.  It was that painful and invasive. </p>

<p>He hesitated.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">#$#$#$#!!!!</span></p>

<p>His mind shied away from the pain.  It was difficult for him to dwell upon a pain as sharp and searing – and somehow, so very precisely administered -- as what he had just experienced.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">~I will make things very clear.  You are dead.  You are </span>dead <span style="font-style:italic">-- you have already gone through that gate through which all mortals must eventually pass.  When everything you ever knew or loved has passed away into nothingness, I will still be here.  You can either provide me with the answers I want, or I can torment you with agony beyond everything you have ever imagined in your mortal life.  I have a great deal of patience, and I have </span>no <span style="font-style:italic">limits.~</span></p>

<p>This was all wrong, so wrong – what had gone so terribly wrong?  He racked his brains, trying to recall what had happened.  His memories were jumbled.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">~Ah.~</span>  The pain lessened a little.  <span style="font-style:italic">~Finally we are beginning to get somewhere.~</span></p>

<p>He was <span style="font-style:italic">good</span>.  He was a righteous man.  He remembered this!  His god was a god of Light!  How was he trapped in this stifling, suffocating darkness?</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">~Yes, a paladin.  Of Tyr.  Of course.  How appropriate that such a warped little mortal should bind himself to that blind cripple.~ </span> The voice continued to violate him as it poked through his thoughts, and in some sense, through his very being.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">~Now, your name…~</span></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">You blaspheme!  O Just God, grant me strength!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">~(a light, sarcastic chuckle)~</span></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">~Your God is… not here.  How unfortunate.  I, however, am.~</span></p>

<p>Slowly, in no hurry, the speaker began to peel away the layers of his self and examined them, as if they were separate layers of skin.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Tyr!  Tyr, help me!  O Even-Handed One, if ever you helped me before, aid me now!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">(Incoherent screams)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">~How sweet… a rather crunchy, coarse texture, yet stable and solid.  A bit like oak.~  (Pause.)  ~You are, as I said, quite dead now, but you perished in such a manner that your spirit did not pass through the River Styx.  Thus your memories remain intact.~</span></p>

<p>Memories rushed out of him like gushing blood.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Images like those of a stage play, almost as if these events had happened to someone else.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">The Loviatan.  The Loviatan priestess.  She was beautiful – a very beautiful woman – but his faith and his training had taught him to resist temptation.  The Loviatan priestess who had corrupted so many in the city, starting with the most wealthy and powerful.  Finally she had been forced to flee, but he had sworn to bring her to Tyr’s justice.  He would chase her as far as he had to.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">~Clueless Prime,~ the voice remarked. ~ Amusing, though.~</span></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">She had thrown something at his head – some Loviatan instrument of pain – before leaping into the full-body mirror that served as a portal.  Stumbling, he had followed.   </span></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">He had come upon an utter wasteland of frozen snow and volcanic ash.  He contrived to survive for days as he followed the Loviatan’s tracks through the snow and ice, until a fresh snowfall obliterated them.  Kneeling, he prayed with all his heart for Tyr to guide him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Continuing his search, he began investigating a series of caves where he thought, perhaps, the Loviatan might have gone in search of shelter.  As he explored one of them, he could make out a most dreadful yapping and howling, and incomprehensible, babbled speech…</span></p>

<p>Well beyond the remaining senses of the trapped soul, his tormentor sniffed contemptuously.  “Yazakouris, you are really <span style="font-style:italic">such</span> a fool.  To have the unending centuries of your existence threatened by such a creature as this…”</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">He did not even recognize what the bestial creature was, the one that stared out at nothing and rent at its own tattered robes.  Every single one of his Tyr-granted senses screamed out at him – what an extraordinarily unholy creature this was.  It reeked of vileness and corruption…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">~Very well… Dolshen, is it, servant of the blinded cripple god we shall refrain from naming.  Allow me to introduce you to a harsh truth, one which the priests of your faith likely never taught. ~</span></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">~Even the souls of the most ‘worthy’ or ‘deserving’ do not always make it into paradise.  The reach of your ever-so-just god does not extend everywhere.  Sometimes, even heroic and noble souls suffer a damnation comparable to that of the most base villains they ever fought in life.~</span></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">~I have a very </span>special <span style="font-style:italic">use for just such souls as yours – shining, constant, holy ones.~</span></p>

<p>Dolshen’s agony diminished, though not – he thought with what little coherence remained to him – for long.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">~You are vaguely familiar with the concept of True Sight or True Vision, correct?~</span></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Oh.  Yes, of course.  (Puzzled.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">~While some misguided beings believe that truth conquers all, we know that simply isn’t the case.  Such spells may be induced to provide false results.  A villain may appear under ‘True Sight’ to be a priest or a commoner.  A righteous man may appear under magic to be a hated enemy.  As for you…~</span></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">~Certain items may be fashioned which can produce the effect I just described.  In order, for example, to make a wicked man appear under magic to be heroic, I require certain things – one of which is a mortal soul of unusual holiness.  Yours is in a raw state, and will require some processing, of course…~</span></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">~The thing I wish you most especially to know, while your memories of life still remain to you, is that everything you are – everything you hope and dream  and pray for – your most vital essence, that part of you which is sacred to the gods, will be used to do the work of Evil.  Your piety and faith and steadfastness will shield the wicked.  Everything you stand for shall be betrayed.  And so you will suffer and be able to do nothing, until the oceans dry up, the stars fall from the sky, and all has passed into dust…~</span></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

          The Prophet.        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><span style="font-style:italic">The Wasting Tower, Oinos</span></p>

<p>The floor squirmed slightly underneath his paw as he sank to one knee and stayed there.  Made of a grey-black substance halfway between stone and metal, and just slightly… <span style="font-style:italic">alive</span>, the very architecture of this room seemed to be trying futilely to get away from him.  In a small corner of his brain, the twitching flooring played on his predatory instincts – the feral part of his nature that urged tearing out throats and clawing out the guts of other beings -- which were exactly what he did <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> want right now.</p>

<p>He wondered why Bel Aloth had summoned him to this chamber, out of the dozens of vertical miles of rooms in the Wasting Tower.  He was very familiar with the centerpiece of the room, though:  a large flat table formed out of a hardened, largely undifferentiated mass of flesh, entrails and bones.  The Wasting Tower never suffered from any shortage of such spare parts for building materials.</p>

<p>Stretched out on its surface was a map.  It might have been drawn on a patchwork of tanned mortal skins rather than parchment, but it was still definitely a map.  Markers, made of metal and pieces of bone, had been placed here and there upon the surface.  He’d glanced at it as he had entered, but not had not recognized which world it depicted – which was a bit unusual in and of itself.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Very well, most likely she wishes me to draw a metaphysical map of some new world to corrupt.  Not unusual.</span></p>

<p>He sensed the ultroloth regarding him for a while.  After a period of time, the ambiguous, countertenor voice spoke aloud.  “You may rise, Render.”</p>

<p>He did so.  Bel Aloth demanded fewer overt shows of submission from him than from most arcanaloths, but that did not change the fact that the ultroloth’s foot might as well have been placed on his neck at all times.</p>

<p>Her appearance was not particularly different from that of other ultroloths.  Austere grey and white-grey robes sewn here and there with runes of great depravity and power.  Apparently completely sexless, as was the case with all ultroloths, his mistress was referred to as “she” – in languages that did not easily support the concept of malleable gender – much more often than the opposite.  It was all affectation with yugoloths, in any case.</p>

<p>A pair of apparently simple, geometric amulets were worn over the robes.  At the narrow, angular waist a pouch and a sheathed, slender dagger were visible.  He knew the latter was designed more for dissection and similarly fine work than for combat.  As for <span style="font-style:italic">real</span> bloodshed –</p>

<p>Vashanhusur had never, over all this time, been able to learn the full history and provenance of the sword sheathed across the ultroloth’s back, something he was eager to do.  As one of the premier weaponsmiths of the Lower Planes, he would have very much liked to know.</p>

<p>It was usually a lifeless steel grey in color, though he had seen it change through shades of grey and black before.  It was an enormous two-handed sword, balanced for the ultroloth who wielded it, but seemed to mass less than it should.  Even accounting for Bel Aloth’s incredible physical strength, it could change direction and momentum more easily than such a weapon should.</p>

<p>Any wounds it inflicted were virtually impossible to heal.  There was possibly something somewhere on the Planes that could heal such wounds, but Vashanhusur had yet to hear of it.  Additionally, if it struck any mortal creature, but did not kill it outright, the wounds it caused <span style="font-style:italic">invariably</span> became infected.</p>

<p>It greedily drank blood (or any fluid that belonged or once belonged to a living creature) – whenever exposed to it.  In many ways the sword appeared alive, but did not, to the best of his knowledge, contain anything that could be called a soul.  At least not the essence of any mortal creature.</p>

<p>For the most part, his mistress seldom had any reason to draw it.  Occasionally she had such cause, in one or another of the yugoloth civil wars when all facades were dropped and his kind slaughtered each other with vast enthusiasm.  During the ‘bloodless’ transition of power -- when Anthraxus had stepped down from the Siege Malicious -- it had been drawn multiple times.</p>

<p>Seldom did the Render feel hate for this being.  Perhaps across the centuries the day would come when he would assert his nature and Bel Aloth would die – struck down quietly and treacherously when least expected, perhaps.  Or violently and bloodily, the corpse torn apart, gloated over, devoured.  </p>

<p>Honestly, Vashanhusur desired neither outcome at the moment… quite the opposite.  For now, and likely for many long ages to come, he owed Bel Aloth the loyalty of a predator that recognized and acknowledged, <span style="font-style:italic">down to the very marrow in his bones</span>, a predator more powerful, advanced, and dominant than he was.</p>

<p>They spoke of the attack on Yazakouris.  </p>

<p>“I have been content in recent centuries to let the Prophet run about on a long leash.  It seems it is time to return to the choke chain.”</p>

<p>Carefully, using a verbal tense that indicated his submissiveness, he spoke.  “Surely you do not mean –“</p>

<p>“I do not plan to make him a permanent ‘guest’ of the Wasting Tower.”  That had turned out to be one of his mistress’ very rare errors of judgment.  For whatever reason, if Yazakouris stayed in any one place for more than a few decades or so, he lost his prophetic powers.  During his ‘stay’ in the Tower, his mental state had additionally deteriorated to one of total insanity of the useless sort.</p>

<p>The ultroloth glanced down at one of the bone markers at the table and moved it to a different spot.  “He would have not been in a position to be attacked in the first place, had he not slipped his minders.  Another arcanaloth I would have punished with severity, but such punishment would kill him in his current state.  He must be disciplined eventually, but for now, I shall simply constrain his movements and increase his guard.</p>

<p>“Have you any conjectures or opinions concerning this incident that you believe would interest me?”</p>

<p>“I have, of course, already made inquiries and performed divinations.  I believe any involvement on the part of the crippled god is peripheral at best – he seeks in general to destroy evil, but the Prophet seems to have been nothing more than a target of opportunity.  I am not so sure in the case of the Maiden of Pain.  I feel that there is something here that I cannot… justify rationally, but I think the involvement of the Loviatan priestess to be something other than chance.”</p>

<p>The ultroloth was silent for a few moments, most likely turning over the possibilities in her mind.  “I will bear this in my thoughts.”  </p>

<p>She beckoned him over to examine the map in more detail.  “A short time ago, a Prime mortal actually attempted to summon me.”  The ultroloth’s tone was one of scornful amusement; it was generally believed that the true name of Bel Aloth had never been discovered by <span style="font-style:italic">anyone</span>.  An incorrect name, apparently, had made its way into certain works that claimed to hold the true names of their kind.  That meant – unfortunately for would-be summoner – that one could indeed get Bel Aloth’s attention, but could not bind her.</p>

<p>As a matter of caste, ultroloths had few direct dealings with mortals, leaving such to lesser ranks – like his own.  Bel Aloth paid particular attention to this point of decorum and would generally smite those who attempted to invoke her name.</p>

<p>The ultroloth never actually slew them in person.  Perhaps the mortal would die, suddenly, of unknown causes, or would stab himself or throw himself off some high place, or succumb to a hideous disease.  But he would always perish in some painful and horrible manner.</p>

<p>“He yet lives.”  That surprised him.  “His thoughts and questions were of unusual interest.  The mortal is arrogant, but appears to be close to making a genuine discovery.  I do not object if the insects do the majority of our work for us.”  </p>

<p>The ultroloth examined the markings on the map once more.  “I intend to send you into this mortal realm to assist him in the final steps.  The words you claim the Prophet uttered make this matter a particularly urgent one.”</p>

<p>“Dread One, I would not dare to withhold or falsify…”</p>

<p>She waved his complaint away.  “You will go there in time, but for now, you will provide me with a metaphysical map of this world.  It is very isolated, as such things go, and has had comparatively little outer-planar involvement.  There is a noticeable paucity of information concerning this world in our records.”</p>

<p>Hence this room.  Vashanhusur had constructed the instrument (if not the room containing it) himself, wondering at the time if he were building the bars of his own cage.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">I cannot ascertain the minute details of individual souls from a distance; I must be physically present.  If some device were to allow me to see everything, in fine detail, via scrying, what would prevent Bel Aloth from imprisoning me in this tower until the multiverse is so much ash – or until we yugoloths are overcome by some younger, more vital race?</span></p>

<p>Via this device – only one of which existed, and which was, indeed, currently only metaphysically possible within the bowels of Khin-Oin – he could discern general metaphysical tendencies of Prime worlds.  Numbers of souls, general quality of souls, general cultural tendencies toward specific sins or virtues.  It was an invaluable tool when one wanted to examine a world’s overall potential for corruption.</p>

<p>A small bowl of blood, preserved by a commonly used anticoagulant, stood at one corner of the map.  He dipped one finger in it and began tracing a rune, slowly and repetitively, on the surface of the map as he closed his eyes.</p>

<p>As he began, the ultroloth projected to him details from the mortal’s mind to use as a reference point.  Zal Koth and a people called the Shorzanni were prominent…</p>

<p>“The focal points of this mortal’s compass are his own people, the orcs of Zal Koth, and his enemies, a human people called the Shorzanni.  Both civilizations are shot through with wickedness, but if I were to choose between them, the Zal Kothi are the more devoted to evil.”  Vashanhusur made notations in blood as he spoke.  “The Shorzanni contain a minority who are morally indifferent or even actively good – very few of these among the orcs.  On the whole, the Shorzanni are more prone to materialism, covetuousness, and enslavement; the Zal Kothi, to bloodlust, torture, and cannibalism.”  The word he used for ‘cannibalism’ simply meant the eating of intelligent mortal races, not others of one’s own race.</p>

<p>“In general, the Zal Kothi are more pious; many souls are already claimed by their patron god, Ilneval, and will not be easily wrested from him.  The Shorzanni follow something of a multitude of gods, but are more secular for the most part. Among both peoples, there are many souls that have been hardened by war, but the Zal Kothi have more of these, and on the whole they are more steadfast by nature.  Better than average Blood War fodder on this world.”</p>

<p>His eyes still closed, he reached over and tapped a specific spot on the map with one clawtip.  “Here.  There is an large, tight cluster of very bright, dynamic souls who possess what I have sometimes called the ‘Promethean spark.’  From what I have seen in the past, such clusters very often produce innovations or discoveries capable of causing meaningful change across many worlds, even the multiverse.  If this arrogant mortal is anywhere, he will be here.”</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><span style="font-style:italic">Somewhere on the Prime Material Plane</span></p>

<p>His attempt to summon Bel Aloth had failed.</p>

<p>Galaro had expected his attempt to result in one of three outcomes.  First, he would summon the mighty fiend and be able to control it or at least cajole it to do his bidding.  Second, he might have summoned it but have proven too weak to control it – a possibility which would have ended up with his flesh being reduced to ribbons of meat, and his spirit torn screaming into the underworld.  Third, the summoning might simply have failed explosively, creating a gate into the Lower Planes and a hilltop charred and permanently tainted by contact with Evil.</p>

<p>It had, he had thought, been almost disappointingly anticlimatic.</p>

<p>Nothing had happened.</p>

<p>He had almost believed, then, that the atheists were right, that neither gods nor fiends actually existed, that the damnable words were nothing but nonsense shouted into the void.  That the sacrifices he had performed – those of learned men of the Shorzanni – had been even more obscene because they were meaningless.</p>

<p>He had wondered if his momentary failure of belief had caused the summoning to fail.</p>

<p>Galaro, and his associate mages among the orcs of Zal Koth, had cut up what remained of the corpses of their enemies and fed them to the dogs.  In his own mind, he had crept away in shame:  he had pushed this particular project, and its failure would cost him face.</p>

<p>After the events of that night, he was not surprised to have nightmares afterward.  </p>

<p>It was their content that surprised him.</p>

<p>                                             ***</p>

<p>He was being watched.  More, he was being <span style="font-style:italic">observed</span>.  As Galaro and his brother mages had worked on the project, he had observed captive Shorzanni with the same detachment.  Not really detachment:  the kind of self-satisfied pleasure that one does not admit to, savoring the suffering of another while remaining separate from it.</p>

<p>The first night, he awoke sweating from his bed, staring out into the dark room, unable to get the image of those empty, inhuman eyes out of his head.  Just that – the eyes, and the sense of a vast, cold awareness.  An awareness that had focused on him.</p>

<p>                                          ***</p>

<p>The nightmares got worse.</p>

<p>He tried telling himself:  I should never have read that text.  My imagination is running away with me.  As a War College mage in Zal Koth, it’s hard not to become paranoid.</p>

<p>Flaying was not a particularly common punishment among the Beloved of Ilneval, but Galaro had seen one or two in his day.  As he slept, he dreamed of knives slicing into his flesh, with calm, deliberate care.  His wrists and ankles were tightly bound, he could tell that, but he couldn’t tell where he was.  He had been blindfolded as well.</p>

<p>That made it worse.  Where would the pain come from next?</p>

<p>He felt sure…fairly sure… that this wasn’t real, but even if it wasn’t, he knew he would be permanently scarred by the memory.  Mortals were never intended to survive being flayed alive with their minds intact.</p>

<p>                                         ***</p>

<p>Eventually, he awakened and proceeded to empty his stomach until nothing but bile came.</p>

<p>When he came back to himself, he realized he had voided himself as well.  Stumbling, still retching, he started to clean himself up.</p>

<p>He got the servants to change his bedding.  Beyond that, Galaro did little but stare at the ceiling for two days.  Impious as his brother mages were, there was talk of sending him to a priest, or at least a doctor, for the sake of his health.</p>

<p>On the third day, as he sat in bed, as he finished the soup and bread on a tray that a servant had brought him, a voice spoke.</p>

<p>“I am <span style="font-style:italic">so</span> sorry about that.”</p>

<p>The clipped, extremely precise enunciation of the voice reminded him of more than one War College master he’d learned from in the days of his apprenticeship, some years ago now.</p>

<p>Fully expecting the sight of some hideous fiend, he turned his head.</p>

<p>An orc sat at his desk, his arm leaning casually against the wood.  No, not really an orc.  The creature’s bearing exuded a total self-confidence Galaro hadn’t even seen in the priest-soldiers of Ilneval.  His thick black hair was worn long and elaborately braided like any War College master mage.  No proper orcish male of Zal Koth would normally use the word ‘handsome’ to describe another male, but this one was disturbingly handsome nonetheless.  Of middle age, he radiated a sense of refinement and prestige – qualities it would be difficult for any of his brethren not to admire.</p>

<p>“What?” he managed, feeling quite stupid at that moment.</p>

<p>The ‘orc’ sighed.  “Bel Aloth – and those of her caste in general – very rarely deal directly with mortals of any kind, for any reason.  Such is beneath fiends of their rank and power.  She normally annihilates mortals for such effrontery as yours, but the little… love tap you received was deemed sufficient for now, in your case.”</p>

<p>“Her…?”  He still felt stupid.</p>

<p>“Bel Aloth has always demonstrated a preference for that pronoun, yes.  In any case, your summoning didn’t fail… not quite.   I think the very notion you had of <span style="font-style:italic">binding</span> her is just wonderfully amusing, but at least you did get her attention.  Our attention.  It’s rare for either of us to be posed with a truly challenging intellectual problem, such as what you’ve dropped in our laps.  I’ve been sent to… help you and your brothers.”</p>

<p>“Who are you, then?  What are you?”</p>

<p>The not-orc smiled.  “I have several aspects, so it’s hard to say which would be most recognizable to you.  Even among my kind, I have something of a reputation as a researcher, which is why I am here and not someone else. I believe that you and your brothers are poised on the brink of a discovery -- one that will have lasting effects on your entire world.  Perhaps you could refer to me as ‘Creator.’”</p>

<p>                                          ***</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">I am nearly certain that these orcs of Zal Koth are descended from either shipwrecked or perhaps renegade scro.  </span></p>

<p>He was what he was.  He wrote down his observations.  </p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">They are quite clearly more intelligent and much more refined than the orcs of most of the Prime Material worlds we’ve encountered.  In Zal Kothi theology, Gruumsh has been overthrown in the ‘distant past’ by his lieutenant, Ilneval – a belief which neatly mirrors the triumph of reason over primitive tribalism. In that same tradition, they believe that their ancestors ‘came from the stars.’  Once I have more leisure, I will have to take apart a few and see how they compare anatomically to typical spacefaring scro, particularly with regard to the shape and complexity of the brain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Currently, their society exists in a state of conflict between the religious and secular.  The military and much of the government are – mostly – pious followers of Ilneval and make an effort to follow his teachings.  However,  since their earliest days on this world, the Zal Kothi have always had a social class of intellectuals, primarily arcane practitioners, to whom the others  turn for advice.  Ironically, while their all-consuming war against the Shorzanni has made the bulk of the population more conservative, this class of intellectuals is leaned upon more heavily than ever.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">The currents of magic are stronger than average on this world, and no arbitrary restrictions on the use of the Art (i.e., ‘Mystra’s Denial’ and the like) exist.  Ironically, since this world’s peoples are relatively young in their development, much of this potential is currently untapped.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">I like these clever orcs.  Given a chance, I think I shall preserve them as a people – for a few centuries at least. </span></p>

<p>Thinking, he absently wiped blood and bits of skin from his stylus.  He was going to have to come up with a very solid justification for that to Bel Aloth.  The ultroloth was as serenely indifferent as an ocean or an earthquake.  He liked the Zal Kothi because they were different; they were novel, and interesting, and would preserve him from boredom for a while.  At his age, that became more and more important.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">
