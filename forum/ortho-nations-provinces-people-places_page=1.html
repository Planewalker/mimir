         <p>The 1 through 17 was more a convinent marker for us as we talked about them. It's easier to say #3 than to say "Um, that place between the squiggle on the coastline and..." It's a shorthand for the developers very much NOT intended as the names in the end. As each area gets defined with real names I'm updating the photoshop copy of the maps I have. The names on my list noted above *are* the ones I've currently got listed for those provinces. Some of those names are the same as the old nations (500 years is a long time but not long enough to forget that a land used to be called something.)</p>

<p>As for creating a new subforum for it - I debated on that actually. The main reason I haven't is because I don't see the forum being used so much once the release is wrapped up. And a dead forum is a sad sad thing indeed.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

          Ortho: Nations, Provinces, People, Places        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Ok I've been doing some work to form a framework for the colonies of the harmonium off of Ortho on other planes.  Here is what I have come up with for a start at classification.</p>

<p>Types of Colonies</p>

<p>Re-reading the threads I'm thinking more in terms of a Roman-like expansion for the Harmonium.</p>

<p>Provinces - Full members of the Harmonium with full citizenship to anyone born and living in them.  These provinces send representatives to the Octave Council and etc.  Currently, no provinces exist off of the prime world of Ortho.  This is a slowly smoldering bone of contention in many of the off-world colonies, which want equal rights.</p>

<p>Integrated Colony - A supposedly full member of the Harmonium without representation on the Octave council.  Otherwise these colonies are almost fully self-ruled, following the doctrines and codes of the Harmonium.  Their governments still answer to the Octaves but otherwise they are independent and for the most part equal in the written law of the Harmonium.  Those born in these colonies are considered citizens of the Harmonium, but there is a social distinction between an 'Ortho' citizen and an 'Outer' citizen.  Still trade between Ortho and the Integrated Colonies is very important and tends to bring more into Ortho than goes out to the Colonies, but the imbalance is only a slight one.  Furthermore, integration is supposed to be a transitional state between organizing and becoming a province.  In theory an integrated colony that shows its government can keep harmony and control of order for a certain length of time should automatically become a province.  During the colonization of Ortho this period was between ten and fifty years.  However, there are several off-world colonies that can claim integration for over 50 years, but have not been granted province-hood due to arguments and repeated calls for examinations to prove that they have truly been harmonious in those years.</p>

<p>Petitioning Colony - These are the colonies that are petitioning to be recognized as able to self-govern themselves fully (to become an Integrated-Colony) and are often allowed to establish limited self-government, and even legislative bodies.  People born in a Petitioning Colony do not automatically gain citizenship in the Harmonium but they are able to apply for citizenship with 'considered approval'.   This means that in theory they should be given citizenship quickly after they go through the application process unless a specific reason is raised as to why they should not be allowed citizenship (the perspective citizen is considered worthy of being a citizen unless evidence can be brought to show the contrary).</p>

<p>Organizing Colony - In the letter of the law there is no difference between Petitioning Colonies and Organizing Colonies other than the former is actively working to become integrated fully into the harmonium.  In practice the organizing colonies are those that are still considered too chaotic to be allowed self-rule; while petitioning colonies are often allowed to establish minor self-governments in order to ease the transition between being organized and being integrated.  Technically, all petitioning colonies are classified as organizing.  Also like a petitioning colony those born in organizing colonies should be able to gain citizenship with just going through the application process however, in practice the burden of proof is put on the applicant rather than on those who would object to their application.</p>

<p>Ward Colony - These are organizing colonies that have backslid into chaos.  Those that have gained stability but have for one reason or another shown that they need more 'help' to become harmonized and that they are far from being able to self-govern.  Martial law is held in all major cities of these colonies and their outer regions are often lawless, or even in open rebellion.</p>

<p>Sponsored Territory - These are places and prime worlds that are being brought into the Harmonium.  In order to become a colony the perspective territory must be introduced for approval to the Octave Council.  Thus they must be sponsored by one of the provinces.  Once sponsorship and approval has been granted the area becomes a sponsored territory and is considered to be part of the Harmonium.  People born in sponsored territories may apply for Harmonium citizenship and use their status of being born in a territory as claim to eligibility for citizenship, but they must also prove that they are worthy on their own merits for their application to be approved, a long and arduous process.</p>

<p>Holding - This is territory under the Harmonium's control that is not seeking or being given sponsorship for one reason or another.</p>

<p>Outside Territory - This is any territory not yet within the Harmonium.</p>

<p>Rebel Colonies - The last category is one that is unofficial, at least for the lower echelons of citizens in the Harmonium.  These are the few colonies that have taken to order, but have split from the harmonium.  Normally when a rebellion occurs the colony or territory is simply down-graded to the appropriate level, generally a ward colony if the rebellion is wide spread, or to an outside territory if the Harmonium has lost control.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

I'm still trying to grok all that's been written so far...Trying to follow the three primary Ortho threads is a bit confusing; for instance, trying to figure out what relates to the past and what relates to the present...I've downloaded the pdf, but it's the 22 page one and a lot has been written since then...It would be nice to see a 'to do' list so as to show what has been achieved and what needs to be done, preferably by the project co-ordinator (which I assume to be you, Clueless)...It's a great project idea with some exceptional ideas submitted, if a bit scattered in scope...I like the fact that it's pretty much fluff and little stat oriented [as I'm still playing 2nd ed. and don't plan to convert to 3.5 <img src="http://planewalker.com/sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/wink.png" title="Eye-wink" alt="Eye-wink" class="smiley-content"/> ]...</p>

         <p>Ok, a bit of a summary then - the threads from start to current:</p>

<p>The initial project thread to select the map to use:<br />
[url=/forum]<a href="forum_.html">/forum</a>]<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold"><br />
Then we needed to work out the background:<br />
[url=/forum]<a href="forum_.html">/forum</a>]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Then, once we had our history structure we're working on people and places:<br />
[url=/forum]<a href="forum_.html">/forum</a>] (The one we're on right now)</span></p>

<p>There have been a few thread branches to gather up ideas for plot points later, or specific locations that people have started up. I'll bump them when their turn comes around to get worked on - for example, after this thread topic is mostly done we'll move into the plot points. That thread will have a link back to the previous two big threads and this one will have a link to it.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Right now this thread is the leading point of development. </span>The first post on this thread covers the critical background information. The two listed in bold are what I'd say are the 'main' threads to be read up on. And yeah, you're right on whose doing all the coordination - I've taken on the title of Cat Herder for the month. <img src="http://planewalker.com/sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/wink.png" title="Eye-wink" alt="Eye-wink" class="smiley-content"/></p>

<p>I really need to get the new PDF out but that won't be for a few more days from here - I don't have adobe's PDF generator on my machine here at home. What I'm doing with the threads here is keeping track of the ideas that get tossed out, and trying to stitch together enough of a coherant dialogue that we can keep ourselves on track. (For example, all threads related to the Ortho project I've editted so their title is Ortho: something, to make an attempt to have them easy to locate.)</p>

<p>As for our current to do list:</p>

<p>From the previous thread:<br />
<span style="font-style:italic"><br />
How did the alliance with the beholders come about? Was it as simple as make a deal to destroy the elves and that was it or was there anything special involved.</p>

<p>We still need to detail the background origins of the Schism, the Harmonium's civil war.</p>

<p>We could use at least a few further details on the War of Iron - the failed attempt to destroy the Abyss.</p>

<p>What sorts of things have leaked in from the planes that the Harmonium didn't want to see leaked?</p>

<p>And are there any signifigant names in history that we want to include.</span></p>

<p>From the current thread:<br />
<span style="font-style:italic"><br />
Each province needs a writeup - preferably one as detailed as the beholders have gotten, with people, places, culture and provincial governments laid out.</span></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Well, I've reconsidered my beholder nation a bit after reading the pdf.</p>

<p>In my new conception, the beholders are meaner than in the old.  Most grell are still unrestrained from eating humanoids; the beholder capital is a secret place deep in the Flamedance Mountains (same setup, extinct volcano).  The village on the volcano rim is no longer a large metropolis of humanoids but rather a small village of aboriginal gnome beholder cultists living in a shamanic culture.</p>

<p>Despite the xenophobia of the Eye Tyrants I say that they HAVE to be more unified than average beholders.  If the beholders were constantly at war with their mortal enemies (the beholders) then they could never band together and make a collective pact with the Harmonium.</p>

<p>I don't have my MM so if someone could send me a pdf or jpeg copy of the beholder (and gauth stats) stats (its actually legal since I own an MM) I could work on some stattage.  Was thinking about a beholder Master of the Unseen Hand NPC.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Ack - ok - I shall update the docs to reflect that. You may want to switch the gnomes to humans or dwarves. Gnomes are on that list of 'currently extinct' from the Factol's Manifesto. Though I suppose if they were kept in *complete* isolation by their beholder masters... </p>

         <p>Oh.  How about Orcs and Half-Orcs?  I didn't realize gnomes were extinct too...</p>

<p>We could compromise.  Have two major Beholder "cities".  Coldash as the secret home government of the beholders - off limits to all but the most priviledged humanoids.  And then something more metropolitan, a coastal city carved by beholder eye rays from a cliff-side and composed of all races. </p>

<p>And we could have the beholders be more LN... secretive, reclusive, quick to anger.  I just thought that my first writeup was counter to the original idea.  The grell can mostly be tamed...</p>

<p>Beholderkin:</p>

<p>Deathkiss:<br />
Alien creatures, deathkiss beholderkin are unrecorded in Ortho.  This doesn't mean you won't see one, just that you may not survive to tell the tale.</p>

<p>Director:<br />
Grell flesh-sculpted servitor beasts.</p>

<p>Eyeball:<br />
Naturally occurring beholder variant... create hives in caverns and trees.</p>

<p>Eyes of the Deep<br />
- Mythical creatures even to the beholders, the Eyes of the Deep dwell in the dark underground oceans where even beholders fear to float....</p>

<p>Gauth - Two types.<br />
- Civilized; legally seen as equal to beholders, the civilized gauth are mostly seen as a seperate lower class of beholders and form secretive clans and communities within beholder lands.<br />
- Degenerate; degenerate gauths roam the cavern networks of the flamedance mountains like ravening monstrosities.  Beholder lore states that these mad gauth are outcasts, cursed during the Great Victory.  They barely speak and seem to only exist to cause mayhem and amass hordes of ill-gotten wealth.</p>

<p>Gouger<br />
-Horrifying beasts created during the Great Victory, Gougers beholders are slapdash abberrant monstrosities who roam unprotected throughout the Underdark.  The forces of the Beholder Nation have exterminated most Gougers and driven the remaining ones deep into the earth.  However, adult beholders still tell tales to their offspring about hordes of horrifying Gougers deep beneath the world -- tales that may have more truth in them than is commonly assumed.</p>

<p>Hive Mother-<br />
Unheard of on Ortho.  Possibly driven to extinction by beholders early in history.</p>

<p>Overseer<br />
-Created by grell fleshsculptors, Overseers are "owned" by beholders as guards and wardens (even in this day and age, the beholders hardly trust each other).  Overseers are completely unable to affect their "owner" with their domination ability and follow orders without hesitation.</p>

<p>Spectator<br />
- Grell built servants who have since been discontinued.  Spectators were created with too much intelligence and will.  Many were destroyed, others were given freedom (but, of course no vote).  Spectators can be found in other Orthan cities, but they have no role in the "beholder warren" social system.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Will do. I've inserted the beholderkin list to the doc, and if you want I can edit through the rest of it for the new view on the beholder personality for you - up to you if you want me to revise, or want to revise for yourself whats in the doc (as is currently in the newly uploaded PDF). </p>

         <p>The beholderkin list seems good to me, with two caveats:</p>

<p>1. I think any large group of beholders <span style="font-style:italic">needs</span> hive mothers in order to hold together. Overseers can do this as well, of course, but hive mothers have the ability to control even overseers, and thus get larger communities. Without the hive mother/overseer combo, beholders, beholder-kin, and beholder abominations tend to try to kill one another. Plus, at least in 2e all beholder abominations were created by hive mothers, who couldn't reproduce on their own.</p>

<p>2. Spectators are native to Mechanus. I've been meaning to write an ecology thing figuring out how they relate to observers, who are also beholder-kin native to the planes of law.</p>

<p>I like the idea that Orthoan beholders are red, chitinous, and spiky, and quite possibly the primary inspiration for Harmonium armor. They've united to wipe out any who look too different from this standard (freakish abomination castes who couldn't possibly look like this excepted, of course - but both the Hive Mothers and common beholders will have red, chitinous plates).</p>

<p>I don't think Orthoan beholders are less xenophobic than those on other worlds; they've simply reduced themselves down to a single nation/species with a relatively low degree of morphic variance - probably with the help of humanoid Hardhead troops aiding them in exterminating beholder nations who wouldn't cooperate in the Brave New Harmonium Order.</p>

<p>Hive mothers in general are good for making large, unified beholder groups. However, the ultimate leader(s) of the Flamedance beholders doesn't necessarily need to be a hive mother; it merely needs to have the aid of a lot of them in controlling and pacifying the rest.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Really?  I HATE the Hive Mother.  I find it a really dumb uninspired creature.  "How can we get beholders to work together when they hate each other?  Oh, right, monsters who frce beholders to work together"</p>

<p>It doesn't even charm other beholders, it dominates them... domination that ends as soon as a beholder is in view of another one due to the antimagic eye.  I think its a silly tacked on concept that I have intentionally done away with because a society of creatures who hate each other held together by a single creature (or number of creatures) who force them to cooperate using mental domination is silly and, frankly, I'd rather rework beholder civlization (Ortho specific) than include them as anything more than random aberrations.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>The way I see it, they only need to use their <span style="font-style:italic">domination</span> ability occasionally; beholders being lawful creatures, they learned to accept the hive mothers' rule eons ago. The <span style="font-style:italic">domination</span> effect gives the Mothers a weapon against truly recalcitrant inferiors, but generally speaking their presence is authority enough.</p>

<p>The difference between "civilized" beholders who live in complex hives with many morphologically distinct castes and lone beholders who consider all others of their kind to be rivals and enemies is the hive mothers. <span style="font-style:italic">But</span> it isn't the <span style="font-style:italic">domination</span> ability that makes this true - the beholders who live in hives obey their superiors <span style="font-style:italic">and</span> their superiors have the ability to force them to do so, not <span style="font-style:italic">because</span> they have this ability. Beholders have been living in hives for a very long time, quite possibly since the creation of their race. These beholders are civilized because they're civilized - the hive mothers, overseers, and their <span style="font-style:italic">domination</span> are almost a side-effect of the civilization rather than the other way around, or would be if they hadn't come about basically simultaneously.</p>

<p>Now, if you really <span style="font-style:italic">really</span> hate hive mothers, I don't actually have an objection to going a different route. I mean, go ahead, there's room for many different kinds of beholder societies in the multiverse, and creativity is good. But I like them, personally; I think they fill an important and interesting role. Not one that couldn't, with a little creativity, be replaced, but they exist and they work well enough as they are.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>This is a teaser of what I've been working on for the colonies of the Harmonium.  I'll post more once Clueless splits the thread which should be sometime tommorow.</p>

<p>The first jewel is a prime world known as Intagril and counts itself as the first world to accept Harmony after Ortho.  </p>

<p>The world was already in revolution when members of the Harmonium found their way to the sphere with two great nations feuding over control of the sphere, the nation of Sea and the nation of Sky.  Both Sea and Sky had powerful clerics and wizards with spells and artifacts able to wreak terrible destruction upon the world.  All out war seemed inevitable, with new skirmishes flaring up every day across the borders of the great nations.</p>

<p>Sea and Sky were both possessed wise rulers and a great palace was built between them to negotiate.  It had staved off war for a hundred years but year by year the agreements and compromises have been fewer and each harder made than the last.  Negotiations regularly broke down and fears were growing across the world that the end of their world was coming through a horrific world war that would destroy all in its path.  </p>

<p>Then a lone disciple of the Harmonium, who refused to give his name or ever show his face began to appear on the borders of these two nations, calming all the conflicts that he met as he traversed the plane, making his way to the great palace.   Even as word of his story and words spread through both the nations things degenerated and when the figure stepped first into the Palace of Negotiation the walls of the palace had already been cracked from the first salvos of what was to be all out war, and the ambassadors were all starting to flee.  </p>

<p>He stood in the palace hall and spoke in a voice as loud as thunder but as smooth as the flow of water in a calm stream.  The armies stopped their advance on one another instantly, soldiers with blades drawn ready to strike.  And the ambassadors were drawn back to the hall.  </p>

<p>For a week the figure calmly spoke of Harmony, his words traveling on all the winds from the palace to reach almost every ear of that world.  He gave no orders.  He took no side.  He spoke not of either nation, but his words were applicable to all.  Then after the eighth day just as the sun dropped below the horizon the figure fell silent, having brought his speech to a finish.  </p>

<p>A young girl and a young boy, who were attendants of the hall working to serve the ambassadors the girl from sky and the boy from sea approached the figure, offering him food and water.  He ate, drank and then walked from that place and disappeared, never seen again on the plane.  At dawn on the next day, the two rulers of the nations stepped into the hall just as the ambassadors awoke.  Only the two children had witnessed the figure leaving.  By sunset of that very day, the unification of that world had been agreed upon.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I'm not sure if the following questions from the "Ortho: the Beginnings" thread were answered, so I thought I'd repost/bump them here:</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;ripvanwormer&#039;</em> wrote:</div><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;Fidrikon&#039;</em> wrote:</div>a couple ideas- was it mentioned in the Factols manifesto if the Harmonium Factol was the Leader of all Harmonium, or just the Commander of Harmonium actions on the Planes?</div></p>

<p>I'm not sure if it specified. I like <a href="http://oracle.wizards.com/scripts/wa.exe?A2=ind0211A&amp;L=PLANESCAPE-L&amp;P=R1919&amp;I=-3" class="bb-url">Richard Gant's theory</a>:<br />
<div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>The Harmonium is ruled by Ortho.  The Factol is a member of Ortho's Octave Council.  The Factol has always been a member of the Octave Council. Despite the relative populations of Ortho and the Harmonium of the Planes (Ortho has a population of about 2 billion;  it is *estimated* that Arcadia alone has fifty times as many members of the Faction, and there are more scattered throughout the Outer, Inner, and Prime planes), Ortho considers their Outer Planar holdings to be nothing more than a colony. The official title of the "colony leader" is Governor-General.</div></div><br />
Two billion seems like a rather high population, especially given the apparently small proportion of land to sea on Ortho...Could they possibly feed that many people with a pseudo-medieval/early-renaissance technology?...Thoughts?...Also, if Arcadia has 100 million Harmonium, certainly it should be considered less of a colony and more of a province...I mean, it certainly is the most harmonious place in all the (outer) planes...Thoughts?...Also, I was wonderin' what you folks think alignment and racial percentage make up of all Ortho is?...And, as a last question, I noted that the merfolk are mentioned in the creation myth; are they still around and, if so, why not make them a province, perhaps a Province of the Underseas? Well, that seems like enough questions for now, although I'm sure I'll come up with a few more as that's what I'm good at...<br />

         <p>I'd consider the tech level to be more like early Industrial Revolution, myself, with airships and steam-powered war machines, factories, and looms. It was medieval 500 years ago when the Harmonium began, but with the resources of an entire world and dozens of colonies it's advanced. Because it's D&amp;D, swords and the most primitive firearms are the best they can do as far as hand-held weapons are concerned.</p>

<p>That doesn't mean the 2 billion figure is accurate. We could have a vote.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

          The Province of Hazhkan        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><span style="font-style:italic">Okay, I know I'm selfish, writing up a </span>second<span style="font-style:italic"> province when a lot of people haven't even set up a first one, but I got on a roll and decided to throw out the result.  This is Hazhkan, AKA "location #4" on the Big Map.  Works out sort of as a fantasy Kiplingesque India, though there's certainly other flavors of imperialism present as well - one of the places that the Harmonium's still establishing itself in.</span></p>

<p>On the western edge of Ortho's largest continent lies the tropical province of Hazhkan.  A low-lying land, criss-crossed with fens, jungles and huge tracts of bramble and vine, Hazhkan is a place that has only recently been claimed by the Harmonium.  Great cities and prosperous farmlands have been carved out of the wilderness, but much of the land is still uncharted and its inhabitants remain blind to the guidance of Law.  Decades of work remain yet to be done here, and heroes can make their names many times over in the service of the Harmonium.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Geography</span></p>

<p>Hazhkan stretches for nearly two thousand miles along Ortho's equator, and nearly half that distance north to south.  Three words are almost entirely sufficient to describe the entirety of Hazhkan's geography and climate - flat, wet, and hot.  Soft, rich sediments allow plants of all kinds to flower and flourish, and abundant rains cause shallow lakes and slow, silt-choked rivers to form throughout the countryside.  The tangle of plants and streams make maps of Hazhkan difficult to scribe at best - the very shape of the land changes from season to season, with jungles spreading and new riverbeds being carved out of the land with each new year.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Settlers</span></p>

<p>The masters of Hazhkan, at least in their own minds, are the Harmonium-sponsored settlers who have come to the land in the past few centuries since the unification of Ortho.  As a backwater wilderness, Hazhkan was never considered to be much of a bastion of chaotic forces, but the will of the Harmonium is not to be denied - all of Ortho shall be unified under the rule of Law.  Those worthy souls who have chosen to come to Hazhkan know themselves to be the forefront of a new order, bringing enlightenment to a land which has never known anything but savagery.  They are willing to do almost anything in order to further the Harmonium's mission and purpose.</p>

<p>Hazhkan's settlers have built many cities and fortresses of stone, and cleared what land they can to plant rice, grains and other crops.  Their work has not always been completely successful - tropical heatwaves have caused many a crop to wither in the fields, insect plagues and diseases have caused much death and hardship, and at least three cities have been abandoned after flash floods tore at their centers, leaving only waterlogged ruins behind.  Still, the Harmonium settlers persist.</p>

<p>And the newcomers have found valuable resources in this land.  Gold is one of the most obvious ones, panned in rivers and streams across Hazhkan.  Tropical fruits, inks and dyes, hardwoods, and exotic furs also come from this land, along with more mundane goods such as soft coal, shale and limestone, and salt.  Such items are traded to neighboring provinces, and bring in the extra food, cloth goods and metalwork that the settlements of Hazhkan need to survive.</p>

<p>Settlers in Hazhkan are of many races.  Humans are most common, of course, from a myriad of provinces, but Motmurk orcs are also prevalent, eager to test their strength against the challenges of this unknown land.  These souls have been lectured on the need to transfer their loyalties to their new homeland and not hold any needless attachment to their old lieges in Motmurk, but whether this has been truly accepted by all is not yet clear.  A few beholders have also come to Hazhkan - most common in the east, but valued everywhere for their magical talents and engineering abilities.  And finally are the rakshasa - tiger-men, and unknown elsewhere on Ortho, but powerful, well-suited to Hazhkan's hot, muggy climate and devoted to the spread of Law.  The rakshasa are not yet wholly trusted by the other people of Hazhkan, but still considered valued allies in a dangerous land where civilization itself is an uncertain thing.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Natives</span></p>

<p>Though Hazhkan is not an easy place to live in, it still has a large population of native people.  Savage folk who dwell in the marshes and jungles, surviving as best they can as hunters and gatherers, the Hazhkan natives live short, dirty and brutish lives.  Might makes right, No one who sees the squalor in which they live can doubt the good intentions and divine right of the Harmonium.</p>

<p>Some of the Hazhkan natives are slowly but inexorably being civilized.  They've been brought into the new cities, taught to till the land and sell their goods at market, their histories recorded in writing and their tribal gods replaced with the worship of the Lord of Law.  For a few of the tribes, this is progressing well.  One shining example of this are the river nomads of the Qijari delta.  They have been easily assimilated into the Harmonium, bringing their skills at crafting light boats and carving wood along with them, and prospered greatly.  Their numbers are easily twenty times what they were a century ago, and indistinguishable from people of other lands save for their dusky skins and the odd facial tattoos they preserve as a mark of their past.</p>

<p>Many other tribefolk have not yet been so fortunate.  They have proven unable to keep up the sustained labor needed to farm the land or practice a trade in the cities, and have drifted into peonage or begging for charity.  Such an outcome is unfortunate, but the Harmonium was not built on forcing the industrious to feed the indolent; those who have wasted their first chance at prosperity must find their own way thereafter.</p>

<p>Several institutions have been created to bring discipline to the savages.  The temple-farms of the southwestern coast take on any who will come, teaching discipline and exacting hard labor in the fields in exchange for food and shelter sufficient to live - not an easy life, but a longer one than a landless beggar might otherwise possess.  The monastic compound at Aj-Rakaith accepts orphans, foundlings and other young children for instruction, but can only accept a few and often has problems with children who think they have some right to remain with their families.  None of the institutions in Hazhkan are perfect, but all are better than letting the savages remain unenlightened.</p>

<p>Even with centuries of progress, there are still a few of the native tribes who have not heard the word of the Harmonium - or refuse to listen.  These unbelievers hold to the deepest swamp, the most tangled jungle, and resist any who would challenge their isolation with fire, wood and stone.  Their miserable resistance is not so important that the Harmonium must seek to destroy them outright - time will suffice to spread Law across all the land.  The one exception is when a tribe of marsh halflings is discovered, for a few remnants of this race of chaos-friends still dwell within the unmapped depths of Hazhkan.  News of a surviving pocket of halflings raises the Harmonium's full ire.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Kingdoms</span></p>

<p>Many kingdoms, districts, colonies and petty empires rise within the province of Hazhkan.  Some were founded by outsiders who came to the land in the first days after the coming of the Harmonium, an enlightened noble class who set themselves as protectors and lieges of the native folk of a certain area in anticipation of later reward.  Others are pure colonies, inhabited entirely by outsiders and granting citizenship only to those natives who demonstrate an understanding of and acceptance of the rule of Law.  A few kingdoms are even ruled by natives directly - Qijari is one such.</p>

<p>Each of the kingdoms of Hazhkan obeys the dictates of the Octave Council and holds to its laws, but also establish their own dictates and preserve their own customs.  Kingdoms collect taxes and fees, recruit soldiers and officials to serve the Harmonium's will, and enforce the code of the Harmonium within their own borders.  Representatives to the Council of Ortho are named through a series of contests - one chosen through a tournament of arms, one with a test of wits, learning and oratory, and one through a display of master craftsmanship.  Each kingdom may name up to three candidates for the great contest when a position on the council opens, but only one person in all of Hazhkan can hope to win.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Monsters</span></p>

<p>Creatures of many kinds dwell in the jungles and swamps of Hazhkan.  Most are dumb beasts - hydras, basilisks and carrion crawlers, destrachan and swamp krenshar, oozes and monstrous vermin.  The larger and more dangerous of these creatures have been beaten back from the settled lands, but a few still raid outlying fields and towns.  Punitive raids are sometimes conducted to discourage such attacks.</p>

<p>More dangerous are the flights of gargoyles and bands of minotaurs and jungle trolls who still call the depths of Hazhkan home.  Like the less intelligent monsters, these creatures have lost much to the Harmonium - but their cunning has allowed them a better chance to survive, and bred a hatred of the new arrivals and all their works.  They raid against the new kingdoms when they can, which is not often - an organized soldiery is well able to drive back such attacks, usually with heavy losses.  Still, even the little damage that they do is more than the Harmonium would like to see.</p>

<p>Greatest of all the creatures of Hazhkan, though, are the mighty dragons.  Such creatures have dwelled in the jungle since the earliest of days, and are a force that not even the Harmonium and the Lords of Law can dismiss lightly.  Some kinds of dragons - greens and bronzes, for instance - are inclined to favor the dictums of the Harmonium, and have even made common cause with it.  Others, most notably the black wyrms of the swamps, oppose its coming, and have been attacked by paladins and other heroes.  Such battles have not yet been frequent enough to trigger a state of outright war between the Harmonium and the dragons of Hazhkan, but this may only be a matter of time.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Gods</span></p>

<p>Many of the deities of Ortho have taken an interest in the lands of Hazhkan, and continue to do so.  Their actions as much as any other have shaped the past of this land.  Gods of Law and Chaos alike play their great game, seeking to shape Hazhkan according to their will, and often clash with one another in this ancient land.</p>

<p>On the side of Law, the Lord of Discipline and the Lord of Scribes figure most prominently.  The interest of the former is obvious - bringing order and the Word to the savages of the land, and encouraging them to structure and prosperity.  Be it through the gentle touch, the stalwart example or the thankless scourge, his servants and priests will tame the wilderness and make a great garden of it.  The Lord of Scribes has a similar interest, but a subtler one - to chronicle both what is being built, and what has come before - preserving the history and legends of the native folk, ensuring that they will not be forgotten and keeping the past alive.</p>

<p>Opposing them most of all is the fading belief in the old Lord of Tricksters.  Though the deities of Chaos have fled Ortho with the Harmonium's triumph, still the Trickster is worshipped in secret, under many names and none.  Its followers spread lies and deceit and flame, causing great trouble for the new rulers of Hazhkan and the death of not a few.  What traps and curses have been left by this departing god, waiting to be sprung on those who would call themselves masters of this land, remain yet to be seen.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Writeups on the Lord of Tricks to come shortly in the document - in my mind he's something of a Coyote or Promethues figure... so you're looking at CG. <img src="http://planewalker.com/sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/wink.png" title="Eye-wink" alt="Eye-wink" class="smiley-content"/></p>

<p>You may want to emphasize the relative difficulty in charting each and every bit of the land in this area - Ortho is considered one of the fully conquered worlds - so I'm assuming the "backwards natives" are like some of the lost tribes of Brazil - not recognized as owners of the land like the invading/settling folks are.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

</div>
I'll come back to the food and tech issue when I'm no longer nursing a snifffling cold and headache at 4am.</p>

<p>However - regarding this - you're right. It *should*. That it *isn't* is actually a sticking point - currently NO offworld holding - not even the multiple primes the Harmonium holds, have province status... why? Simple natural reluctance to spread power outside of the world? Pissiness? This is prime material for a plot hook we plan to work into the world - it *is* an injustice of sorts and will come back to bite them on the hand, eventually a colony kicked around enough will rebell. Write their own constitution... toss the Harmonium's tea in the harbor... so to speak. </p>

<p>(Ok - that cold med is really getting to me now isn't it?)</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Thoughts?...Also, I was wonderin' what you folks think alignment and racial percentage make up of all Ortho is?...
</div>
Populations of people are a vast majority TN. The Outlands routinely recieves more petitioners than any other plane the way I understand it. </p>

<p>Now - there's a difference between the alignment of *people* and the alignment of a *society*. Subtle - but think about it for a moment and it's there. Githzerai are a prime example of this. Chaotic - but socially lawful for survival's sake in Limbo.</p>

<p>Population wise? TN wins hands down. Socially? LE through LG, overall LN b/c of the federal nature of the government.</p>

<p>Racial percentages - it's a toss up between humans and orcs on who wins the 'propogate like roaches' award. MY odds are on humans for the moment simply because of lifespan and ability to adapt well. But then theres also half orcs, tieflings, and assimars sort of diluting the blood a bit so the human to orc percentages are probably roughly the same. Dwarves are probably less than either (again, lifespan issues), and beholders even less. Elves and gnomes are 0% or at such a low amount as to be statistically irrelevant.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div> And, as a last question, I noted that the merfolk are mentioned in the creation myth; are they still around and, if so, why not make them a province, perhaps a Province of the Underseas? Well, that seems like enough questions for now, although I'm sure I'll come up with a few more as that's what I'm good at...</div></p>

<p>Which one of the two creation myths? (I'm not quite focused enought o reread at the moment) - I assume you mean something different than what we had worked out with the underwater adapted teiflings in the isles? (A deliberately introduced bloodline to aid in the war against Iathra that the Thaeran Empire was holding the line in for a *long* time before the Harmonium stepped in to help.)</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

It's from Rip's "Who Gets What Territory" Myth...The Aqua-tiefling is very localized whereas the Merfolk would be found throughout the oceans of Ortho, if they weren't wiped out in the past...I was just wonderin' 'cause they're mentioned in the Official Harmonium Creation Myth, which mentions all the races that are part of the Harmonium Movement...If the Merfolk were still around, a province for the Oceans would make more sense than, say, giving Land #10 or Land #17 province status (especially as those two provinces are fairly inhospitable and, in actuality, very, very, very small when one scales the flat map to actual global size...If we could only get a Peters Projection for the Map of Ortho)...

<p>Now - there's a difference between the alignment of *people* and the alignment of a *society*. Subtle - but think about it for a moment and it's there. Githzerai are a prime example of this. Chaotic - but socially lawful for survival's sake in Limbo.</p>

<p>Population wise? TN wins hands down. Socially? LE through LG, overall LN b/c of the federal nature of the government.</div><br />
The reason I brought this up is that the pdf notes that the majority of the population of Ortho are members of the Harmonium and that in some provinces the percentage is near (?) 100%...Now, I'm still stuck in 2nd ed. where one had to be Lawful to be a member of the Harmonium and it was implied that far more than a majority of Ortho were members of the faction...Does one still need to be Lawful to join the Harmonium?...I suppose that TN could be a plurality, but I really envisioned the Lawful alignments making up a very large percentage of the population...<br />

         <p>Hm. A compromise of the two ideas:</p>

<p>I'm inclined to loosen 'membership' a little. Or at least Namer-ship that is. You can't advance in the Harmonium without being lawful. But you can say you believe all you want and be a card carrying member who follows the rules more from convience and reluctance to get in trouble than from true belief. </p>

<p>We have plenty of examples from real life of people who claim to follow a belief, and may even for the most part actually follow it out of no motive not to.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>In all honesty? Not much. <br />
From a biologists standpoint, the change is massive to costal ecoststems. Think about how many birds feed on stranded seelife left by the tide. With out a moon, there is no tide. (And no, not having a tide controlled moon doesnt cause devestation if you start off with no moon. It's only a problem if the tide which already exists is removed.)</p>

<p>So, canged in see life, costal life... probably a lot less of things washing up on shore. From a character standpoint, nothing major. Just make sure you reflect the lack of a moon and the lack of a tide in the culture. Little changes, nothing more.</p>

<p>I think that the lack of the moon itself would be more interesting. For one thing, the field of astronomy would be very backwards. Just think of how much of our early astronomy was determined using ideas and assumption based on what we knew of the moon. No eclipses, no basis for...</p>

<p>Wait. Without a moon, they must have a completly differant calander.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>The Eight Jewels of Harmony are the eight largest and most productive of the Harmonium's colonies.  These triumphs of the Harmonic ideal produce nearly a third of the grain consumed in all Harmonium cities, almost uncountable military and trade resources, convert vast amounts of raw material to finished goods and provide five out of eight of all soldiers in the Harmonium's armies.  </p>

<p>	Intagril the oldest of the eight provides the Harmonium with many formidable spell casters and a great deal of magical equipment.  </p>

<p>	Anoc is the largest of the eight jewels even with only half of its prime sphere actually occupied by the Harmonium.  It is a huge world of plains and sky, with relatively few mountains.  Only Anoc's Northern hemisphere is inhabited as the equator is far too hot for any permanent settlement.  The southern portion of the sphere is largely unexplored due to veins of ore that seem to block divination and travel to the South is exceptionally hazardous.  The colony exports a large portion of the grains consumed throughout the Harmonium.</p>

<p>	Arcadia is the great colony of the outer planes.  It is the great training and staging ground for the armies of the Harmonium.</p>

<p>	Meter is the most politically outspoken of the eight jewels, at the fore for the push to become a province and demanding rights for its citizens.  While this does cause tension the colony spans the entire prime sphere and has provided some of the best generals, officers and elite forces that the Harmonium has ever seen.  It also is rich in both agriculture and mining recourses.</p>

<p>	Lucidia is a small colony built on the moon orbiting a firery volcanic prime sphere.  It is the base for a great many spell-jamming ships and is a large port of call helping to protect four major trade routes.</p>

<p>	Fjorge is a world inhabited by a race of small industrious insectile creatures, called the K'jinte.  The first explorers from the Harmonium where quickly drawn into negotiating between two hives.  Now the Harmonium has brought peace to the world by acting as mediators between the hive-clans.  The K'jinte are a strong industrious race that have taken a natural ease to adapting to the Harmonium way of life individually.  The only problems come from competition between hives as their warriors pheromones will cause them to attack warriors of another hive automatically.  Thus while K'jinte armies are highly efficient the generals of the Harmonium must be careful not to mix warriors from different hives. </p>

<p>	Anara is the great industrial world blessed with great veins of ore and thick forests.  It has only been colonized for a hundred years but has quickly become a vital part of the Harmonium's economy. </p>

<p>	Eallia is a ocean covered water world ruled by two nations, one of aquatic elf serfs ruled by the aboleth and one of sahuagin.  The colony provides a large supply of algae and fish food stocks.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

          Ortho: Nations, Provinces, People, Places        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>In one of my creation myths, there used to be a moon but it got blown up (whether centuries or millennia before the Harmonium I'm not sure). Maybe that's why everyone on Ortho got so extreme, philosophically speaking.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.geocities.com/ripvanwormer/harmonium.html" class="bb-url">My Hardhead page</a> has a number of different colony worlds.</p>

<p>Red Terra: this world is similar to our Earth, except that the Harmonium appeared as technological advisors to Oliver Cromwell's government in England. In the century or so since then Harmonium England has conquered or economically dominated most of Europe, the Americas, Asia and the South Pacific. The Harmonium considers this world to be essentially pacified, and welcomes its citizens as Ortho's "little sister." For simplicity, this version of Earth is polytheistic (and primarily Roman), although some Hardheads from other worlds may be Muslim, Jewish, or Christian. Before the reign of Cromwell, Britain was dominated by the Celtic pantheon and the cults of the personification Brittania and her divine consort the current king, but Cromwell's ascension brought the Roman pantheon-worshipping Puritans into power. For a touch of the exotic, this planet's sun is large and red.</p>

<p>Synthesia: this world's natives are intelligent plants. They look much like humans, except their skin is a rich green and their heads sprout thick leaves instead of hair. They reproduce by cross-pollination and budding, so they always ensure that there are plenty of bees around; some actually have hives within their hollow torsos. The synthesiates, who gain all of their energy from their world's sun and do not have to compete for mates, have little reason to fight and have been pacifists for their entire history. When the Harmonium arrived, they found they had little to do: the Synthesiates agreed with most of the Hardheads' ideas, and although they wouldn't help the faction fight anyone they would open their world to agriculture and mining, and join the faction in non-combatant positions. Today Synthesiates are a rare but growing presence in Harmonium-controlled regions of Arcadia, the Outlands, and Sigil, acting as scholars, healers, and menial servants.</p>

<p>There's another world dominated by unchanging immortal carnivores: not vampires, but a living species which regenerates itself instead of reproducing. Being absolutely still and constant and desiring a multiverse which is much the same, they are parlaying with Harmonium representatives, trying to work out a mutually compatible philosophy. Things are going well, but the natives are so slow in their routines that it may be a century or so before the first preliminary treaty is drafted, and the Harmonium may never convince any of them to accompany the faction off-world.</p>

<p>There's another world where the only intelligent lifeform the Harmonium has discovered is a kind of reddish mold or lichen. It's possible to inject the spores of this organism beneath humanoid flesh where it quickly arranges itself as a rigidly patterned tattoo, living parasitically off of its host's body heat and minor nutrients. As it grows, it eventually extrudes pointed spikelike organs. The reason the Harmonium is interested in this organism is the fact that it shares its mind with its host. The mold is very complacent and suggestible, and its host tends toward the same. The mold also contributes intelligence points, while stripping away wisdom.</p>

<p>Iotia: Basically, every life form on it bases its habits on mimicry. Mammals mimic plants, plants mimic mammals, aquatic birds mimic fish, and the humanoid races mimic one another. In general, a tribe of humanoids will all pattern their behavior off of the member who has proven to be the most clever and resourceful. When different tribes meet once a year, they hold contests where they try to prove their leaders' ingenuity and usefulness; if they're extraordinarily successful, the different tribes may merge and become one.</p>

<p>In this campaign, the Harmonium meets them and proves that their skill and knowledge is far beyond what the natives know. Within a few years, everyone on the planet is trying to make themselves into the ideal Hardhead, even adjusting their facial features in order to look more human. Some of the red-spikey armored humanoids walking the Arcadian-style cities are actually plants and animals innocently imitating the sentients! The Harmonium is ecstatic, but some of the natives brought to Sigil have begun imitating members of other factions, or no factions at all. As a result, natives are strongly discouraged from going anywhere but Iotia, Ortho, Synthesia, Arcadia, Fortitude, or the planet of spiky fungi.</p>

<p>The Harmonium is active on a number of other worlds and planes, and is fighting several simultaneous wars against stubbornly resistant nations.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Actually, we could combine my ideas with Gerzel's if that's okay.</p>

<p>Intagril could be the world of intelligent plants (which could still be called Synthesiates). It might have other races too. </p>

<p>Anoc could be the world of the spiky red lichen, or that could be Lucidia.</p>

<p>Meter could be what I called Red Terra, except I don't know if everyone likes the idea of alternate Earths. If that's too far out there for most of you, feel free to disregard it.</p>

<p>"Iotia" could be Anara. I'd rather use Gerzel's name.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>So, I've been playing around with the map and recentered it on Harmony's Glory (as a prime meridian) to give a different view of the world...I've included longitudinal and latitudinal hash marks on the edges to indicate every 15 degrees; I've been trying to grok where places would be geographically analogous to RW places...I've been playing around with some ideas for the far southern land (#17), possibly named Gelidal, that would be a combination whaling depot, indiginous tribal hunters and severe gulag mining (possibly mining Adamantine or Mithril under the mountains of the far south)...<br />
