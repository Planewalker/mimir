         <p>Update to a previous entry: It appears Equestria possesses a portal to and from Tartarus, in the Third Gloom of the Grey Wastes.  Cerberus got out recently, and disported himself in Equestria briefly before returning to duty.  Apparently, the Guardian of the Gates manifests locally as a much more frolicsome hound than his typical personality.</p>

<p>Of course, it's rather troubling that he would leave his post anyway, even if no prisoner escaped the Underworld during his jaunt.  What happened, and is the Waste portal secure on the Equestrian side?</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><strong>Name:</strong> The Fourth Gloom</p>

<p><strong>Access:</strong> There is a one-way portal in the back room of a tavern in the Clerk's Ward. A lonely deva occupies this room at all times. The portal key is the tooth of a dangerous reptile. At least one portal (allegedly two-way) is hidden somewhere on Oinos.</p>

<p><strong>Prevailing Conditions:</strong> The Gloom is a prehistoric, prime-normal world. Its most notable natural features are wild extremes of weather and all manner of dangerous plant and animal life.</p>

<p><strong>Inhabitants:</strong> The planet's two intelligent races refer to themselves and each other as tanar'ri and baatezu – in reality they are the vile reptilian descendants of long-ago fiendish immigrants.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong></p>

<p><em>Cyric gazed out from his Bone Tower and rolled his divine eyes at the roiling masses of fiends hacking each other to pieces in the day's installment of the Blood War. He had long since grown weary of the scene by the time the devils had pushed their enemies more than close enough to the Tower for his taste; as he turned his attention elsewhere, a gaping rift opened in the blackened soil and thousands of fiends tumbled into the beyond.</p>

<p>Crash landing in a prehistoric bog inflicted barely a dent in the combatants' battle frenzies and the fighting continued for several more moments until, as if the battlefield had been struck with a massive spell of dumbfounding, the fiends simply stopped. Looks of disbelief swept their grotesque faces as they took in their new surroundings. Baatezu commanders frantically ordered their warriors to regroup, and while this troop movement provoked a brief swell of violence, the surviving devils were able to successfully retreat into the jungle, leaving the tanar'ri to their confusion.</p>

<p>The two groups would engage in many brief skirmishes over the next several years. Unable to gate in allies, each side watched its numbers grow more and more dramatically finite; perhaps neither were prepared for the notion of a war of attrition with a conceivable end in sight. Whatever the explanation, both sides devoted the bulk of their time to plotting, claiming territory, and forcing their carnal affections on the planet's plentiful dinosaurs.</em></p>

<p>Today the surviving fiends number in the mere dozens; however, they command legions of fearsome descendents. The baatezu bred systematically over many generations, eventually resulting in several identifiable sub-races of passably intelligent devilsaurs: armored tanks, lightning-fast marauders, and colossal behemoths, to name but a few. True to their nature, the tanar'ri nation is a terrifying jigsaw of scales, fangs, wings, and teeth.</p>

<p>While both sides seem to revel in the orgies of carnage that their new numbers allow, the surviving fiends are quite taken with their de facto promotions. When not marching on one another, both armies stay busy erecting forbidding fortresses and obscene monuments to their progenitor gods.</p>

<p>Millions of fiends had died that day on Oinos, so the disappearance of several thousand at the Bone Tower scarcely warranted attention. But in time, baatezu and tanar'ri elites could not help but take notice of this strange happening on the prime. While its outcome would most likely be of no consequence to the larger Blood War, both sides have taken to scheming ways to intercede seemingly on principle, dispatching non-fiend minions capable of travel to the prime to Sigil and the Wastes to search for the portals. Following years of epic spygames, the forces of good identified the Sigil portal first and, happy to see this smaller Blood War left alone to burn itself out, they are keeping the secret the best that they can.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>This is awesome.</p>

<p>It seems that the forces of Good might even want to send some researchers to this world to learn how it's keeping the fiends from summoning reinforcements or getting word home.  Of course, you wouldn't want them to get caught and reveal the location of the portal...</p>

         <p>Thanks Jem! This made my day.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>It seems that the forces of Good might even want to send some researchers to this world to learn how it's keeping the fiends from summoning reinforcements or getting word home.</div></p>

<p>I actually wrote that under the impression that fiends couldn't properly "summon" other fiends, but could only gate them, which wouldn't work on the prime. Obviously I'm probably mistaken about this. In any case, I suppose I could explain it away by saying that Cyric didn't merely kick them down a hole but actually banished them to the prime with extreme prejudice. Though your research proposal is a great hook. Celestial academics studying "applied fiend theory" as part of the larger war effort is the best.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>And when you say intelligent, you just mean that they're bright animals, is that right?

<p>This I completely did not think about. Originally they were quite intelligent, essentially reptilian tielfing giants, which I quickly realized was the most boring physiological option by many many miles. In the final version I did imagine them as having awareness-level of intelligence, enough to self-identify as tanar'ri and baatezu and to look on the fiends as gods walking among them. That said, knocking them down a few notches to smart animals would probably work just fine, though the soul-saving angle is awfully fantastic. I happily leave that to the discretion of the hypothetical GM...</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><strong>Name:</strong> Ellura</p>

<p><strong>Access:</strong> There is a portal in the back of a candle shop in the Market Ward. The key is a freshly picked flower. The candlemaker has only become aware of the portal recently, when fierce, bearded heroes awkwardly bearing bouquets began demanding access to her storeroom.</p>

<p><strong>Prevailing Conditions:</strong> Ellura is a verdant prime-normal world, though its frozen north pole is slowly creeping southward. It now reaches a third of the way to the equator, with the northern quarter of the planet's main continent now encased in ice.</p>

<p><strong>Inhabitants:</strong> The largest continent, also called Ellura, is populated primarily by humans, alongside smaller communities of elves and dwarves. The unnamed land mass on the other side of the world is the domain of metallic dragons, though tribal humans can be found there as well.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> For centuries Ellura was yet another forgettable prime world, with no knowledge of the multiverse and of little interest to planars. Its atmosphere of uneventful pleasantness was only interrupted by occasional violence between marauding norsemen and their southern neighbors. Several decades ago that changed dramatically. Mainland humans and demihumans had previously been able repel the northerners with relatively minimal losses, but now entire cities and villages were being turned into piles of corpses and ragged bands of refugees. Fighting alongside frost giants and snow leopard lycanthropes, the norsemen thundered southward, seemingly unstoppable. Few survivors stuck around to see what would happen next, and those who did likely wish they had not. Following the wave of pillaging and destruction were the great and horrible frost sphinxes, freezing the world and building massive pyramids and obelisks of ice.</p>

<p>The original frost sphinx was created long ago by Set to act as his proxy in frozen Stygia. It is unclear if the beast's appearance here with more of its kind is at the behest of the lord of evil or part of its own agenda. In any case, the sphinxes appear to desire nothing other than death, destruction, and ice, a perfect confluence of law and evil. Some speculate that they are not so much allied with the highly chaotic norsemen and giants as they are herding them.</p>

<p>Affluent kingdoms to the south of the continent view refugee stories of giants and werecats with skepticism and all but deny the idea that the upper portion of the continent has become a frozen wasteland. But as more and more desperate travelers appear in the south, to say nothing of massive migrations of wildlife, the truth becomes more difficult to ignore. Sadly they remain completely unprepared for the invaders.</p>

<p>The sphinxes have, for now, all but abandoned their designs on the large continent on the other side of the globe; while the first human settlements they encountered were easy pickings, the dragons were far less so. The (mostly good and neutral) dragons bear no strong affection for the humanoids that drove them across the world centuries ago, but those feelings appear blessedly overshadowed by their opposition to evil. The ocean is too vast for even the mightiest fliers to cross, though some have flown north, over the crown of the world, to attack the sphinxes' rear flank. Unfortunately the travel across the tundra left those brave dragons too weakened to prevail. They have also taken the cause to the planes and while the Egyptian pantheon appears unwilling to become involved, the Norse powers are quite troubled by their Elluran worshippers' drift towards overt evil. As such, they have begun quietly dispatching proxies and aasimar to assess the situation and lay plans for opposition.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hilketa (the most common of many whispered names for this world, the existence of which frankly remains an open question – the following is a synthesis of rumor, myth, and the ravings of madmen.)</p>

<p><strong>Access:</strong> The first factor keeping Hilketa shrouded in mystery is the lack of a regular portal from Sigil. Temporary portals allegedly appear in the Hive from time to time, with little rhyme or reason to their location. The key is a precise combination of coins and gems in a small sack, or possibly a severed finger. All stories involving use of a Hive portal agree on one thing: upon arriving on the planet, the first sight to greet travelers is a vast, dusty plain, dotted with hundreds, perhaps thousands, of gnarled  iron spikes. Impaled on each one is an arcane.</p>

<p><strong>Prevailing Conditions:</strong> Hilketa is a small, dusty moon in an uncharted crystal sphere. Terrain is primarily rocky desert, with many dry basins and riverbeds. During the day temperatures can reach the upper limits of humanoid tolerability (though the moon's atmosphere and parent planet keep light levels mercifully modest). Shrubs and rare invertebrates appear to be the only natural things eking out a living here.</p>

<p><strong>Inhabitants:</strong> Reports here vary somewhat widely. Setting aside stories that lean towards the ludicrous, the single intelligent race mentioned consistently are the dizanter, the relentless arcane hunters of the prime material plane.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> Those without a stomach for the macabre will find Hilketa thoroughly unpleasant. Those with such a stomach will most likely share this sentiment. Scattered across the moon are dozens of spike fields identical to the one at the point of arrival from Sigil. Close inspection of the tattered clothing that remains reveals several centuries of arcane fashion – presumably the bodies are magically preserved in some manner. </p>

<p>Some accounts (most involving <em>farseeing</em> magic) describe solitary dizantar dragging arcane corpses across the desert for hours. Finally arriving at a spike field, they will seek out an unoccupied spike and heave the body up into the air and onto it. Occasionally this will take several gruesomely comical tries. Without ceremony, the dizantar will then turn around and march back into the desert.</p>

<p>Nearby each spike field is a fortress made of the same gnarled iron material as the spikes. Making little or no architectural sense and covered in all manner of forbidding ornamentation, it is plausible that these structures may have been grown rather than constructed. (That some reports describe the spike fields as “forests” appears to support this theory.)</p>

<p><em>(Note to editor: The veracity of the following is, to be blunt, beyond the bounds of any responsible reason. I have included it as requested but hope that we will be able to review the source material together prior to publication. I take my position here at the Lonely Prime family of publications very seriously and hope you will consider this frank and unorthodox authorial intrusion as nothing other than respectful evidence of that  seriousness.)</em></p>

<p>The only report detailing the interior of one of these mysterious fortresses comes from the wayang rogue Shawarto. He describes a maze of unlit tunnels and smaller rooms (armories, torture chambers, and holding cells) surrounding three larger stacked chambers. The smallest and uppermost of the three contains dozens of keyless portals to locations across the prime. In the middle chamber are as many as one hundred open sarcophagi, approximately half with chillingly silent dizantar resting inside. The largest and bottommost chamber appears to descend deep into the ground and contains what is presumably the accumulated wealth of thousands of murdered arcane. </p>

<p><em>(In recounting this portion of his story, Shawarto produced a tasteful jeweled locket that he claimed to have pocketed before plane-shifting away; identical items are available from a shop little more than a stone's throw from the Lonely Prime offices.)</em></p>

<p>What we know to be true for certain is that the dizantar, once exclusively a scourge of wildspace, are appearing on the Great Wheel. Sources far more reliable than those in this article even report sightings in Sigil. The arcane are, of course, absolutely silent on the matter, but many in the city have fortified their security details with giff, delNoric plasmoids, and other toughs conspicuously suited to prime material plane affairs.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><strong>Name:</strong> Jhunda</p>

<p><strong>Access:</strong> A two-way portal can be found in a junkyard in the Hive. It is keyless and freely passable in both directions, but hidden under a small mountain of junk. Ironically, the portal only allows passage by living things (and the non-living items on their person).</p>

<p><strong>Prevailing Conditions:</strong> Prior to its environmental collapse, Jhunda was a pleasant prime-normal world with a wide variety of ecosystems. While portions of the world remain essentially habitable, food, clean water, and even clean air are in short supply in many areas.</p>

<p><strong>Inhabitants:</strong> The planet's former nations of humans and demihumans have been reduced in number and strength to isolated nomadic tribes. By far the most visible and numerous inhabitants of Jhunda are iron and stone golems.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> From the beginning of its recorded history Jhunda was an unremarkable prime world, home to modest and largely peaceful kingdoms of humans and demihumans. The Sigil portal has received sporadic waves of use in both directions but has been long-forgotten for several centuries. Among its last users was Adami Nirmata, an earth genasi artificer and proxy to Makir, an obscure god of the forge. Chased from Sigil by relentless dao assassins, Nirmata constructed a fortress in the Jhunda mountains and set about forging a small army of golems with which he would defeat Makir's enemies on the Plane of Earth. </p>

<p>An observer would be hard-pressed to maintain that this has not gotten somewhat out of hand. Nirmata pursued his project with an admirable tirelessness, eventually working himself literally to death. The exertion that likely killed him was enchanting a number of extraordinary metagolems capable of fashioning golems themselves. Presumably fueled by some divine energies, the loyal constructs did not let their maker's passing interrupt their assigned task.</p>

<p>Today the planet is a blasted relic of its former self. Now numbering in the millions, the golems have ruthlessly strip-mined entire mountain ranges for raw materials, choking off rivers and poisoning water supplies with their refuse. Uninterested in timber, the hordes simply level forests while passing through them in search of new sources of stone and ore. Long ago a battalion of constructs marched into the sea; within decades, poisoned sea creatures were washing up on shore in massive numbers and  desperate merfolk were telling tales of stone armies thundering across the ocean floor.</p>

<p>Over the centuries sparks of chaos have snuck into the assembly line. Some golems are actively malicious, breaking from their comrades and committing their existences to proactive rampage. Gargantuan bestial amalgams of stone and dirt lumber across the plains, the mad, uncontrollable projects of deranged metagolems.</p>

<p>Destruction of farmland and poisoning of water supplies has reduced Jhunda's population dramatically. The mountain-dwelling dwarves and gentle halflings are all but extinct; humans and elves have been reduced to small nomadic groups dedicated to the search for rare supplies of food and water. They do not possess the magic to travel off world or beseech the planes, but vague details regarding the disappearance of Adami Nirmata may be known to long-lived creatures on the Plane of Earth, worshippers of Makir, or golem and construct enthusiasts. Adventurers might be recruited to find and follow his trail. Though Jhunda itself is most likely a lost cause, particularly good characters may be compelled to mount a grand rescue mission; alternately, especially clever adventurers might figure out some way to use the golems' single-mindedness against them (or against someone else, for that matter).</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><strong>Name:</strong> Kar-Zela</p>

<p><strong>Access:</strong> There is a one-way portal in a fountain in the Market Ward. It delivers visitors into the main square of a bustling triton city. The key is a fish from the Plane of Water, which travelers should follow through the portal once it appears.</p>

<p><strong>Prevailing Conditions:</strong> Kar-Zela maintains four remarkably different environmental regions, each virtually identical to one of the four elemental planes.</p>

<p><strong>Inhabitants:</strong> Though there are few elementals and no djinn, most other creatures encountered on the elemental planes can be found here.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> While exploration has thoroughly confirmed the existence and strange geography of Kar-Zela, it remains one of the most legend-shrouded worlds on the prime. That it is a highly magical artificial planet is a given – the who and why of its construction are matters of great debate. In light of its unique elemental composition some scholars maintain that it must be the work of the Vaati, though most question the power of even the great Wind Dukes to accomplish a feat such as this one. While many intelligent creatures reside on Kar-Zela, none have recorded history that meaningfully addresses the world's origin. And while it is also overwhelmingly agreed upon that there is <em>something</em> at the planet's core, questions regarding what this might be (or whether Kar-Zela is a vault or a prison, and so on) remain completely open.</p>

<p>Viewed from wildspace, Kar-Zela appears to be nothing more than a small, unassuming water world. In truth, water is simply the first of four elemental shells, each approximately 300 miles thick, surrounding the planet's mysterious core. As on the Plane of Water, a swimmer need have no fear of water pressure and swimming deeply enough will eventually reveal the spherical, world-spanning, and invisible wall of force that separates the shells of water and air. Though lacking gravity, the shell of air does have “ground” - the shell of earth below. The boundary between earth and fire is the least clearly demarcated, with miles of lava and magma separating stone from pure fire. At the planet's center, where the flames burn like a sun, is a perfectly smooth black sphere, approximately 50 miles in diameter. The sphere is highly resistant to all forms of attack or divination attempted thus far.</p>

<p>Kar-Zela may be as richly diverse with life as anywhere on the prime, uniting dozens of intelligent races commonly found on the inner planes. Being the outermost, the water shell is the largest in volume as well as inhabitants. Nations of tritons, mermen, and aquatic elves coexist with a minimum of conflict and the shell is plentiful with aquatic animals. Rare holes in the wall of force allow enormous waterfalls into the next shell. Because the spouts move so lazily in gravity-free air, adventurous water creatures will sometimes ride them into the air shell for several miles before the water disperses into the blue. </p>

<p>Winged elves are the rulers of the air shell in all but name, with smaller groups of aarakocra and airborne fey respectfully bowing to the elves' benevolent authority. While the great expanse of air does contain floating chunks of earth as on the elemental plane, they tend to be far smaller and more scattered. Most elven cities are beautiful and absolutely bewildering, with entire neighborhoods elaborately tethered together but otherwise floating freely in the air.</p>

<p>Surroundings and residents become somewhat more ominous at the air-earth boundary. Gravity eventually takes hold near the earth shell and while travelers can walk on it freely, most find the featureless and deserted stone monotony to be extremely unnerving and do not stay long. Like the elemental plane, the earth shell is completely dark and claustrophobic to an extreme. Malevolent derro rule the tunnels here, though they are far outnumbered by tribes of pech and shad. The lava interstitial region is home to the fire giants, who frequently are at war with some or all of their neighbors. Apart from a nation of salamanders, the fire shell is even less populous than its relatively small size would imply. Descriptions of the inner core have only been obtained through sense linking with the strange, fiery animentals that fly close to it. Intelligent creatures within 100 miles of the core are subjected to increasingly powerful psionic attacks, beginning at fear and eventually resulting in incapacitation. </p>

<p>Explorers will often remark on the conspicuous lack of elementals on Kar-Zela, for which they should be grateful. Though few in number, the elementals here are all extremely powerful and very unfriendly to visitors. They do not gather in communities or groups of their own kind and appear to have little role other than as ultrapowerful bouncers, engaging with outsiders on sight. Mercifully, the elemental guardians often appear as satisfied to chase intruders to an outer shell as to kill them. However, attempting to escape to an inner shell is a sure way to invite the absolute brunt of their wrath. The elementals may be the only intelligent creatures on Kar-Zela with any insight into the world's mysterious purpose, but have been quite tight-lipped on the matter thus far.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><strong>Name:</strong> El Feo (the local name for the desert region where the portal from Sigil appears)</p>

<p><strong>Access:</strong> There is a one-way portal in the cellar of the roughest tavern in the Hive. The key is a handful of prime dirt and whistling the following tune: E-A-E-A-E-C-D-A.</p>

<p><strong>Prevailing Conditions:</strong> El Feo is a medium-sized, prime-normal world. The portal from Sigil deposits travelers in a rocky desert.</p>

<p><strong>Inhabitants:</strong> The planet's namesake region is the only portion explored by planewalkers thus far. It is home to halflings, dwarves, and many fey and sylvan creatures adapted to life in the dusty heat. </p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> Travelers from Sigil will find themselves a half-day's walk from Lodestone, a struggling frontier town inhabited by dwarves who mine for gold in the nearby mountains and the halflings who pour their drinks and tend their wounds. The town's mayor is Tuco Sangre, a classic mustache-twirling villain (and secret vampire, at that). In exchange for the “glorious privilege” of mining the region's sad mountains he taxes and abuses his townspeople mercilessly, his will carried out by a band of minotaur thugs. Vampires and mummies control neighboring frontier towns, all under the fist of a reclusive overlord known only as Mr. Bones. Actually a powerful lich, Mr. Bones perpetually roams the desert in a stagecoach pulled by nightmares, never setting down in a single place for more than a matter of hours. As such, his underlings live <em>(ahem)</em> in continual fear of his imminent arrival. Sangre will shamelessly attempt to charm (literally and figuratively) rare planar explorers in the hopes of gaining some advantage in information or power over his peers.</p>

<p>Corruption in what passes for local government is but one hazard of El Feo. Cave-dwelling cyclopses, driders, and gremlins mercilessly harass and plunder the centaur-driven wagon trains that bring supplies to the  frontier. Wandering fortune-teller hags might as soon rip off a traveler's hand as read their palm and there are even tales of a ravine that has become the home of a stranded planar beholder.</p>

<p>Most first impressions of this place are of utter hopelessness, but this is far from the case. In addition to severals towns free of corruption and oppression, El Feo has its share of heroes, stone-cold fey in wide-brimmed hats who face off against evil in hard-bitten showdowns of gunpowder and magic. Local legends include Artemus Grondon, a chain-smoking satyr gunslinger with a face full of scars and a mysterious past; the Hopper brothers, three gregarious grig who talk like they throw knives – very very fast; and Ocmo Grogstop, a snarling verbeeg brawler with a secret heart of gold.</p>

<p>Scattered across El Feo are many literal ghost towns, seemingly long-abandoned communities that come alive <em>(again, ahem)</em> at night, bustling with spirits both malevolent and merry. Many died with business left unfinished, often at the hands of Mr. Bones and his minions. In exchange for assistance in completing their affairs, they may provide adventurers information or even guidance to exotic treasures hidden away in El Feo's largely unexplored Underdark.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><strong>Name:</strong> Armiamra</p>

<p><strong>Access:</strong> No known portals from Sigil, though Armiamra still receives substantial planar traffic in light of its extensive connection and commerce with the ethereal.</p>

<p><strong>Prevailing Conditions:</strong> Armiamra is not a planet, but an enormous web forming a sphere around a small star. Because the majority of the web is empty space, it does not have the mind-boggling surface area of a world such as Nivil (it is also extremely close to its small, cool sun). Rather, surface area equivalent to a large prime world is formed by hundreds of “islands” where the web is dense enough to permit construction and habitation. Depending upon their point of arrival, visitors will need to be prepared for variations in breathable air and gravity ranging from prime-normal to none.</p>

<p><strong>Inhabitants:</strong> Humans, elves, and thri-kreen account for millions of beings here. There are nation-level populations of many other races as well, some of which are discussed below.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> Approached from wildspace, Armiamra first appears to be a collection of asteroids, then spectacular, sprawling city-states floating in the void. The shimmering gossamer web that binds Armiamra together is the last element to come into focus, and certainly the most breathtaking. Speculation about the nature of this mind-boggling megastructure is in no short supply, but little of it approaches the strangeness of the truth. Warmly glowing in a shifting array of familiar colors, the web has been best described as “a deeply strange superposition of the ethereal plane on an uneventful region of wildspace.” For Armiamra's residents, this headache of a metaphor allows them to access and take advantage of the ethereal plane in ways unknown elsewhere in the multiverse. Individual strands of the web act as (or simply are) blindingly fast tunnels through the deep ethereal, permitting individuals to cross the great distances separating Armiamra islands in instants. Extensive mapping of the web and its reach across the waveless sea provides precious access to resources from the inner planes and many demiplanes.</p>

<p>This manner of ethereal travel is managed by the Mistresses of the Deep (or, when they are out of earshot, the Spider Sisters), oracles who maintain serene temples on most populated islands. The temples contain what appears to be permanent access to the border ethereal, toward which oracles will gently usher travelers while discussing with them their destination. After walking a short distance through the mist, travelers will encounter a doppelganger oracle (or the same one, for all anyone knows) – she will confirm the destination and offer her hand. Following a bewildering rush of color and sound and sensation, travelers will find themselves hand in hand with a different smiling oracle, possibly of an entirely different race, who will direct them through another border, this time back onto the Prime and to their destination. The Mistresses consider shepherding first-time travelers to be a profound sacrament and many a dazed novice has been comforted by a radiant young oracle weeping tears of joy.</p>

<p>While spelljamming vessels are used extensively for food, construction materials, and other freight, Armiamra could not effectively function if not for the web; though the Mistresses are avowedly apolitical, there is likely some truth to the rumors that the peace between the many nations and races of Armiamra is due in no small part to carefully placed pressure from the pacifist oracles.</p>

<p>On very rare occasions travelers will simply never appear at their destinations. Most are simply lost in the deep, though interception by an ether cyclone or very lucky ethereal predator is a real (albeit very small) risk. Any who would call the oracles to task for these mishaps have likely never witnessed the gruesomeness of the Mistresses' self-imposed public penance for these losses.</p>

<p>While the vast majority of the web is effectively barren, there are regions of “ethereal leak” where all manner of unexpected things may appear. A famous wildspace captain once reported coming up from below decks to find his crew puzzling over a thousand teacups captured overnight by their gravity plane. Over time, plant life and other organisms suited to the web have crossed over, forming the foundation for modest ecosystems. Ironically, most residents never step foot on a spelljammer ship and know nothing of the strange, beautiful nature to be found, from glowing, crystalline forests to herds of wild ether horses bounding through the strands.</p>

<p>Because the expenses of settling an unoccupied island are relatively high, most islands are single-use, dedicated to dense urban environments or to farming the odd vegetables and fruits that thrive in Armiamra's perpetual twilight.</p>

<p>Concerning places of interest, to even scratch the surface is beyond the scope of this review. However, the locations that follow do illustrate some of the breadth in culture and conditions that a visitor may encounter.</p>

<p>Ostensibly a human city, Beacon could reasonably be considered the Sigil of Armiamra. Sitting at the intersection of more web strands than any other island, Beacon draws visitors and travelers representing virtually every race on Armiamra. Space above the great city is typically thick with spelljammers from elsewhere in the web as well as other crystal spheres. Virtually any good or service can be obtained here, including many wildly exotic ethereal novelties. Adventurers in need of guides to the ethereal would be well-advised to find a nathri – though the ethereal natives can be hired in virtually any large city, their guild headquarters in Beacon is an unmatched resource for ethereal lore.</p>

<p>When asked why they have made their home on the prime rather than on the demiplane for which their city is named, the residents of New Inphirblau are conspicuously silent. In fact, they are conspicuously silent about everything. Floating inches above the ground at all times and communicating with outsiders in free-floating written script, the phirblas have created a stone metropolis that is an all-but-literal monument to silence. Though good-natured and relatively hospitable to visitors, the phirblas take their peace and quiet seriously, and sound above a whisper will quickly elicit sternly worded text from the authorities.</p>

<p>The thri-kreen primarily occupy regions of the web with relatively negligible gravity and T'kkyl is no exception. Thri-kreen cities are grown from an attractive metallic chitin discovered on an obscure demiplane – the material is conveniently covered with divots and scars that are ideal for the insectoids to grasp on to. As such, the epic hive-city has only a minimal sense of up-down orientation. Many a visitor has been stymied by streets that appear to dead-end when in fact they simply continue up the side of a building, to say nothing of discovering locals going about their business directly above one's head.</p>

<p>Sarcesians raise their young on prime-normal islands, but adults do not require air or atmosphere and appear the happiest soaring through wildspace on their glowing, gossamer wings. Risin is a monastery where sarcesian mystics commune with what they have identified as a sacred spot in the void (this communing appearing to consist largely of amazing displays of high-speed wildspace acrobatics). A modest collection of structures lashed to the web, Risin has neither air nor gravity. Though the mystics are unexpectedly welcoming to well-meaning visitors of similar stellar reverence, they regret they are not equipped to accommodate beings less suited to the environmental conditions than they (which is to say, anyone else).</p>

<p>For all of its interconnectedness, Armiamra's vastness permits it more than its share of secret places. The locations that follow are accessible from wildspace and the ethereal, but are not found on the Mistresses' web network.</p>

<p>Skyfield is part artists' colony, part wildspace industrial park, a hideaway where the reclusive reigar produce large-scale one-of-a-kind commissions, from spelljamming ships to lavish floating palaces destined for the Elemental Plane of Air, taking advantage of choice spots in the ethereal to obtain lavish and novel raw materials. Arcane middlemen are the only outsiders permitted here, and few unwelcome visitors are likely to encounter a reiger anyway, as they are far outnumbered by the xixchil artisans, tinker gnome engineers, and legions of laborers that bring their extravagant designs to life.</p>

<p>Unknown and unnamed, perhaps the most remote habitation on Armiamra is a strange fortress made from a shellacked kindori carcass. This is the home of Globulox the Tumor Angel, a daelkyr noble dedicated to the demented artistic traditions of his kind. Globulox has learned not only how to bring ethereal proto-matter onto the Prime, but also how to coax it towards biology just prior to injecting it into a terrified recipient. While most subjects perish in relatively short order, Globulox maintains a museum showcasing some of his dreadful masterpieces.</p>

<p><em>Sarcesians are asteroid dwellers from Pathfiner's 'Distant Worlds' book and far too cool not to make an appearance here, narrative coherency be damned.</em></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><strong>Name:</strong> Hmyz (popular transliteration)</p>

<p><strong>Access:</strong> There is a one-way portal in an alley in the Market Ward. The portal itself must be traced out by a walking prime-material insect not under magical or psionic control. This is a tricky thing.</p>

<p><strong>Prevailing Conditions:</strong> Once a warm, prime-normal world, Hymx now lives up to its planar nickname, Demogorgon's Garden. Temperatures are sweltering year-round and the planet is overrun with monstrous, carnivorous plant life.</p>

<p><strong>Inhabitants:</strong> Hmyz is located on the edge of a group of crystal spheres known colloquially (and often derisively) as 'The Thorax Cluster'. Near the former seat of the antediluvian thri-kreen empire, virtually  any insectoid race with a presence in wildspace can be found in this region of the prime; many other humanoid races are present, but are a small and novel minority. Hmyz itself was formerly ruled by the haughty k'r'r'r, though they were more than outnumbered by rastipedes, isopterites, and other servant and slave races.</p>

<p>While many insectoids still exist on Hmyz today, most are near-mindless thralls of the plants. Savage and malevolent versions of creatures such as treants, wood woads, vegepygmies, and myconids are plentiful, but most intelligent plant life is of a more stationary and less individualistic variety.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> Theories explaining the infection that ravaged Hymz range from the relatively mundane (the inadvertent introduction of some aggressive plant vermin on a spelljamming ship) to the exotic (an invasion of Abyssal treants). Ironically, the truth begins with forces of good, a quartet of paladins from Sigil intent on bringing the good news of their order to insect space. The four had recently spent time on the prime world <a href="/www.planewalker.com/forum/log-x-the-primes#comment-52239">Scar</a> and while they were unaffected by the positive energy with which they remained suffused, those they encountered on Hymx were not. The most thoroughly infected were a group of young abeil who became quite taken with the holy warriors. Hymx bee-folk were responsible for maintaining much of the world's agriculture and it was not long before the infection had spread back and forth between plants and animals many times over.</p>

<p>While the punishing positive energy was mostly fatal to the insectoids, local plant life reacted far differently. Its rapid development of the capability to aggressively interact with its surroundings was followed by the emergence of strange alien sentience. The insectoids who had avoided and survived the infection found themselves terrorized by their gardens, parks, and forests.</p>

<p>Decades later, the line between plant and animal life has become increasingly murky. The adoption of chitinous exoskeletons has greatly aided the plants' increased ambulatory capabilities. Former insectoids, now mindless drones, are hideous, seemingly crowded out of their own shells by vines and black fungus. An equally muddy confluence of biology and magic defines the arcane biotechnology that preserves what passes for the planet's ecology. The rapid upsurge in plant byproducts has darkened the atmosphere and the plants now gain more energy from protein than from the scant sunlight. Millions of living (and countless dead) insectoids and animals have been deposited into infernal salvage bogs, which preserve chitin and other useful organic materials while breaking down the remainder into food. In a gruesome twist, former abeil now tend fields of bloated, limbless, and mercifully mindless insectoid husks that provide another food source for the planet.</p>

<p>While many presume that the planet operates under the control of a central consciousness of some kind, this is far from the case. Many factions of plant life are constantly battling for territory and resources on the blasted planet. While conflict between the less-ambulatory and more alien-minded groups tends to be of an invisible, ecological variety, other species wage war in a more traditional sense. Vicious myconids will frequently surge to the surface and raze entire swaths of land above their homes in the underdark. When not perpetrating massive campaigns of deforestation, feral vegepygmies and volodni war against each other at the behest of shambling mound and treant warlords (the latter are breaking troubling ground on a school of thaumaturgy bearing uncomfortable resemblance to the defiler magic of Athas).</p>

<p>Hymx's neighbors have placed it under strict quarantine and continually debate solutions ranging from planetary destruction to dramatic pleas for divine intervention. The only known surviving insectoids are a group of formians hiding out in a small region of relatively barren desert. Some of their planar brethren are working to raise awareness of this atrocity on the planes and planar adventurers may find a group of the industrious Arcadians seeking out their aid. Sadly for the formians, the only planars to travel to Hymx in any numbers thus far have been an assortment of clerics and druids intent on spreading the word of their plant-friendly patrons to the new intelligences on Hymx. While the plants have been grateful for these visitors, suffice it to say that their enthusiasm for theology pales in comparison to their enthusiasm for lunch.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>NAME:Obsidis</p>

<p>ACCESS:There is  two way portal in the Marketward of Sigil; A black arc made of obsidian; A not evil undead can open it simplytouching it's runes, Other walkers need topaint the runes with the blood of an evil outsider</p>

<p>PREVAILING CONDITIONS: Obsidis Sun is a Positive Energy Sfere while his Moon Dyakis, is an orrible Demon-Head; Obsidis Sun is fatal for any udead creature, while living creature gain Quick Healing 5; On night, as Dyakis always show it's horrible, full face, every non-outsider living creature exposed to the moon light takes 5 negative level/round while Undead gains Quick Healing 5; Souls, Uncorporeal Undead and Evil Ousiders can't leave or enter the sphere throught regular planewalking. Powers of the sphere reside directly on the prime, in restricted regions they can leave only in avatar form.<br />
Once a normal prime,with a singol large Landmass, called Aerion and a large Ocean, called Tellarys, this prime was, century ago devastated by fiend invasion; Throught powerful magic the Obsidisians were able to stop urther invasions, but, doing that, they sealed the fiends intheyr prime, together with theyr own souls; Theyr gods were luckily able to relocate, in order to not lost the souls of theyyr followers. </p>

<p>INHABITANTS: On The Western Half of the sphere, live the Fiends; C/E <br />
form The Howling Horde, N/E The Dark Coalition, while the L/E are the Hellsteel Legion. The three groups forms the fiendish Empire; They can bred true, now, or the can steal the soul ofthe mortals to create newfiends; Dead fiends are purified by the gods and transformed uin Mortalbeings.<br />
On the astern half cohabit The Livings and the Undeads; The Gods of this Sphere and theyr celestial servants live in this half too. </p>

<p>DESCRIPTION:There are two most important factions on Obsidis: The Empire of the Fiends, governed by the Triumvirate of Terror (An Archdevil, a Demon Prince and an Archdaemon) and the Enduring Alliance, formed by mortal races and undeads; The Empire of the Fiends Control the occidental half of the sphere, while The Enduring Aliance control <br />
The Oriental one; The Fiends forged theUnholy Alliance of the Fiendish Empire after clashing beetwen themselves; The created the demonic Moon in order to gain the upper hand, but the Undeads (Result of so many souls unable to pass beyond) decided, with theblessing ofthe gods to struck a pact with the livings; undeads protect the livings during night and the Livings feed Undeads and protect them, during day. Undeads have to never attack the livings umprovokly, and to feed without to kill, if it's possible. Undeads prefer Underdark.<br />
Every City in the Enduring Alliance have a city of the Livings, and one of the Undead; The two people are firmly allied, even if some extremist still try to spark a fight beetwen the two allied factions. Good undeads are a common occurrence on Obsidis, as are good exemplars of normally evil living races;</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Name:</span> Kereon (outsiders' name: Floodworld)</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Access:</span> A wandering portal that sites itself in public wells and fountains, usually in the Clerk's Ward.  Fortunately, one doesn't get wet: the key is a gangplank laid over the water, which follows one through.  The reverse key is the same, but portal back also wanders through various ships.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Prevailing Conditions:</span> The portal comes out in a fleet of ships on a Prime ocean.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Inhabitants:</span> Standard humanoids, with a relatively small number of dwarves.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Description:</span> Several hundred years ago, Kereon suffered an environmental disaster on which the causes are disputed.  Some say it was a fiendish or Inner-planar incursion, which leads cultures where this belief holds to be distrustful of planars.  Others say it was a local problem caused by a megalomaniac with access to insane magic, or world-shaking battle spells that ran out of control.  Whatever the case, the world was flooded, all but the floating ice caps of the poles and a few high mountain tops.  All the prophecies agreed that it was to last almost precisely a thousand years.  But the flood happened slowly enough -- over the course of a generation -- that the major nations were able to prepare.</p>

<p>With the guidance of the druids and the elves, populations of plants and animals of land, sky and freshwater were tucked away.  Some were turned to stone and marked with metal signs so that they could wait out the ocean and be restored to life after the waters receded.  Others were put into bubbles in the Ethereal.  Many, especially domestic animals, were packed onto the ships.</p>

<p>The ships took forests of ironwood and reams of metal.  They are bigger than the largest battlecruisers on most Prime worlds.  It is almost impossible to power them; it takes regiments to man the oars strongly enough to turn courses a few degrees when two of them approach each other.  Some are anchored with mile-long chains to the bottom, while others drift with the currents of the world-ocean.  A village-ship may be the size of a supertanker, a double-thick barge carrying barracks, barns and rain tanks, as well as one-room operations for a smithy, butcher, tailor, and other professions vital to survival.  Depending on its home culture, it may tow acres of flats on which dirt has been piled, renewed frequently with manure and rotated regularly with crops of beans and other staples, or greenhouses in which drip irrigation feeds vegetable vines on trellis after trellis.  All of the villages have extensive fish trawling operations.</p>

<p>With each passing century, more of the ships are being replaced by iron barges, since even ironwood wears out eventually.  Mining operations staffed by water and earth elementals and constructs bring up ores that are slowly laid out on shipyard ships until a new hull is added to the fleets.</p>

<p>Although millions died as the waters rose, millions more were saved, enough that cultures could be preserved with some hope of seeing the flood through.  Among humans, galleons, triremes and junks can be seen plying the waters between city-ships, and the rare palace-ships still hold echoes of former glories.  The elves and the ents have somehow managed to keep forests alive on floating hills, intensively cultivating wood that sells for ridiculous prices elsewhere.  Their crafts include aspidochelons, miles-wide turtles magically bound not to dive except after careful temporary removal of the towns on their backs.  Halflings and gnomes in smaller vessels tend to stick with more mobile, single-family fishing operations and the occasional salvage-diving outfit, trading for other goods and such luxuries as flour.  White dragons are occasionally seen, apparently having made their homes on the polar ice caps.  Even the orcs and the goblins sail the seas, with the home nation of the orcs being a single, massive floating island surrounded by their black-keeled navy.  It's widely believed that the orcs' island requires regular sacrifices to stay afloat; they certainly raid for meat animals frequently, and captives with equal regularity.  Its approach is always met with fear and the raising of armies.</p>

<p>The dwarves, last to be assailed by the rising floodwaters in their mountain redoubts, elected to seal themselves away, their masonry closing their cavern walls so tightly that not a drop would press through even under the mighty pressures of the world-ocean.  Some chose to sleep, weaving powerful spells over whole dwarven cities under the peaks; others, mostly smaller freeholds, looked deep into the dwarven lore and found sources of chthonic magic that would feed them, warm them, and supply air for generations waiting for the waters to recede.  Even the communities that slept made sure to erect powerful protections to keep their treasures secure.  The mountain fastnesses are the closest of the sunken realms to the surface, and make tempting targets for raiders with magic to dive.  Not all of these raiders are thieves, either, since fairly reliable witness has it that in the years after the surface people had floated off on their ships, the dwarves of the mountains with access to diving abilities were not terribly strict with the salvage laws in taking certain choice treasures from among what had been left behind.</p>

<p>Kereon makes an interesting choice of background for a Prime who has moved to the Planes.  Solid ground under one's feet might take some getting used to, but kids on Kereon grow up knowing the sea like the backs of their hands, and the place produces a large number of elementalist mages.  While it would be tempting for Sigil merchants to try to cash in by selling wood or foodstuffs to the floating vessels on the other side, making that business profitable enough for a settled merchant to get into it requires volume, and unfortunately the nature of the Kereon portal militates against this.  Not only does its shifting nature make settled trade routes impossible (and the risk of coming out on the orc island is not inconsiderable), it's not terribly big to bring a load through, and one might end up on a personal vessel that can't take the weight of a load of goods.</p>

<p>Planar scholars might be interested in solving the mystery of what caused the worldwide flood on Kereon, and of course some who hear of the place consider plundering abandoned sites deep in the ocean.  They might bear in mind that aquatic races such as the sahuagin and sea hags are quite happy with the current state of affairs -- so much so that persistent stories run through conversation among ship-dwellers that these races are cooking up some evil magic in the depths to cause the Flood to last beyond its appointed time.  Worse: a new strain of thought on this matter is that life on Kereon isn't so bad right now, and if it's a huge sacrifice the hags need to keep it this way forever, well, there's a certain island we could all do without.  Tracking down the source of this thought is probably impossible, but if it has lodged in any of the ruling heads of the races above, dark times may be confronting the oceans.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Excellent. Lots of fantastic touches here, especially the airtight dwarven hideaways. That's a thousand claustrophobic submarine nightmares right there. Log X worlds as a place to be from (as opposed to a place to go to) isn't something I've really thought about.</p>

<p>As much as brainstorming around this thread takes me back to the despotic joy of the SimCity <strong>Disaster</strong> button, I may just have a happy one in the pipeline. (The theme is "modrons" if anyone would care to offer another planetary perspective.)</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Name:</span> Balgo</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Access:</span> Wandering.  One must exit a window (which may be open) at least three stories up from a building in the Lower Ward, bearing a torch or other fire.  That this was a single wandering portal was only discovered recently by the Guvners, who have successfully calculated its path in their Portal Log, and now know which buildings to use.  They are keeping it mostly secret, although the building owners know their building is occasionally a portal site and enterprising touts of the Ward are known to be sharing observations on the matter.  The other end wanders through a series of wind-sculpted arches in dry gullies on Balgo.  Arrival in Sigil is to the outside of the building; travelers should be light-footed.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Prevailing Conditions:</span> Human-normal.  Extremely human-normal.  The portal lets out in an arid but livable region near a harsher desert.  Nonhuman travellers on Balgo suffer -2 to Con until they make a DC 25 Fort save on a 24 hour cycle, at which point the penalty reduces to -1 for the duration of their stay.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Inhabitants:</span> Humans.  Only humans.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Description:</span> Although unusual species are a norm of which Sigil is proud, and Primes are well known for being shocked by the variety of beings that populate the city, Balgo really stands out in this respect.  For a long time, it was mainly known as a source of Keyless; torch-bearing adventurers would head through the wrong path in the gullies -- often seeking someone else who had just come through, since the dried-up delta had a reputation as a place where people disappeared -- and would promptly find themselves sprawled on the streets of Sigil, usually badly injured and quickly robbed.  The portal would have moved on, so no one knew how to get them back, and here they were.</p>

<p>Thing is, the only major intelligent species on Balgo is humans.  The only dwarves are pygmies, and there are no elves, halflings, or gnomes, and certainly no orcs, bariaurs, or modrons.  There aren't even any angels or demons -- the nation near the portal venerates ancestors and a multitude of local spirits, with an underworld afterlife run by the Father of their People, so their best concept of angels is as particularly <span style="font-style:italic">helpful</span> spirits.  Which is close enough, but they take a while to realize that treants aren't the same thing.</p>

<p>This would mostly make Balgonians a target for mockery, except that there appears to be a good reason there are no other intelligent species there: the planet appears to be allergenic to nonhumans, particularly its extremely rare deposits of mithril.  Their mithril weapons strike deep and draw much blood, armor of it gives other species the creeps to touch it, and one known Balgonian shaman's mithril holy symbol is an object of legend in the fiendish community.  Balgonian mithril equipment can fetch high prices when the target is right, especially from human chauvinists, although to date this is partially because sources have been extremely rare.</p>

<p>Now that the portal has been codified, more Balgonian mithril equipment has been showing up through Fraternity outlets.  The faction stands to make a tidy penny off of it, before other interested groups work out the route and the price drops to the typical market rate for similar magical features.  However, mithril is rare on Balgo, and merchants seeking the native stuff are already having difficulty finding it in the nearby tribes, requiring trips to more distant markets.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Name:</span> Tout's Cut</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Access:</span> The whole point of Tout's Cut is that it has <span style="font-style:italic">two</span> stable, easily-accessible portals from Sigil: one a floral trellis in a public pocket park in the Lady's Ward maintained by the wealthy neighbors, and one an arch of brick that used to house a door to an abandoned building in the Lower Ward.  There is no key to either, but they are only open for a few minutes an hour, during which Harmonium officers on each side play traffic cop as crowds rush through toward Sigil in early mornings, and back at night; two-way travel is permitted at other times and cargo tends to travel at peak and nighttime.  The two portals are a mere hundred yards apart on the Prime side, making for a swift shortcut across several miles of Sigil, some rather unpleasant.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Prevailing Conditions:</span> Hot and humid with frequent light rains, naturally a tropical rainforest area, though the immediate area of the portals is now cleared and settled.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Inhabitants:</span> All the variety of Sigilians can be found in Tout's Cut.  Beyond the settled area are Stone Age human tribes and a natural population of dryads.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Description:</span> A city sitting inside a torus atop an infinitely tall Spire doesn't have much room for suburbs.  Tout's Cut was built around one of the only Primes where two such stable, safe portals are so close to each other.  They can be used, at the right time of day, to get across the city lickety-split, and like the rare intra-Sigil portals were a trade secret of the touts for while, until word got around.  The stability of the portals and the fact that the land nearby was arable and unclaimed made it an attractive option to settle for cutters who wanted the elbow room.  The immediate vicinity of the portals is thickly settled and densely built up, if not very well paved -- stone is rare in the area, and not easy to get in Sigil, so the main street is split logs, the houses are wood and palm thatch, and the outer streets are dirt.</p>

<p>Both the arability and the unclaimedness should be clarified: the land is <span style="font-style:italic">quite</span> fertile, but is in its natural state a tropical rainforest.  The region possesses a number of savage dryads who are more than willing to organize attacks of jaguar, anaconda and occasionally a troop of girallons against slash-and-burn would-be farmers.  They aren't too proud to ask the help of the tribesmen beyond, either, and it's now certain that anyone who ventures too far beyond the town boundaries without strong defenses will find himself under assault -- barbarian and light magical assault, perhaps, but anyone who's been on the sharp side of a barbarian's axe knows that can be plenty of problem.  To date they and the poisonous snares they are skilled at laying have been sufficient to the task of defending the region from too-eager expansion.  If someone wants land, they had best make good friends with the natives first.  (Valuable cropland or no, high-level bashers who are a little <span style="font-style:italic">too</span> good at massacring the natives also often draw a response from Sigil's heroes!)</p>

<p>Historically, the nearby dryads finally bowed to reality as their animal armies were driven away from increasing settlement, and their trees now stand inside the town, surrounded by mossy hills.  Although they were once enemies, the younger generation of townsfolk have taken to leaving them small offerings of rich mulches or holy waters, hoping to be friends.  Some even ask the tree-spirits for luck.</p>

<p>The largest is an old kapok tree smack halfway between the two portals, who has gotten sufficiently used to human presence that a polite supplicant who keeps their voice down (especially a handsome male) can talk with her about local doings.  The banana tree just north of town in some of the farmland misses her animal friends, and is willing to share a knowledge of local magically potent herbs and fruits with someone who brings a friendly familiar or animal companion.  There are quite a number of these, including some singularly powerful flora which questers are sometimes here to seek.  (Avoiding the natives is the seeker's problem.)  The dryad of the old strangler fig near the Lower Ward portal has cleric levels and has been known to offer healing to some of the commuting crowds, but no one knows which deity has turned her head; it's apparently some god willing to keep their priests secret rather than proselytize.  Rumor has it that invisible supplicants have come to her roots bearing sacrifices with a bit more... protein... than a nice layer of sod.</p>

<p>There are a couple of reasons the population of Tout's Cut isn't higher.  First, they consider themselves Sigilians, but they're dependent on the Lady's will to keep open both of the portals that link their world to Sigil.  Should either fail -- whether by destruction or the Lady's whim -- they are merely another unremarkable Prime, and should both fail, they are cut off from the village they call home.  Second is that the day of Tout's Cut is not quite the same as the peak/anti-peak schedule of Sigil; it very slowly rotates out of phase, so that for swathes of the year noon is peak, then mid-afterpeak, then afterpeak, etc., until honest Toutscutters are going to work at the crack of midnight.  They call it "the swing shift," and just live with it as the price of fresh air and sunlight.  Third, Toutscutters may think they're Sigilians but the laws of physics disagree with them: children born (or maybe conceived, however the planes decide these things) in Tout's Cut are not planars, but primes.  Furthermore, many Sigilians who live in the city tend to think that Toutscutters are wannabes who can't hack Sigil, an impression which is never fun to have to deal with.</p>

<p>Still, for the chance to live in a place where you can feel real sun and rain, and look out on miles of greenery, and then walk into town and take advantage of the center of the multiverse, Toutscutters are willing to put up with a lot.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Name:</span> Zath (local); The Twilight Caverns (Sigilian casual)</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Access:</span> The pilings beneath a stone dock in the Ditch lead to a cave in one of the monolithic columns that hold up Zath's land plates, about halfway out on the radius of the warm middle plate.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Prevailing Conditions:</span> Frequently dark or dimly lit, but with occasional sun; most parts have a disk of land several miles above.  Otherwise human-normal in most parts, except for two small divine and infernal realms, detailed below.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Inhabitants:</span> In addition to the usual humanoids and Prime animals, there is a substantial population of avariels and bat-people here.  Dire bats are also a more common presence.  Creatures of dawn, dusk and twilight are more easily found here than elsewhere.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Description:</span> Zath consists of multiple plates of stone 1-3 miles thick, held apart by fat pillars about 10 miles wide and 100 miles tall.  The middle plate is the widest, at about 700 miles in radius and with the most pillars (a middle ring of 6 and an outer ring of 12), plus the enormous Spindle that winds its way through the middle of the world.  Higher and lower plates decrease in size, so they have radii that give the whole collection the outer profile of a sphere.  Gravity is pointed downward on all plates.  The total land area would be similar to that of a normal Prime, though oceans, rivers and other water features take up about half.  Whatever creator deity made the place was wise enough that while waterfalls occur from upper levels (mist and cloud by the time the affect the weather below), the middle and lower levels are bounded by mountain ranges and do not usually lose moisture this way, but only through evaporation.  The entire crystal sphere is air-filled, and is not large.</p>

<p>The sun travels on a tilted elliptic orbit around Zath, shining between the plates.  The zenith of the tilt rotates around the plates once a year, giving seasons.  When it is visible between two plates, the light ranges from dawn to mid-afternoon.  Areas very near the edge of a plate get more light, with light more frequently day strength; on the upper plates, a ring around the outer edge has no level above it and gets many hours of direct sunlight compared to the rest of the plate.  However, plates farther above and below get fewer hours exposed to the sun at all.  The net result is that the centers of plates are cool and often dim, outer edges are warmer and drier, and upper and lower plates are colder in general, with the highest and lowest two or three plates ice-bound due to being in darkness for most of the day.  Plates below the middle are colder than those above, and can sometimes be completely shaded, whereas the middle and higher plates get at most a deep dusk, deepest when the sun peaks on the other side of the world (the local winter).</p>

<p>There are four wandering stars near the crystal sphere, which the inhabitants have associated with various gods according to their cultures; the usual pantheons are known on the Prime.  The planets possess large elemental vortices which occasionally open to refresh the elemental composition of the ecology inside the sphere (mostly air and water); there is a portal to Vacuum at the bottom of the sphere which collects anything that falls off of Zath.  There is also a silvery moon, which travels on a circumpolar orbit that rotates once per month.</p>

<p>The pillars are rugged enough to be climbed, although the trip is long.  By dint of many years of labor and spells, each neighboring pair of disks has at least one pillar between them with a Long Stair cut into them.  These are populated with occasional inns with high prices (priests or magic items to create food and water are expensive) where travelers' truces are strictly respected, and those who make trouble find a swift trip out an airhole back to the ground.  There is little room for shipping of any but small items, and teleportation between disks is welcomed by the wealthy of the various nations.  Tireless genie ferries and magic carpet services are available near the edges, and some of the gnome nations have started to work out the kinks of balloon travel.</p>

<p>The frequent twilight and shade make Zath hospitable to crepuscular creatures.  In particular, the undersides of the disks are home to tangles of all sorts of vine and bush, with perches for bird and beast, but especially for a race of bat-people.  Little known elsewhere on the planes (and often taken for tieflings when they do show up in Sigil), bat-folk are actually a quite nice bunch, if you're not a vegetarian.  They are obligate carnivores, and usually hunt birds, although other creatures will do.  These days they mostly practice the keeping of various poultry (who are light, and can, after all, avoid dying in case they fall).  Their settlements, with houses made of woven vine and thatch, hang among the jungle clinging to the undersides of the disks.  (They themselves do, indeed, sleep hanging upside down.)</p>

<p>As nations go, the largest and most prosperous are on the middle disk, which has the most room and the best growing climate.  Humans have taken over most of the open spaces and founded the current major nations there, of which there are three, with smaller kingdoms and island nations scattered about.  Halfling and gnome nomads and settlements are common.  The disk immediately below the middle is mostly populated by dwarves and gnomes, the disk immediately above mostly by elves and treants.  There are some substantial human presences on both.</p>

<p>Further up the land is getting colder, and the next two disks are rugged, wild places not strongly held by any nation.  Scattered settlements dominated by any race tend to cluster around resources like mines of gold or mithril. Even further up the land is so cold as to be almost useless for standard mortal settlement.  These disks are completely controlled by frost giants, who resent that the little folk below them have taken the largest disks -- shouldn't it be the other way around? -- and so they make frequent war excursions down the Spindle, where their disks' road is.  Fortunately, such a chokepoint tends to make those invasions ineffective, although the independent-minded scrabblers who make their living on the frosty Middle Upper tend to suffer a bit too long before calling in help from the folk below.  Below the dwarves' disk is the home of the frostland orcs, who are also happy to stage raids on the warmer lands above.  Unlike other worlds, the orcs also claim to be protecting the other realms from even more terrible lands below, and it's true that human and dwarven historians have records of the orcs fighting battles against terrible hordes of shadowy invaders from the smaller, coldest disks farther down.</p>

<p>The polar disks, just a few dozen miles across, are the home of two groups of ascended mortals: heroes, villains and adventurers who have shaped Zath's history.  Although the sun rarely shines on either, the ends of the Spindle shine with their own light -- bright above, and sullen red on the bottom -- and the divine powers of the inhabitants keep the realm as warm as they please.  The immortals are fairly interventionist, and they are happy to take devoted, worthy souls that are willing to make an afterlife questing on the Prime Material, for good or evil.  Each hero or villain has a method of reviving petitioners that fall in battle on Zath -- the Diabolich ties his former clients' souls to his Immaterial Phylactery, while the Archer That Hunted Death has the lightning reflexes to summon his servants back home an instant before the fatal stroke falls.</p>

<p>-----</p>

<p>About 1 in 6 frostland orcs has the cold subtype, and these tend to be the leaders and warriors of their people.</p>

<p>Zathan Bat-People: thin-boned, light creatures, these monstrous humanoids can fly on their wings, but their hands are part of their wings, so they must typically come to rest in order to use their thumbs.  However, when doing so, they are as dextrous as normal human hands.  Arcane bat-person casters study how to modify the normal gestures for use on the wing, and only a spell new to the campaign might call for a Spellcraft roll to see if they can adapt it properly.</p>

<p>HD: 1d8.  A Zathan bat-person who takes PC classes replaces his racial 1d8 with the normal hit die for his class.</p>

<p>Attributes: Str -2, Dex +6, Con -2, Int +0, Wis +0, Cha +0<br />
Favored class: Rogue</p>

<p>Special Qualities: +6 racial bonus on Listen checks; Blindsight (Ex) (lost if bat-person is deafened, only operates in air, must be triggered to be used); low-light vision; ultrasonic hearing (bat-people may use this frequency range to communicate); fly 30 feet (Average maneuverability; may not operate equipment with hands while flying); bite attack 1d4; if unshod, bat-people possess claws that can attack for 1d4 lethal piercing damage and can grip well enough to give a +2 racial Climb bonus.</p>

<p>Weapon Proficiency: Zathan bat-people have a number of claw-augmenting weapons which their fighters, monks and rangers are proficient with, and which other races would treat as exotic (and probably impossible to use, unless one has claws).</p>

<p>LA: +2</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I'm rereading some of these threads. This one in particular is great, because it's true that Planescape could always use more diverse primes to go through. The idea of the portal in the merchant's house in Tes Yhat, and the commuter route through Tout's Cut strike me as particularly Sigilian.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><strong>Name:</strong> Ledus</p>

<p><strong>Access:</strong> The long-unused one-way gate from Sigil is deep in the catacombs of the Mortuary. Travelers should heave a bucket of water on a particular section of wall and the water will unexpectedly freeze in a perfect circle. Shattering the ice will reveal Ledus on the other side. The portal deposits travelers onto a featureless plain of perfectly smooth ice. Ledus has no return gate to Sigil, but many connections with the planes of ice, air, and water.</p>

<p><strong>Prevailing Conditions:</strong> It is cold. It is very very cold. The lack of wind or precipitation only throws the dry, punishing cold into stark relief. Those without magical protection will not survive for long here.</p>

<p><strong>Inhabitants:</strong> Ledus has no native inhabitants, though the interior of the small world is home to a diversity of exiles from the Paraelemental Plane of Ice.</p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> Barely large enough to even be considered a moon, Ledus orbits an unremarkable prehistoric world in a backwater crystal sphere. Long-frozen and remarkably well-preserved corpses are the only visible features on its otherwise perfectly smooth surface. Tunnels leading into the interior of the world are not uncommon, but the endless expanse of white makes them incredibly difficult to detect with the naked eye. Wanderers that survive for any period of time are more likely to encounter a gang of mephits engaged in one of their myriad hyper-violent and byzantine speed-skating sports.</p>

<p>The surface of the planet is only several hundred feet thick (how gravity works properly here is a mystery, as is how the world remains intact for that matter). The interior is a gigantic chamber several miles in diameter, gently lit by a cool blue, shimmering “sun” in its center. The “sun” is actually a  portal to the Plane of Ice.  </p>

<p>Ledus is something of a perpetual staging ground for the armies of Sigurn Chillbore, a powerful frost giant shaman driven from the Plane of Ice by Cryonax long ago. While Chillbore regularly whips his motley horde of giants, mephits, and immoths into a frenzy over the impending fall of the Cryonax regime, he privately fears (correctly) that this would be a ludicrous and suicidal undertaking; hence his strategizing stretching into the decades at this point. Chillbore and his advisors etch maps and battle plans directly into the ice – enormous swaths of the world's interior are decorated with their work, as they continually reformulate their plans in increasingly complicated fashion.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Name:</span> No common name; the few in Sigil who have heard of it often refer to it simply as "the bush"</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Access:</span> A one-way portal in a clogged and disused drainage pipe on the Lower Ward side of the Ditch, not far from the Shattered Temple. The key is a piece of worked red obsidian; the size of the piece and the degree of craftsmanship don't seem to make a difference, but the material must have been deliberately modified to form a useable cutting edge. Leaving the bush has proven significantly more difficult than entering it, however; see "Prevailing Conditions" below.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Prevailing Conditions:</span> The physical environment is typical of habitable Prime worlds, and the portal from Sigil opens into a fairly pleasant temprate region. Much to the dismay of planar travelers, however, conventional spellcasting, both arcane and divine, uniformly fails to produce any results in the bush. Indeed, all magic on the world seems to be somehow controlled or "owned" by incorporeal spirits inhabiting the local Border Ethereal. These spirits may choose to allow a particular spellcaster to cast one or more of their spells normally, but generally only do so in exchange for a favor or sacrifice, and only after a period of ritualized negotiation. The spirits of the bush seem to be both capricious and easily offended, and it was only relatively recently that a particularly canny planewalker managed to secure their assistance in leaving the plane through the Deep Ethereal.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Inhabitants:</span> Not much is known about the inhabitants of the bush, since only one traveler in recent memory has passed through the portal and returned to tell the tale. In addition to the mysterious and powerful spirits that watch over it from the ethereal, the world is inhabited by the usual varieties of Prime flora and fauna, including scattered bands of humans living a stone-age, pre-agricultural lifestyle. These local people are well-accustomed to working with the local spirits, and have proven to be friendly, if wary, toward strangers. The wilds of the bush do have their dangers, however, and local lore abounds with tales of man-eating giants, capricious fey, and the restless dead.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Description:</span> Travelers from Sigil emerge from a burnt-out hollow in an ancient tree, and the surrounding region is a largely unremarkable oak woodland. Monsters aren't unusually common, but human villages are few and far between, and the locals migrate on a seasonal basis. An unlucky traveler could easily become some ogre's lunch before they ever stumbled across any trace of civilization.</p>

<p>Of course, even if a traveler does have the good fortune to meet up with the locals, establishing any kind of communication with them can prove difficult without the aid of spells like <span style="font-style:italic">Comprehend Languages</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Tongues</span>. The one-way portal has been more-or-less stable for generations, however, and the natives aren't entirely unprepared for the possibility of running into bizzare strangers in the woods. As long as a traveler is willing to play nice, and isn't obviously inhuman, they have a good chance of being taken to the band's Spirit Talker.</p>

<p>Spirit Talkers are specialists in dealing with spirits, of course, and most are minor spellcasters as well. They tend to be intelligent and open-minded sorts, and may be familiar with stories of travelers from other worlds, so making nice with them is the surest way for a planewalker stranded in the bush to survive, and possibly even escape. The proper rituals and etiquette for dealing with spirits are closely-guarded secrets, however, so frustrated wizards and priests may be forced to prove themselves, likely over an extended period of time, before they can open negotiations to get their spells working again.</p>

<p>Of course, other sorts of adventurers can find themselves quickly winning fame and friends, since even a cheap metal knife is the kind of treasure that most of the locals have only heard of in half-remembered legends. A skillful warrior armed and armored in steel is likely to be found far more impressive than a magic-user struggling to reclaim their basic spells, especially if they use their talents to help defend the local village from the beasts of the wild. One would be wise not to underestimate the locals, however; what they lack in technology they make up for in courage and skill, and any fool with a notion to conquer the "primitive natives" is in for a rude awakening.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Galaia is the world of origin of Abaris, the starring character in my <a href="forum/planestuck_.html" class="bb-url">Planestuck</a> game here on the forums.  Readers are welcome to join in at the <a href="forum/planestuck-ooc-thread-and-peanut-gallery_.html" class="bb-url">OOC thread</a>, where I take suggestions for challenges and obstacles for our unfortunate druid to face.</p>

<p>-----</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Name:</span> Galaia</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Access:</span> A portal to Galaia exists in Gurincraag, appearing to be a single large boulder sitting outside a workshop.  The portal key is a casting of <span style="font-style:italic">meld into stone</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">passwall</span> or other spell that allows transit through stone; a basher who can earth glide can also use it.    Once inside the boulder, the user may exit to either Galaia or Sigil.  The portal lets out about halfway down a deep catacomb complex which has recently been overrun by an army employing powerful undead; somewhat fortunately for the intrepid traveler, it wanders through several points in the complex, not all of which appear to be known to the guards, and there are numerous exits.  The complex itself appears to be a relic of a prior planar (or possibly spelljammer) incursion, and if it has been fully explored, the explorers chose not to make their report widely known.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Prevailing Conditions:</span> The catacomb complex is dangerous due to enemies but the environment is livable.  The material world is humanoid-normal on the surface.  Galaia possesses an unusually close connection to the Ethereal and the Elemental Planes, detailed below.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Inhabitants:</span> Galaia features the usual array of humanoid (and other) races.  A recent development (over the past twenty or so years) is the rise of a new and powerful form of undead, first created in a small kingdom called Longmont and now being used by that kingdom to expand and hold an empire.  Their energy-draining undead possess a more powerful form of energy drain, for example, stealing memories and scrambling powers.  Similarly, spawned undead in some cases recall skills from their lives.  Longmont currently holds a fairly substantial chunk of the continent; the war on their borders is in full swing.</p>

<p>The primary faction with a current interest in the world is the Dustmen, who can travel more freely to the catacombs since they are protected from the undead guards by the Dead Truce.  They have been investigating the nature of these improved undead, and are attempting to ingratiate themselves with Longmont in order to learn more about the process.  Naturally, Longmont is protecting its secrets, but it is widely expected that more forceful examinations are also being surreptitiously undertaken.</p>

<p>Prior to the current war, the Believers of the Source trafficked with Longmont to some extent, valuing its easy access to the Ethereal.  The Athar were also known there, and had some influence in support of non-deific belief systems.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Description:</span> Galaia was apparently made by a creator deity with a love of sculpture, for its geology includes water-carved karst caverns, valleys full of wind-carved arches, numerous lava-honeycombed volcanoes, and continental shapes that guide currents into vast whirlpools and winds into hurricanes.  Life can be short under the energetic weather, but it is lived with zest and verve.  The stormy plains and rolling hills that make up most of the major continents are populated with humanoids of all the usual types, and with the typical varieties of culture in regions of plains and forests, desert, tundra, jungle, and so on.</p>

<p>The main variation culturally might be that while most of planes' major pantheons are known, their worship competes for belief with philosophies based around ideas such as druidry (worship of Creation), elementalism (a popular materialist philosophy), and dharma (a belief in cosmic law).  Further underground are a proliferation of hag cults, diabolism, demonolatry and alienists.  Well-informed politicians were known to blame the vocal Athar missionaries for making space for these latter by reducing adherence to the deities, leading to Sigil-sponsored Athar expeditions to wipe them out -- after all, Athar have no more respect for worshipers of devils than they do for worshipers of gods.</p>

<p>Galaia's vibrant topography may be caused by a close connection to the Inner Planes.  The spells <span style="font-style:italic">meld into stone</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">gaseous form</span> have water and fire counterparts here, all of which have similar effects (the user takes on an elemental form and must remain near a boundary surface of the element in question).  Similar spells at the 5th level permit traveling deep within bodies of such elements.  In these forms (or wildshaped into an elemental) a user becomes aware of a whole parallel world of elemental creatures, architecture and events which exist side by side with Galaia and even shape its ecology.  (The fire elemental coexistent plane includes all related forms of energy, such as light, heat, and even sound, although sound is not a hospitable environment for most of the native elementals.)  Locals call these worlds the Elemental Indwelling, or the Border Elemental.</p>

<p>Once within these worlds, a native guide can take a traveller to the Border Ethereal or directly to the relevant Inner Plane, including Para- and Quasielemental Planes if starting near a sufficiently large body of the necessary material.  Elemental vortices are also more numerous on Galaia, and easy to find with relatively well-known divinations.  With the right survival spells or equipment, this allows lower-level spellcasters easier access to the Inner Planes from Galaia.  There is a local druidic prestige class which has the slightly expanded spell list necessary to undertake such travel, and allows earlier elemental wildshape at the cost of fewer total uses.  Several other classes (such as those with access to <span style="font-style:italic">polymorph</span>) also have related variants.</p>

<p>The immediate region of the Sigil portal is a settled warm, wet area of green hills in the nation of Eyre, where the local culture has a Celtic flavor.  Until recently the official pantheon was Celtic, there was a strong druid tradition and the main nuisance was persistent rural hag covens.  Over the last decade or so, the nation has suffered a takeover by the undead army of Longmont, a kingdom that discovered a technical advantage -- an improved form of spawning undead -- and parlayed it into a numerical advantage, successfully sweeping out of its small mountainous territory to take over, assimilate and expand from surrounding nations.  The populace is currently under the watchful eye of a few transplanted Longmont nobles and jumped-up bootlickers, plus a number of turncoat local nobles that pledged fealty (the prior king and his heir died in the same battle), overseeing an army of unsleeping, ghastly cloaked figures that haunt the street corners, fields and forests by day and night.</p>

<p>The local heroes who refused to surrender have mostly gone off to join larger armies further west and south.  An ongoing campaign of harassment and assassination against the turncoats is being waged by a desperate resistance movement.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">
