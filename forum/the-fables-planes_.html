</div> <p>This is thread for some of my short stories. No idea if I should create a seperate thread for responses or anything... So I won't. <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/lol.png" title="Laughing out loud" alt="Laughing out loud" class="smiley-content"/></p>

<p>These short stories are supposed to be the Planar equivalent of some fables told by a canny Prime called Aesop. As such, they have a moral which would be best learned by those who wish to wander the Planes, as a sort of "what to do/not do".</p>

<p>I was convinced to put them here by Arytiss, in case you were wondering why I'm just joining now.</p>

<p>I'm still hard at work on the fourth (read: not overloaded with so much coursework that I need a distraction), which has some... interesting plot points.</p>

<p>Just in case, I'll link to a (pre-Faction-War) Cant Dictionary, from <a href="http://www.mimir.net/cant/cant2.html" class="bb-url">Mimir.net</a>.</p>

<p>And in the third one, I misplaced some buildings. I'd appreciate any feedback on what I should/could have instead. Thanks.</p>       </div>

          FotP 1: Jink-Struck        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><span style="font-style:italic">The first impression Primes and Clueless (especially when the Prime IS a Clueless, or vice-versa) or Sigil hits them hard. It's called being Sigil-struck. Well, think of that, then look at the title.</span></p>

<p>One day, half a turn ago, before the Faction Wars raged and the Lady's Edict was issued, a clueless Prime entered Sigil for the first time.</p>

<p>This man was called Elas Blakeley. He was a miserly, greedy, cantankerous berk, who loved jink and hated people. In his home, he had ammassed an enormous amount of jink by shrewd business practises, clever stock buying and, when no other possibility presented itself, out-and-out banditry and thievery.</p>

<p>Entering Sigil, he was Sigil-struck, as most Primes are. However, when he'd recovered a few minutes later, he was awed by the grandeur of The Lady's Ward and other parts of the Cage. He became, in many ways, jink-struck.</p>

<p>He had left his vast fortune in his world, and had no idea how to return home. As such, he decided to remain in Sigil, and seek his fortune. Or, since he had very little in the way of jink, someone else's.</p>

<p>Elas tried cunning buying and selling. However, due to the enormous amount of people and traders in Sigil, someone always had enough of the goods he was selling. He never got up enough courage to investigate portals to other planes, since he was in no way brave. He had tended to hire other to take his risks for him.</p>

<p>So, he turned to thievery. And, for a while, he did very well. He bubbed naïve berks, he picked pockets, and occasionally mugged people who seemed to have no assisstance or weapons. He wasn't very brave, but he wasn't stupid. He had learned early on in his life that a chiv in the right place tends to make all the difference. As long as it's in his hand and pressed against the berk's heart, it's in the right place.</p>

<p>However, he then made a very bad, very fatal mistake.</p>

<p>He tried to mug a dabus.</p>

<p>He had been watching the dabuses for some time, and he thought that they seemed harmless. What interested him, however, was how they were floating. Due to his completely anti-social nature, he had no idea why they floated (to be honest, neither does anyone else. But they would have told him what the dabuses were, and prevented this), but common sense dictated that it must be some kind of magic ring. By this stage, his greed was overcoming his cunning.</p>

<p>A few days later, he decided to make his move. He saw a dabus go down an alleyway, and followed. When he was behind it, he jumped on it, and held his knife to its throat. "Don't move," he hissed, "or I'll have to slit your throat. And I don't want to ruin my clothes." The dabus attempted to communicate, but Blakeley hadn't a clue what was happening. Suddenly, he realised that another reason why the dabuses floated might be because they were master wizards or sorcerors.</p>

<p>"Stop casting your magic," he snarled, "or you'll regret it." Once again, the dabus attempted to explain. Blakeley became more fearful and, in his fear, he sealed his fate.</p>

<p>He slit the dabus's throat.</p>

<p>The rebuses stop whirling about the dabus's head. Its eyes lost their glimmer. And slowly, very slowly, it collapsed.</p>

<p>There was a gasp from the mouth of the alley. Blakeley whirled around to see that there was a witness to his crime. Blakeley had seen the man before and thought him insane. The man kept talking in the most peculiar way Blakeley had heard.</p>

<p>"Is coming of shadow Lady the razored." he said. "Shadow Barking-Wilder before leave come will."</p>

<p>Blakeley was beginning to get panicky. He had heard what the barmy Xaositect had said, but didn't understand. All he knew was that the only person to have witnessed the murder was a madman without any weapons. He ran towards him. Barking-Wilder ducked out of the way faster than Blakeley thought he was capable of, and Blakeley ran past him into the square.</p>

<p>There was a sudden silence, as if everyone was trying to hide without moving. Or were frozen with bowel-clenching, abject terror.</p>

<p>Blakeley felt someone behind him, and whirled around. Behind him stood a beautiful lady, her face in an expression of perfect serenity. She was dressed in a robe of some strange material, and towered over Blakeley. Blakely noticed the rings on her fingers. And the collar of blades around her throat.</p>

<p>The last thing he saw was the Lady's shadow speeding towards him, as if the sun was rising behind her at tremendous speed. It reached him...</p>

<p>After the screams had died away, some of the dabuses came to remove the gore from the area. It took a while.</p>

<p>Moral: The wise man asks about that which he doesn't understand.</p>

<p>or: Don't mess with the Lady or her dabuses.<br />

          FotP 2: The Dangers of Bub        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><span style="font-style:italic">This one came about just as I finished the first. I thought "Well, Planescape involves a lot more scheming than most settings. So..."</span></p>

<p>It was the bub what did it, Jeremaiah thought sadly, gazing into his mug. He sighed, then knocked it back. Horrible, he thought, what this stuff did to you. Honestly, it was disgusting how much some people would drink. Well, these were the general current of his thoughts. What he was actually thinking was very incoherent. This was because, while bemoaning the addiction of the common people to bub, he had drunk nearly fifteen pints. </p>

<p>He couldn't understand why there were so many multi-appendaged horrors in the bar today.</p>

<p>"That's a lot of drink, friend." said a voice somewhere on his left. It had a sort of sub-pelvical quality. He turned. No-one. He then looked down. It was a long way, and by the time his eyes got there, they felt very tired. He had another drink to stead them.</p>

<p>How strange. Seventeen mutated halflings and two dozen gnomes in a similar state. Must be a convention, he thought.</p>

<p>"Go away, li'l hal'ings and guh-nomes. Not 'nuff yet."</p>

<p>He turned to the barkeeper, who seemed to have changed during the night into some sort of freak. Must be some kind of effect from a random portal, he thought. Or something to do with this damn gatetown sliding into the Beastlands. Oh well. Might as well have some more bub. Wasn't his jink in the first place.</p>

<p>"What's your name, friend?" asked the halfling. "And why are you trying to poison yourself with alcohol?" added the gnome.</p>

<p>"Name? Name's Jeremiah. Rest no' impor'nt." He smiled grimly. "Am drinkin' bub... to forg't."</p>

<p>The halfling smiled. "I'm Garret, and this is Gazden. We've just arrived from a... a Prime, is it?"</p>

<p>Jeremiah thought for a few moments. So, these must be a couple of Clueless. Interesting.</p>

<p>"Wa' doin' here? This Beastl'nds's's'..." He struggled to remember what he had been going to say. It had been very intelligent and witty. Then he remembered.</p>

<p>"... Gatetown. Faun'l." He felt very pleased and, having got his point across so thoughroughly, drained his mug.</p>

<p>Gazden broke in, saying "Well, we were just wondering why you were here. You see, we came here..."</p>

<p>Jeremiah cut in before he'd finished. "... Bah assid'nt. M'st peep' do." He took his new glass from the barman. He was just wondering if the barman knew that he was his special, personal friend, when Garret piped up.</p>

<p>"Yes, so we've heard. But, for someone to drink so heavily, you must have done or seen, or evn not done or seen, something you regret. What happened to drive you to drink?"</p>

<p>Jeremiah sighed. This was the third time someone had asked him that question, and he gave the same answer as before. But less articulatly. "W'n I w's trainin' to b'come a r'nger like m' fath'r. W'n r'nger reach's cert'n age, he'll go innoo..." Jeremiah paused, trying to get the words in order in his head. "... innoo th' Wilds. Fin' 'ims'lf partn'r. Found mine. Name o' Bill. Dire bear. Gr't guy." Jeremiah seemed very close to tears. "Th'n, we was huntin' gobs... Th' bast'rds got Bill. R'nger's h've a link to partn'rs. Wass' called... emphath... empat... EMPATHIC. Thas' th' one. Means we feel each oth'r's... feelin's. Bu' they got 'im. Bill. An..." Here, Jeremiah began to sob. "They tort'red ol' Bill. F'r arrs! Fine'lly, ol' Bill died. Still miss 'im."</p>

<p>At this point, Jeremiah began to weep without restraint. Gazden and Garret looked on for a few moments, perhaps in sypathy, then walked out. </p>

<p>Several metres from the bar, Gazden turned to Garret.</p>

<p>"Anything?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Few hundred coppers. The berk was loaded with jink!"</p>

<p>Gazden whistled appreciatively. "That's enough to get us a promotion! We should give a toast to that bubbin' old cony who," and here Gazden's voice became a mockery of Jeremiah's tear-filled voice "'l'st his onl' fr'nd!'" The two of them laughed, and continued up the street.</p>

<p>They were nearing an alley when Garret grabbed his smaller companion, pulled him into the alley, and in one deft movement slit his throat.</p>

<p>"You can toast him when he joins you in the dead book," Garret said with a smile. "Can't have you barking to a bleedin' Sodkiller, me ol' Adam."</p>

<p>He cleaned his blade, made sure that all of the blood had been cleaned off, then walked out of the alley.</p>

<p>Back in the pub, Jeremiah turned to a figure sitting beside him. The horns growing out of her head and the forked tail swishing marked her as a Tiefling.</p>

<p>"W'll, Sus'nnah, w't they have?"</p>

<p>The girl smiled. It wasn't a nice smile. "They were tryin' to bob you, y'aul bubber. More'n five hundred coppers. Berks gave more'n they got."</p>

<p>She handed him a coin purse, which he put in his pocket. Jeremiah smiled. "Y'r uncl' taught you w'll. G'd work."</p>

<p>A few moments later, a man sitting near the door got up, walked up beside Jeremiah, and quietly paid his bill. A few moments later, he left the tavern. Those fools had as good as handed him their jink, evern though that halfling had been shrewd. As for the tiefling and the human, it had been a lot harder, but he had just needed to keep the girl as far away as possible. Nearly a thousand coppers. He could get some chant from a cross-trader for that.</p>

<p>Moral: Watch your jink.</p>

<p>or: Don't get bubbed in public without a reason.</p>

<p>or: Never underestimate anyone, even if they seem as helpless as a Power at the Spire.<br />

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Originally, there was going to be one switch. Then I thought "Crowded bar... Why not another?" And it escalated. Luckily, I had some restraint, and stopped it where it was. Otherwise, I'd have made half the story about double-crosses and switcheroos. </p>

<p>As well as that, I'd almost run out of nifty ideas for double-crosses.</span></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

          FotP 3: Soddin&#039; Sodkillers        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><span style="font-style:italic">This one started as an idea, after reading the Sodkillers entry in the Factions chapter. What if, someone tricks everyone into thinking there are Sodkillers coming... but was lying, and makes off with everyone's stuff? Then, I rethought, and twisted it. And then twisted it again.</p>

<p>So far, this one's my favourite.</span></p>

<p>"Look out! Sodkillers!"</p>

<p>The room was suddenly filled with frenzied activity. Those knowledgeable enough opened gates and ran through. The others made do with more mundane exits, like those hidden under the floor. And, in a few more cases, the back-door.</p>

<p>Soon, the only one left was the barker. Who smiled, and muttered under his breath "... If you believe the screed a howler like me would say." He then ran over to the nearest stall, and began rooting through it. He knew it would only be a matter of time before the traders came back, and he wanted enough jink to make this escapade worthwhile. With luck, he would end up in the belly of the brick-beast rather than in the dead-book.</p>

<p>His main target, however, was sitting far at the back. Teslyn's Magic Items was unattended, unwatched, and, until now, loaded down with powerful magical items. Now, however, Jerech started loading his Bag of Holding with as much merchandise as he could carry. He knew the value of this haul.</p>

<p>He was going to get one hell of a promotion. And a hell of a lot of jink.</p>

<p>The last thing he snatched was a mimir. He knew that these could be sold for lots, especially to some Clueless just off the Prime. Most people sold them for around 1000 gold, but he'd seen an expert costermonger sell one to a loaded cony for nearly 5000 gold. He reasoned that, if that codger could do it, he could do it better.</p>

<p>He'd packed his bag full to the brim, and was just about to fill his second, when he heard marching outside. He looked out the window, and caught a skeg at a band of Martyrs coming towards him.</p>

<p>"You must be kidding. Someone must have draped."</p>

<p>This was almost as bad as Sodkillers. The Martyrs would drag him in, and then keep him in for a bit. And confiscate all of his takings.</p>

<p>He had to move fast. No time for the other sack. He swung his full one over his shoulder, then made for his own exit. He had a key for a gate to the relative safety of Tradegate. He knew a few good fences, and could flog his wares to them. Anything they wouldn't buy (which was likely very little, he reflected with a smirk), he could flog it himself. Peel himself a few conys...</p>

<p>Suddenly, he pulled himself out of his reverie. The Martyrs sounded a lot closer now. He looked in the pocket he had put the key into. It was gone.</p>

<p>Fear's icy hand gripped his heart. He searched the pocket again. Still nothing. In a panic, he started to search the rest of his pockets, until he realised that the Martyrs weren't going to stop for some poor knight of the post who'd lost his key. He'd have to do it the old way, during the Tempest: he'd have to run for it.</p>

<p>Grumbling to himself, he fled for the back doors. He rushed out of one just as two Martyrs came round the corner. He ran. They chased. Of course they'd chase, he muttered to himself. I ran. So they'll chase. Like Guvners chased after knowledge. The more it eluded them, the harder they'd chase.</p>

<p>He ran into the Hive, passing the Mortuary. If he could get to the Smouldering Corpse, he had a few friends who could help him out.</p>

<p>He turned a corner, and found himself running through the Alley of Dangerous Angles. Dodging and weaving, he managed to avoid the ruins and the Shattered Temple, as well as its resident gangs and barmies, and a number of apparently unaffiliated bashers.</p>

<p>He emerged at the other end, to find, to his utter dismay, some more Martyrs coming towards him. He turned round, and saw that his pursuers were closing in.</p>

<p>Suddenly, a gith ran up to him and grabbed him by the shoulder. "Follow me, cutter, else you want to spend some time in the brick beast."</p>

<p>Jerech followed. He didn't know who this gith was, but anything was better than getting caught.</p>

<p>They ran down several side streets, through several alleys, and, on one occasion, through a veritable field of razorvine.</p>

<p>Finally, they came to a mural the Painter must have worked on. It was incredibly strange, and seemed to bend your eyes inside-out. The gith took out a small napkin from Fortune's Wheel covered with fireberry juice in the shape of an eye. The napkin glowed slightly, and a portal formed in a circular part of the painting. The gith jumped through, with Jerech behind him.</p>

<p>When he came out, he saw a blank wall. He turned, and found, to his utter horror, a red fist on a red disc, with a circular border of green Wyrms. This was the Tower of the Wyrm. The Sodkiller's Sigil base.</p>

<p>His guide grabbed him by the shoulder and drew his sword.</p>

<p>"Well, looks like we gave the pikin' Martyrs the laugh." He smiled. "Now, we're going to give you the rope."</p>

<p>Moral: Never get your key stolen when you need a quick exit.</p>

<p>or: Never go blitzing through a portal without knowing where it goes.<br />
