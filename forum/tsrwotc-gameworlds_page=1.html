         <p>The region was named after Ioun.<br />
Bam. Where's my No-Prize?</p>

<p>Except that Ioun didn't exist before 4E.</p>

<p>As for the elimination of the Blood War, I remember reading somewhere that WotC's primary objectives with 4E was to <br />
A. bring new blood to D&amp;D rather than appease old fans (as the new blood is far more likely to buy the books than the old fans, many of who now have jobs and family to worry about)<br />
and<br />
B. Corner the casual P&amp;P gamer market.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the casual P&amp;P gamers do not care for the Blood War OR the Great Wheel, because they find the idea of several different heavens and hells to be both too complex and pointless.<br />
As I mentioned before, a LOT of the gamers out there don't care for the 1-3x D&amp;D fluff because they prefer to simply have a single heaven, a single hell, a single "team" of celestials, and a single "team" of fiends; they find the Blood War and in-fighting between various celestial and fiendish groups to bee too complicated, confusing, and pointless (and MANY found the yugoloths, eladrins, guardinals, archons and ALL the elemental planes to be boring and pointless, sadly.<br />
I know, it's blasphemy to us on this site, but that's how a lot of people feel.  They find the simplistic and one-sided 4E cosmology and fluff to be far more refreshing, though they don't like it, either, but at least they don't have to do as much work on the cosmology and monster types to make the setting they want.)<br />
The casual gamer thing is also the reason why they're trying to simplify EVERYTHING so damn much (and I think they've gone way too far with Essentials, though I fear that were it not for WotC's confusion over what they're aiming to create with Essentials and their insidious plan to make it so that you have to purchase all 10 books to have a complete set of game rules, the Essentials would likely be incredibly popular, because people just plain suck.  THe fact that the Madden series is so damn popular is proof of this.  We have idiots out there who buy the current year's release of the game which has NO DIFFERENCES WHATSOEVER ASIDE FROM AN UPDATED ATHLETE ROSTER, something which should damn well be downloadable on EA's site for free as a patch.  Oh, and don't get me *and everyone else in this topic* started on the crap that passes as a best seller in music, these days.  I mean, there are good, quality songs in every genre, so why is it that the year's best hit singles are almost invariably the Mcmusic of the genre?  WHY?!?!?!?!?  Moving on).  <br />
A major complaint new gamers have had since the 80's about both AD&amp;D and 3x is that they're far too complicated (especially 3x), that there's far too much bookwork, that there's far too much work for the DM to craft a session (esp. in 1E and 2E).  So apparently, one of the major appeals of 4E is that it's exponentially easier to DM, and that the powers system makes it easier for the players to keep track of how much and how long of each spell/what have you they have left for the day/etc. (though honestly, I don't have any complaints about the Powers system mechanics in 4E)</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>There's a couple of different explanations for ioun stones already. In the Forgotten Realms setting, they were named for the Netherese arcanist <a href="http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Congenio_Ioun" class="bb-url">Congenio Ioun</a>. I assume origin stories will always vary from world to world. Who can say what world is correct? Maybe none of them, or all of them.</p>

<p>There's enough worlds and pantheons in 1-3rd edition that Ioun might easily have existed somewhere without any of the published sources mentioning her. There's plenty of room for incalculably ancient towns, sites, and realms in the infinite planes of existence that no one's heard of before. She could even share Pelor's realm, as she does in 4e. The 4th edition story of Erathis trying to knit together the Outer Planes into a vast lattice and failing because of the Dawn War would probably not be true in the Planescape cosmology. That's okay. We can pick and choose our inspiration. It still might be a myth that her followers believe to be true.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Well, no, because I mean that:</p>

<p>1. No power with such a name or portfolio was ever mentioned in any of the core versions of D&amp;D or AD&amp;D<br />
2. The core setting already has an explaination for the ioun stones, which it has had since 1E-- Ioun is the name of the region between Mineral and Positive, where the stones are naturally created.  <br />
3. 4E claims that the goddess Ioun has been in the limelight/played a central role in the core setting's multiverse for centuries if not millenia.  However, since 4E core does not take place centuries after 3x core, then this is an impossibility-- a retcon.  This is as opposed to the Raven Queen, who achieved apotheosis by stealing it from other powers during the space between 3.5 and 4E.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Who can say what world is correct? Maybe none of them, or all of them.</span></p>

<p>Well, considering that the Crystalle version is the Planescape version, I would say that IT and the Gemfields/Ioun region of mineral would be the correct version.  The Crystalle stuff from Dragon 174 wasn't unofficial either, since Crystalle gets mention in Inner Planes, by name, and it states that he's an archomental.</p>

<p>As for the 1E differences, 1E was more of the prototype of the D&amp;D, so a lot of things were different, such as the "Commune" and "Summoning" spells creating spheres and shepherd's crooks on other planes that lured natives like flies to honey (which admittedly is a pretty dumb concept).  The whole Sigil thing and the like would be more a case of "the knowledge simply wasn't available to the players back then" on the three main prime worlds.  It would probably be akin to Spelljamming in 2E-- most adventurers, even the most intrepid, would never learn anything about them.  Planar travel OTOH seems to be something that sages and monster hunters know a bit more about, probably because it's interwoven into their society's mythology and also because many adventurers eventually get attacked by ethereal creatures.  OTOH, the average elf, beholder, or mindflayer is not a spelljammer, nor does it know anything about spelljamming-- the beholders and illithidae are, for the most part, culturally naturalized.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">There's enough worlds and pantheons in 1-3rd edition that Ioun might easily have existed somewhere without any of the published sources mentioning her.</span><br />
Sure, if she just sat there and never did anything, including not doing anything in regards to the Ioun Stones-- after all, in 2E, Crystalle is the guardian of the gemfields and the ioun stones.  Crystalle cannot possibly be her agent because his sub-portfolio does not match hers-- he is not particularly interested in wisdom.  Crystalle's sub-portfolio is greed, wealth, authority, the advancement of mineral quasielementals and indigenous natives, keeping Mineral pure, and possibly ambition.  (much like Imix's sub-portfolio is arrogance, passion, lust, and wrath-- and Olhydra's is the wrath/anger of a stormy sea, and the unpredictability of the sea.)<br />
Unfortunately, that is not what 4E claims.  <br />
Not only that, but now, suddenly, Kossuth, Istishia, and even Zaaman Rul are evil and always have been.  <br />

         <p>Nope. Kossuth, Istishia, and the other elemental rulers are mentioned in the 4e Forgotten Realms campaign guide. They're unaligned.</p>

<p>Zaaman Rul and the others haven't been mentioned at all in 4e materials, but if they were I don't think they'd be evil. There are a number of examples of non-evil primordials. </p>

<p>The article first linking ioun stones to the Plane of Mineral (and introducing Crystalle) was in Dragon #174, so it was firmly in 2nd edition.</p>

<p>I certainly wouldn't turn Crystalle into a minion of Ioun, but visitors from the Prime worshiping Ioun might still have named the border with the Positive Energy Plane after their goddess. </p>

<p>It's a big, big multiverse, and there's plenty of room for undiscovered goddesses, even if they didn't always stay quiet and do nothing. "The knowledge wasn't available to the players back then" is exactly the way to look at it. </p>

<p>4th edition is clear that the Raven Queen has been a goddess for eons. She killed Nerull long, long ago. As with the Ioun thing, I wouldn't think of this as a retcon, but as a setting-specific truth. One thing to keep in mind is that the core setting is just one possible 4th edition setting. Forgotten Realms, Eberron, and Dark Sun are others, and the goddess Ioun isn't part of any of those things. Planescape is historically tied with the Forgotten Realms, though, so FR lore has priority over general 4e lore, as far as I'm concerned. </p>

<p>But Planescape is enormous, and deities like Ioun, Erathis, and the Raven Queen could well be part of it. They wouldn't be pivotal - the setting is too big for any single god to be pivotal, particularly not a single-sphere deity like Ioun or Erathis. But they could be there, and they could even find their way into planar nomenclature. Things like that happen. Amerigo Vespucci wasn't really that important an explorer, but he still gave his name to two continents.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Hyena, this is why I was saying that stuff earlier about Ioun.  There's three things you can do when you have a canon contradiction like this.  You can complain about it, you can ignore it, or you can resolve it.  The first doesn't actually accomplish anything and would just tick off your GM (or, if you're the GM, would just confuse your players), and I know you hate to do the second, so why not do the third?  Instead of talking about why it doesn't mesh with canon, make up an explanation that allows both to be true at once.  Figure out how to take the contradiction and make it non-contradictory.  That's what I do when I decide not to ignore a contradiction.  And doing this more often than not makes things <span style="text-decoration:underline">more</span> interesting.  You've said before how detail-oriented you are; well, this would allow you to keep even more details at once.</p>

<p>I mean, let's take your objection to its logical conclusion.  By the logic you're presenting here, no game designer could <span style="text-decoration:underline">ever</span> introduce anyone of any import to an existing setting without a timejump, because there would be the question of "if they are this important then why did we never see them before?".  And that is honestly kind of ridiculous.</p>

<p>So!  We have these details about different sources for the name "Ioun".  Instead of complaining that they introduced a new explanation yet again, why not just figure out a way that they can all be true?  Then everyone's happy.</p>

<p>(Plus you know the 4e core setting isn't necessarily the same setting as the 3.5 core setting anyway, right?)</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Yes, it is.</p>

<p>I can think of no way to resolve this.  Crystalle and Ioun aren't compatible, since IIRC Ioun is good-aligned and an earth deity (and you know how Crystalle treats earth elementals.  Hint: prettymuch the same way that everyone else on Mineral does).  The powers in 4E core have too great a role over their environment to be compatible with earlier versions of the core (the main example that comes to mine is the sterility of female devils in 2E vs. ability to reproduce sexually in 3x; I don't see this as a contradiction because in the Planescape setting, it's clear that the Player books, and even many of the DM books, are meant to be read like Sigilian booklets, pamphlets, posters, word on the street, and faction education for tourists, initiates, and such.  So one can easily just claim that the available information at the time was incorrect.).  Of course, with the Elemental Chaos BS, WotC will probably just make it so that Crystalle and Ioun control DIFFERENT mineral regions rather than have a single region that's mineral-aligned.  Which of course I think is a load of crap, just like everything pertaining to, and the very existence of Elemental Chaos.  <br />
There is only so much retcon and contradiction that I can deal with.  The differences/contradictions between 2E-3x are tolerable; it's easy to come up with explanations for why the contradiction exists or which version takes precedence.<br />
With 4E, everything is so radically different that there's just no way to resolve it without turning the official 4E fluff on its head (well, the remainder that isn't absolutely gutted however).  This is something I prefer NOT to do; I do my best to stick to canon and simply expand upon what the official sources give me to work with.  The only times I've ripped it apart is in instances of very minor nuances that just seemed to stupid to me to allow to exist (such as Ice Paraelementals not having the icewalking extraordinary ability-- we're supposed to believe that ice paraelementals can't maintain their footing in their own native habitat?  Other times I've merely converted stuff to the 2E fluff/statistics/what have you, which I don't view as really gutting the fluff all that much since in most cases WotC clearly designed things in a way that 2E and 1E fans could easily revert it to 2E cosmology/etc.)</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Nope. Kossuth, Istishia, and the other elemental rulers are mentioned in the 4e Forgotten Realms campaign guide. They're unaligned.</span></p>

<p>I was told they were made into Primordials however, which would make them evil.  Perhaps that tidbit comes from a core book rather than a FR book?</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Yes, it is.</div></p>

<p>It really isn't. The 3.5 core setting was nominally Greyhawk. The 4e implied setting is the Forgotten Kingdoms (aka the Fallen Lands, or Points of Light, or the World), which has a different pantheon, cosmology, history, and creation myth. Greyhawk's world of Oerth has two moons; the 4e implied setting only has one. The two settings are as different as Eberron and Toril, which both incorporate elements of Planescape into their cosmologies. </p>

<p>They don't need to be. All they have in common is a name. Names aren't always logical. Naming a region of Mineral after her in no way requires that she actually have any authority over that region, let alone over Crystalle.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>(the main example that comes to mine is the sterility of female devils in 2E vs. ability to reproduce sexually in 3x</div></p>

<p>As far as I know, that only applies to erinyes, which 3.5 made separate from the baatezu hierarchy anyway.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div> WotC will probably just make it so that Crystalle and Ioun control DIFFERENT mineral regions rather than have a single region that's mineral-aligned.</div></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">The Plane Below</span> introduced regions called the Pillars of Creation, nigh-infinite columns of elemental material that  correspond to the old elemental, paraelemental, and quasielemental planes. They're not infinite, but they bring back a fraction of the old flavor of having regions of pure elemental material believed to form the foundation of the cosmos.</p>

<p>But Ioun wouldn't control any part of the Elemental Chaos. Her realm is Hestavar, which she shares with Pelor and Erathis (and which corresponds to Light's Blessing/the Fortress of the Sun in Elysium). </p>

<p>You're mistaken on the idea that primordials are necessarily evil. They're not. Examples of non-evil primordials include Akadi, Istishia, Kossuth, Grumbar, and Mual-Tar the Thunder Serpent. All are listed as "unaligned."</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Exactly.  The city of Phoenix doesn't have any phoenixes there, or any tradition of phoenixes in its history.  Corpus Christi, Texas was never a major Christian historical site.  You're a northwesterner, I'm sure you've heard the story that Portland, OR was named in a coinflip between that and Boston.</p>

<p>Just because a place has a name doesn't mean the thing that name was derived from had to have any big association with the area.  The region of Ioun doesn't have to have derived its name directly from the god Ioun just because they both have the same name.</p>

<p>Here's another idea: maybe that article was wrong.  Maybe ioun stones didn't get their name because they were from the region of Ioun.  Maybe Ioun was named because it was a source of natural ioun stones.  And so some time far down the line, people confused the etymology and thought the stones were named after the region.  That sort of thing happens all the time in languages, folk etymology can hold pretty firm. (Constable On Patrol, anyone?) After all, did that article say why Ioun was called Ioun?  Did it explain the source of the word "Ioun" as regarding the name of the region?  Or did it just push back the explanation one level and say ioun stones were called that because they were from Ioun?</p>

<p>Sometimes you need to be creative to resolve a contradiction, but except in rare extreme cases, it can always be done I think.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Note that I said natural ioun stones.  It could be that Ioun created the first ones artifically, and then later it was discovered that there was somehow a natural patch there.  Like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_nuclear_fission_reactor" class="bb-url">natural nuclear reactors</a> in the Oklo mine in West Africa; artificial came first as far as people were aware, and then someone found it could be naturally occurring through certain rare conditions.</p>

<p>This would also explain why it's possible for mages to create them as magical items and yet still have them come naturally from a region of the plane of Mineral.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>I agree Vini (well I should hope so, I am the OP!).  I just feel that most of what we see today are fairly lame attempts to recapture the magic from this era.  And I'm trying really hard to look at this without bias, as I know I must be coming off as someone who is stuck in time and refusing to budge.</p>

<p>I compare it to modern movies.  How many films now are made that aren't simply ripoffs of 80's/90's IPs?  If it isn't a remake of an 80's movie, it's a TV show, or a graphic novel, etc. - Transformers, A-Team, cripes even really <span style="font-style:italic">bad</span> 80's properties like Hawaii Five-O are getting the remake treatment - it reeks of desperation and a total lack of originality of today's writers.</p>

<p>Part of me is thrilled at the prospect of such amazing settings like Ravenloft and Dark Sun getting facelifts for the next generation - I feel they have some wonderful stories that very well should be passed along..... but conversely, I'm almost afraid to see the hack job that will be done on them.  If they're re-imagined in anything like the minimalist, dumbed down manner that the current cosmology is compared to the Great Wheel - I'd rather they not even bother - it will simply be an offense and an insult to my memory of these classic settings.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>That's exactly how I feel, as well.  I think, even from an objective "look at it like a separate game rather than a D&amp;D incarnation" PoV, they've gone way overboard on "keep it simple" with the Essentials series.

         <p>Hello berks, cutters and planewalkers!</p>

<p>I hope you'll forgive a relatively young D&amp;Der for planeshifting into this topic, but I just wanted to throw in my two coppers. My sole experiences with D&amp;D happened a decade ago at the age of  twelve, back in 3rd-3.5 ed. and sadly not one of the guys I played with ever mentioned a single campaign other than Forgotten Realms. In 2009 after an unplanned 9 1/2 year hiatus due to troubling developments in my personal life, I discovered the Planescape and Dark Sun settings/ </p>

<p>I'm not ashamed to admit that I sat at my desk and bawled. So much beautiful creativity and good old fashioned writing hit me to the core as an authour. Ever since, my writng has never been the same and for the first time in my life I am now playing D&amp;D........as a Dungeon Master. I would never have discovered these settinga if it weren't for the love and dedication of the fan community here on the forums to keep it alive. Writing is one of the few creative outlets that has been helping me cope with the death of my father six years ago and I consider this place a literal life-saver.</p>

<p>Here's a salute to all of you and may Planescape live forever!</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I think the worst bunch to be caught up in what's canon and rules and mechanics happen to be be 4e players.  But the problem isn't with 4e itself, it's with the fact that there's players stuck on whatever the most current stuff is from D&amp;D who have no initiative and imagination for themselves.  If there was a 5e, most of them would be caught up in the rules, mechanics and canon material of that edition.</p>

<p>As for original material that's recent, there is some original stuff.  But it's been a common trend to go towards remakes in Hollywood in the last few years.  At least it gives movies from other countries more of a chance now.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

I remember one of the sources like the 4e Manual of Planes or maybe even one of the designer interviews mentioned that the Primordials were not necessarily evil.  Though many of the other designers don't seem to work that way.  But 4e FR was the place that definitively named some Primordials who weren't evil, and gave stats for that one who wanted peace with the Gods, but had rage issues whenever he woke up.</p>

<p>Of course some Elemental creatures suffer from inconsistent descriptions too.  Like for example the Elemental Archons (ignoring the fact they're using the name of the LG outsider race) are constantly described in a manner that would make the Unaligned/Lawful Neutral but are statted as CE and have a very bad description for why they are that alignment.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Hey, the last decade was pretty cool too.  Just off the top of my head I can name Mouse Guard, Nobilis, Progenitor, NWoD Vampire/Werewolf/Mage/Changeling, Eberron, Exalted, Unknown Armies, Dark Heresy, Rogue Trader, Ptolus, Burning Wheel, and Star Wars Saga Edition.  The 00s had just as much cool gaming stuff going on as the 80s and 90s, I think.  Personally, I'd even go so far as to say I'd match Greg Stolze alone up setting for setting against any other single game creator. <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/lol.png" title="Laughing out loud" alt="Laughing out loud" class="smiley-content"/></div></p>

<p>Idran, I respectfully disagree. See, from the ones you mention, some are remakes (Wod, Star Wars), while others sound really derivative/generical to me (Nobilis is like a more artistic Amber; Ptolus is just a medieval city with flair; Dark Heresy and Rogue Trader just a colorful Traveller variant; Burning Wheel is an generic fantasy ). Not that I consider they bad games - far from it - just not that original. </p>

<p>But I totally agree about Greg Stolze and Unknown Armies. <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/wink.png" title="Eye-wink" alt="Eye-wink" class="smiley-content"/> </p>

<p>P.S: by the way Idran, I think the indie scene this last decade have been much more prolific ideas-wise than the traditional one.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

I agree Vini (well I should hope so, I am the OP!).  I just feel that most of what we see today are fairly lame attempts to recapture the magic from this era.  And I'm trying really hard to look at this without bias, as I know I must be coming off as someone who is stuck in time and refusing to budge.</p>

<p>I compare it to modern movies.  How many films now are made that aren't simply ripoffs of 80's/90's IPs?  If it isn't a remake of an 80's movie, it's a TV show, or a graphic novel, etc. - Transformers, A-Team, cripes even really <span style="font-style:italic">bad</span> 80's properties like Hawaii Five-O are getting the remake treatment - it reeks of desperation and a total lack of originality of today's writers.</p>

<p>Part of me is thrilled at the prospect of such amazing settings like Ravenloft and Dark Sun getting facelifts for the next generation - I feel they have some wonderful stories that very well should be passed along..... but conversely, I'm almost afraid to see the hack job that will be done on them.  If they're re-imagined in anything like the minimalist, dumbed down manner that the current cosmology is compared to the Great Wheel - I'd rather they not even bother - it will simply be an offense and an insult to my memory of these classic settings.</div></p>

<p>Exactly my feelings, Viking.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Eh, there are several 3rd party gameworlds that are pretty original, though I don't know how well they were implemented, mechanics-wise.<br />
Violet Dawn/Avadnu, Etherscope, and Dragonmech are the main ones that spring to mind.  I've also seen a few Science Fantasy/crossgen books, though I have no clue how they compare mechanics-wise, either.<br />
Though not a setting, the Redhurst Academy of Magic is another really good book (some argue it's the best 100% 3rd party D20 book out there).  It basically just describes the academy in detail, but...!  We also learn that the academy can jump between prime worlds.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>vini_lessa</em> wrote:</div>Idran, I respectfully disagree. See, from the ones you mention, some are remakes (Wod, Star Wars), while others sound really derivative/generical to me (Nobilis is like a more artistic Amber; Ptolus is just a medieval city with flair; Dark Heresy and Rogue Trader just a colorful Traveller variant; Burning Wheel is an generic fantasy ). Not that I consider they bad games - far from it - just not that original. </p>

<p>But I totally agree about Greg Stolze and Unknown Armies. <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/wink.png" title="Eye-wink" alt="Eye-wink" class="smiley-content"/> </p>

<p>P.S: by the way Idran, I think the indie scene this last decade have been much more prolific ideas-wise than the traditional one.</div></p>

<p>True, but come on, if you're going to hassle me about including remakes and derivative works, I have to point out that you included CoC, Battletech RPG and Star Wars d6.  Even CoC; it was awesome, but not exactly an original setting.  <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/tongue.png" title="Sticking out tongue" alt="Sticking out tongue" class="smiley-content"/></p>

<p>(Plus I wouldn't say NWoD is a remake of OWoD, I'd say it's OWoD done right <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/lol.png" title="Laughing out loud" alt="Laughing out loud" class="smiley-content"/> )</p>

<p>Also!  If you like Stolze, I'd definitely recommend you check into Progenitor too.  It's his new setting for ORE, my friend's been raving about it for the last week or two, and everything about it sounds really cool.</p>

<p>Oh, speaking of Stolze, that reminds me of something I noticed earlier that I was kind of curious about.  We've done a lot of talking about what settings we like, how great the writing was for them, and so on, but hardly anyone's actually talked about the writers themselves.  I mean, Planescape's cool, but it's cool in large part <span style="text-decoration:underline">because</span> of Zeb Cook, Wolfgang Baur, Colin McComb, and Monte Cook.  I mean, DiTerlizzi and Dana Knutson are certainly to thank too, but the writing's just as important.  So I'm curious; for the people here that do love Planescape, what do you think of their other works?  Open Design Project for Baur (it might be open creation, but he's still been lead designer for most every product as far as I'm aware), Ptolus, DungeonADay, or the other stuff put out by Malhavoc for Monte Cook...well, I can't really name other major RP products spearheaded by McComb or Zeb, they sort of dropped out of the designer role after 2e.  McComb's done some writing, but mostly modules, and it's weird to say "did you love Beyond the Vault of Souls" in this context.  And I don't really know any RPG stuff at all Zeb's done outside computer gaming since 2e.</p>

<p>(And I know there were other writers, but...well, to be entirely honest, besides Bill Slavicsek, I don't really know anything they've done since Planescape at all.  And I don't think Slavicsek was ever <span style="text-decoration:underline">that</span> involved in the setting, though I still love Harbinger House more than I should.)</p>

<p>But anyway, I'm rambling!  Basically, I'm wondering if the love of the old settings talked about here translates into the newer stuff the guys that made them have done since those days?  Do you guys keep following the writers involved on those old settings and do you still enjoy their work nowadays?  Not just for Planescape either; I can't really talk about the designers in other settings since I don't know them as well (Greyhawk some, but not really any of the others), but did any of them make you follow the writers around to other projects as the settings faded?  And if not, why not?</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>From what I've read of the Golarion, the core Pathfinder Campaign Setting it's quite a derivative campaign setting.  But in my opinion it's stills a good one, even if it's not entirely original.  The Campaign Setting guide which I skimmed through mainly so I could decide on where my character came from, was quite a well written book.  Even though I can clearly see there are various fantasy counterpart cultures, and there's places that reference other fantasy works out there, including the one with the crashed spaceship.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Hoo boy, there's currently a big hooplah over this article.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/issues/issue_271/8109-Red-Box-Renaissance" title="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/issues/issue_271/8109-Red-Box-Renaissance">http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/issues/issue_271/8109-Red-...</a></p>

<p>This is prettymuch how people of 4E feel (and, even though I don't like 4E overall, I have to massively agreee with them that this sucks, as it prettymuch takes away the only good stuff about the system)</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">* It looks like Heinsoo, not Mike Mearls, was responsible for all the good stuff in 4e circa 2008 that massively set it apart from past editions and gave it a unique focus. The power system, the refusal to focus on simulating a particular fantasy setting, generally a lot of the awareness that D&amp;D is fundamentally a rules system and that players can bring a lot of the rest of the stuff to the table...came from Heinsoo, not Mearls.<br />
* It looks like the entire time, Mearls has been unhappy with things like every class using the same power progression, and now that he's lead designer and in charge of Essentials, he's specifically changing it to bring back the style of play in TSR D&amp;D and 3.5. I'd always thought that the Essentials decisions had been made way above Mike's head, and that he was just doing his best to put the nice spin on it, but more and more it sounds like his brainchild.<br />
* Definitively, absolutely, positively: Essentials is built around the promise of bringing back people who ragequit D&amp;D.</span></p>

<p>Also, other comments I agree with:</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Doesn't matter whether a new edition is better or worse, I can't see how chaining it back to the old one can't make it worse than both.</p>

<p>What they have successfully done is create a situation where everyone loses, regardless of who buys or does not buy the product.</span></p>

<p>Yeah.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>OK, there's been many many posts in thsi thread and I don't have the time to read them all, so I'll just add my personal experiences to the discussion. I firmly believe that the late 80's - mid-90's era was the most creative period in (A)D&amp;D history, and it is unlikely to be surpassed in the future. I have absolutely no desire to concern myself with anything related to 4E D&amp;D, so I really doubt that any future product will evoke the same feelings of joy and wonder ever again.</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, my favourite setting is Planescape. As the OP said, it is indeed the greatest achievement in D&amp;D history. I was initially exposed to Planescape during a Forgotten Realms campaign in which all players were novices (or "semi-novices") to serious roleplaying, but the DM was a veteran and a keen roleplayer. While we started with the simple mentality of building a character and killing monsters and taking their stuff, we were quickly shown the light, as we were encouraged to provide al sorts of "unnecessary" (rules-wise) information, such as character background, descriptions of personality traits etc. To make a long story short, I can still remember my amazement and sense of wonder after our first Planescape session, which was spent in a single district of Sigil. To me, it was a revelation. It was a world of infinite charms and endless opportunities for roleplaying. It was a world which practically begged for mature players, because the maturity of the themes it entailed functioned as a strong deterrent to casual, "chop-shop" gaming. At the same time, the perfection of Planescape made all other settings with which I was familiar with back then (FR, Greyhawk, Dragonlance) pale in comparison. Planescape made AD&amp;D look as if it had somehow evolved into something far greater, a leap forward in an imaginary "rp scale". So, it must be clear by now, Planescape will never be bested, at least in my books. And I must add that the fact that Planescape was released in the 2E era, with its "light-on-rules, heavy-on-fluff" mentality, made it so much enjoyable (of course, no offence meant edition-wise).</p>

<p>Ravenloft comes as a close second, because it entails all the above but presents more limitations, which can be enjoyable in certain contexts but in the long run they detract from the sense of wonder and infinity that Planescape induces.</p>

<p>Dark Sun was for me a wonderful break from the rest but not suited to long campaigns. It was a bit, shall we say, monotonous after a point.</p>

<p>I haven't got anything meaningful to say about Mystara and Spelljammer. Greyhawk, however, was clearly not the best D&amp;D setting. I can't say I have enjoyed my forays in Oerth. After Planescape and Ravenloft, far too simple...</p>

<p>Birthright had a strategy feel and this turned me off sometimes. Nonetheless, it was a great setting and the production quality of the supplements was enormous (high quality, evocative full colour illustrations on every page).</p>

<p>So, that's my $0.02.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Yeah, I also love Birthright, and as a matter of fact it is still connected with the planes( it has, for a sample, the "core" demon lords and Moradin). It mostly feels disconnected because Of the Shadow World between Aebrynis and the Astral Plane.</p>

<p></div></p>

<p>Silverwizard,</p>

<p>It's almost like you were one of the players at my table!  I was tasked with putting together a campaign for 5 players - 2 of which hadn't played D&amp;D, and the other 3 having varying degrees of understanding of the D&amp;D settings and lore.</p>

<p>Well, having copious amounts of Planescape material at my disposal, there was no way I wasn't going to use at least some of it.  However, the thought of plopping this "green" crew smack in the middle of Sigil seemed like a recipe for disaster.</p>

<p>Instead I billed it as a Forgotten Realms campaign.  Even the rawest of my players knew who Drizzt Do'Urden and Elminster is, and was at least marginally familiar with locations like Shadowdale, Baldur's Gate, Waterdeep, etc. - most likely by exposure through the Black Isle/Bioware video games.</p>

<p>It became clear, after a few levels and as the plot advanced, that this story arc was going to span other prime worlds and indeed other planes of existence.  I pretty much used FR as a means to ease them in, get the newer players up to speed, and allow the party to gel.  I sprinkled in elements of Ravenloft (as a fun October side adventure that had nothing to do with the main arc) and a tiny bit of Dark Sun as well, though the main focus of the advanture eventually shifted to the Inner and Outer Planes.</p>

<p>It's funny.... Planescape is by far my favorite setting, and yet I've never actually run a <span style="font-style:italic">Planescape</span> campaign.  Rather, I use it as a glue to hold the entirety of the D&amp;D setting together - a backdrop to explain the relationships and means of traversing all other destinations.</p>

<p>This is why I was (and am) against messing with the overall cosmology like 4ed did.  It is also why I was angered when Forgotten Realms tried to depart from this cosmology in favor of their own (which was easy enough to ignore).  And especially why I get annoyed at Weis and Hickman for their insistence that Krynn is not a part of the greater cosmology - though I enjoyed RipVanWormer's deconstruction on that point.</p>

<p>I simply can't abide with having all these products not under the same "roof" so to speak.  There's way too much excellent crossover opportunities to allow them exist in mutually exclusive universes.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

Basically, aside from the Abyss, the Elemental Planes, Ethereal, and I think Astral (and also 1 additional outer plane IIRC), the 3x FR cosmology consisted of something sorta like a "sephiroth" of sorts made up primarily of 2E divine realms such as Heliopolis and Nishrek.  Aside from 2-3 "all inclusive" "planes" such as "House of Nature" and "The Fugue Plane", it was incredibly easy to place any new deities and planar monsters into the D&amp;D or even 2E cosmology.  The 3x FR cosmology also wasn't implemented in a way that made it the least bit difficult to completely ignore it and simply use the generic 3x D&amp;D cosmology provided you had the Planescape books + Faiths &amp; Avatars, Demihuman Deities, and Powers &amp; Pantheons.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>So now that I know we've got some cutters in house with vast amounts of knowledge (not limited to just the PS setting) let me pose the following scenario to you.</p>

<p>I've got a side project going (I'm not even sure what form it will eventually take - a story, a pnp module, a Neverwinter online adventure...).  I won't bog you down with all the hows and whys, but it basically boils down to a group of adventurers that are assigned with the task of travelling back to certain key periods in each setting's past - not necessarily to change history - but to observe and collect data that will be relevant to problems faced in the current timelines.</p>

<p>Now, the problem is - how do I select a moment from each game world that is considered a critical or iconic moment?  Well that's where you guys help me of course!!</p>

<p>For <span style="text-decoration:underline">Darksun</span>, I've chosen a somewhat vague period during the Green Age, when defiling magic is just starting to strip this lush, vibrant world.  Characters will be present to see the very beginning of the downward spiral Athas is then plunged into.</p>

<p>For <span style="text-decoration:underline">Forgotten Realms</span> it is a journey back to the magical kingdom of Netheril, where the archmage Karsus researches and casts his ultimate 10th level spell - <span style="font-style:italic">Karsus's Avatar</span> with disastrous results.</p>

<p>For <span style="text-decoration:underline">Dragonlance</span> the players are sent to ancient Istar to witness the Kingpriest, in all his hubris, make his foolish demands to the gods - resulting of course in the horrifying Cataclysm.</p>

<p>The above, while not set in stone, I'm reasonably sure of and would only change if presented with a much more tantalizing prospect.  The following three I'm struggling with:</p>

<p>In <span style="text-decoration:underline">Ravenloft</span> I've chosen the night of Sergei and Tatyana's wedding, wherein Strahd Von Zarovich slays his brother and attempts to woo Tatyana, only to see her hurl herself off a cliff in grief - thus forming the first dark domain of Barovia.  I'm not completely attached to this idea, but I prefer it over the Grand Conjunction.</p>

<p>When it comes to <span style="text-decoration:underline">Greyhawk</span> I will confess my ignorance.  I don't know enough about the setting to make an informed choice.  With all the talk in the other thread about the War of Law and Chaos - I thought about using that here - as the Rod of Seven Parts has always been a key component to Oerth's history, no?  But does this really capture the feel of Greyhawk?  Even though a key battle was fought on the field of Pesh, this happened in such an age of antiquity, I don't know that it really conveys the essence of <span style="font-style:italic">Greyhawk</span>.</p>

<p>And then of course, there's <span style="text-decoration:underline">Planescape</span>.  It's such a large and intimidating setting/history, I don't know where to begin.  Perhaps the aforementioned War of Law and Chaos?  Even though it's historically linked to Oerth, it is a world's spanning event that is more closely <span style="font-style:italic">Planescapian</span> in terms of scope and impact.  Or would you go with something more toned down and intimate to Planescape?  Perhaps the Lady's faction decree?  This seems a pretty formative moment in Sigil's history.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>The faction shakeout seems to be the best for particular Planescape relevance.  For one thing, it definitely happened in and around Sigil, rather than any of the other worlds on your list.  </p>

<p>The Battle of Pesh was a <span style="font-style:italic">universally</span>-shaping event; it almost ranks up there with the Creation, and might be as difficult to pin down to a well-defined time, given that it probably took place across multiple worlds (including some of those where you already have events).</p>

<p>The fate of Vartus Timlin and the Expansionists, who seem to be regarded as having been a serious threat to Sigil, might also constitute a possibility.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><span style="font-style:italic">When it comes to Greyhawk I will confess my ignorance. I don't know enough about the setting to make an informed choice. With all the talk in the other thread about the War of Law and Chaos - I thought about using that here - as the Rod of Seven Parts has always been a key component to Oerth's history, no? But does this really capture the feel of Greyhawk? Even though a key battle was fought on the field of Pesh, this happened in such an age of antiquity, I don't know that it really conveys the essence of Greyhawk.</span></p>

<p>I'd go with either that or the original entrapment of Tharizdun, which might not necessarily take place in its entirety on Oerth.<br />
The Battle of Pesh might be a tad difficult for the players to witness since this battle consists of innumerable elementals and outsiders battling against one another, including several quasideities (including Ogremoch vs. Sunnis, which was a double-knockout nearly killing both.  Since Sunnis and Ogremoch are the strongest of the Archomentals, this is going to be quite a wave of destruction.  These two quite literally pummel each other to pieces.)</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">And then of course, there's Planescape. It's such a large and intimidating setting/history, I don't know where to begin. Perhaps the aforementioned War of Law and Chaos? Even though it's historically linked to Oerth, it is a world's spanning event that is more closely Planescapian in terms of scope and impact. Or would you go with something more toned down and intimate to Planescape? Perhaps the Lady's faction decree? This seems a pretty formative moment in Sigil's history.</span></p>

<p>Actually, I would envision the big event would be The Lady vs. Aoskar, but like the aforementioned Law/Chaos war, it may not be possible for the players to safely witness this, since at bare minimum you're talking about a fight to the death between a power and a quasipower.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>For Sigil, I might go for the imprisonment of the unnamed wizard (later named Gifad, later Rowan Darkwood) in the Labyrinth Stone by the Lady of Pain. Watching the wizard begin the Sigil Spell that he thought might destroy the Lady, only to be imprisoned in a gem and cast into Pandemonium, might be suitably dramatic. This was 11,000-20,000 years ago.</p>

<p>Even more dramatic might be the activation of the Shadow-Sorcelled Key, which opened portals to the Lower Planes all over what was then called the Prime Ward, transforming it into the Lower Ward and causing armies of fiends to overrun the city. It's hinted that the key was activated by the immortal usually called the Nameless One, perhaps at the behest of Ravel Puzzlewell. Because the Incanterium, Sodkillers, and Expansionists were factions at the time, it must have been over 1,000 years ago.</p>

<p>The Great Upheaval around 630 years ago might also work. In Planescape in general, you might try the casting out of law and chaos from the yugoloth race with the Heart of Darkness, the creation of the slaadi Spawning Stone, the banishment of the titans to Carceri, Nemausus sliding into Mechanus, or the battle between Gith and Zerthimon.</p>

<p>For Oerth, I'd probably go with the Rain of Colorless Fire as the defining moment of the setting. Transparent flame rained down from the heavens as part of a curse by the Baklunish mage-priests, turning soil, vegetation, people, and even rocks to ash and transforming the mighty Suloise Empire into the caustic Sea of Dust. I'd have the PCs either appear in the Suel capital, which was magically protected but got buried in ash and dust, or with the twelve noble houses at the edge of the empire with the archmage Slerotin and his apprentices just as Slerotin was opening a 100-mile tunnel into the mountainside so that he could lead them to safety.</p>

<p>Other possible Oerth moments include the sinking of the Isles of Woe, the destruction of Sulm, Tzunk opening a portal to the City of Brass in the Burning Cliffs, the destruction of the Sinking Isle, the battle between Vecna and Kas, the last battle between Lum and Leuk-o, the imprisonment of Zuggtmoy at the Battle of Emridy Meadows, the casting of the Invoked Devastation, and the battle between Iggwilv, Tsojcanth, Iuz, and Graz'zt that ended with Tsojcanth bound in an Abyssal rift, Graz'zt banished, Iggwilv stripped of her powers, and Iuz transformed from a handsome apparent human to a creature split between a withered old man and a bloated demon form. The Battle of Pesh happened entirely on Oerth, though the law-chaos wars were waged across many worlds and planes. The Six from Shadow helped Tsojcanth bind Tharizdun on Oerth in his temple in the Yatils, though that was probably just an avatar. Tharizdun's true form was bound eons before, before the battle of Pesh, in the Ethereal Plane.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Eberron certainly has an ancient timeline starting from creation to the campaign standard of just a few years after the Great War.</p>

<p>I think it's something like the 3 dragons Eberron (Earth), Khyber (Underdark/Abyss) and Siberys (the Heavens/Stars) coexisted and then Khyber killed Siberys and Eberron entrapped him, effectively creating that world.  Then came the Age of Demons when the Rakshasa ruled before they were defeated by the Coatls, followed by the Age of Giants who fought off the invasion from Dal Quor by sealing the portals and knocking that plane off of it's "orbit".  There was then the Goblin Empire of Dhakaan who fought against the invasion of Xoriat (Far Realms) with the help of the Orcish Gatekeepers.  The fallen Goblin Empire was then colonized by a bunch of Humans fleeing from the continent of Sarlona, resulting in the rise of Five Nations of Khovaire (the default campaign location) and the Inspired's Empire of Riedra.</p>

<p>A good point of past history sometime in Eberron I think would probably be during the Goblin Empire of Dhakaan, though I think that's at least a 1000 years in the past.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>I must've been thinking too hard on this subject when I went to bed last night, because I dreamed about the Lady vs. Aoskar.  I woke up this morning thinking that is such a better fit than the Law/Chaos war, and couldn't wait to get to my computer tonight!</p>

<p>I agree with you 100%, especially on the point that such conflicts are not meant for mortal eyes.  Perhaps this scenario can take place shortly after the Lady gives Aoskar the boot.  They could investigate the aftermath, which I'm sure would still be very heavily charged with residue from such a titanic struggle.</p>

<p>Ok, I feel a lot more settled on the Planescape scenario now.  Lady vs Aoskar as the top option, with the Faction Decree as a backup plan if I can't work out all the details.  Now I just need to square up on the Ravenloft and Greyhawk scenarios, and I can begin the next phase.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

For Oerth, I'd probably go with the Rain of Colorless Fire as the defining moment of the setting. Transparent flame rained down from the heavens as part of a curse by the Baklunish mage-priests, turning soil, vegetation, people, and even rocks to ash and transforming the mighty Suloise Empire into the caustic Sea of Dust. I'd have the PCs either appear in the Suel capital, which was magically protected but got buried in ash and dust, or with the twelve noble houses at the edge of the empire with the archmage Slerotin and his apprentices just as Slerotin was opening a 100-mile tunnel into the mountainside so that he could lead them to safety.</p>

<p>Other possible Oerth moments include the sinking of the Isles of Woe, the destruction of Sulm, Tzunk opening a portal to the City of Brass in the Burning Cliffs, the destruction of the Sinking Isle, the battle between Vecna and Kas, the last battle between Lum and Leuk-o, the imprisonment of Zuggtmoy at the Battle of Emridy Meadows, the casting of the Invoked Devastation, and the battle between Iggwilv, Tsojcanth, Iuz, and Graz'zt that ended with Tsojcanth bound in an Abyssal rift, Graz'zt banished, Iggwilv stripped of her powers, and Iuz transformed from a handsome apparent human to a creature split between a withered old man and a bloated demon form. The Battle of Pesh happened entirely on Oerth, though the law-chaos wars were waged across many worlds and planes. The Six from Shadow helped Tsojcanth bind Tharizdun on Oerth in his temple in the Yatils, though that was probably just an avatar. Tharizdun's true form was bound eons before, before the battle of Pesh, in the Ethereal Plane.</div></p>

<p>Wow, lots of info there for me to digest.  While I like your first suggestion (Rain of Colorless Fire) I think it too closely mirrors some other scenarios I'm already working with:</p>

<p>In Faerun I have the end of Netheril.  As Karsus casts his master spell, he temporarily suppresses the magical weave, causing the floating sky-cities of that empire to come plummeting down.  On Krynn I'm utilizing the last days of Istar, and the coming Cataclysm - wherein the gods hurl a fiery mountain onto the city - piledriving it down to the depths of the Blood Sea.  So as you can see - I already have enough of the <span style="font-style:italic">death from the skies</span> theme covered.</p>

<p>The next paragraph has so many possibilities contained within.  As I stated, I'm lost when it comes to Greyhawk history, so I have a hard time ranking those in terms of overall popularity/impact/iconicity to that world.  I will say that as a non-fan of the setting (which doesn't mean I dislike it, only that I never devoted much time to it) the one I recognize with the greatest ease is the conflict of Vecna and Kas.  I guess I have some serious research to do - but thanks for setting my feet on some kind of starting path.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Can anyone provide some products I might peruse to find some more depth on the Lady vs. Aoskar and/or Vecna vs. Kas conflicts?</p>

<p>I've done some half-hearted searching on the internet, but all I seem to come up with are short wiki stubs that contain only a paragraph or two.  I have the general idea already, what I need is to delve deep into these two events and get some serious detail - what sequences of events led up to these conflicts, some blow-by-blow analysis of the fights themselves, and of course a whole lot more on the aftermaths.</p>

<p>Anyone know of any links or downloads (preferably free) that do more than scrape the surface?  I need to immerse myself fully in these events.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Vecna's defeat was only a thousand or so years ago, barely part of the modern historical period (though this history is brutally suppressed by the Silent Ones and the Knights of the Watch, partly in an attempt to cover up the complicity in Vecna's reign by one of the ancestral houses of Keoland). <a href="http://www.canonfire.com/cfhtml/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=29" class="bb-url">Here</a> is a brief short story I wrote on their final battle a long time ago. Rereading it now, the major mistake I made was not realizing that Citadel Cavitius already existed then, and Kas was imprisoned in it rather than dying. The bit about Vecna "exploding" wasn't too unreasonable, though. 4th edition sources say that Vecna was at the verge of becoming a god and Kas sought to replace him.</p>

<p>Anyway, <a href="http://www.fraternityofshadows.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&amp;t=6722&amp;start=0" class="bb-url">this thread</a> at the Cafe de Nuit summarizes the relevant sources on the subject pretty well. The biggest problem the PCs will have in visiting that era is that Vecna will probably be aware of their intrusion and seek to send his followers through the same portal they're using into the modern era.</p>

<p>Aoskar is harder. We don't really know when it happened, and not everyone agrees that it happened in Sigil. If it just involved her attacking him from another plane remotely, there may not have been anything to see. I interpret "casting him out of the Cage" as meaning he was physically inside the City of Doors in an Age where the Lady still permitted this, but not everyone does.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>There are a <span style="font-style:italic">lot</span> of alternative takes on the Lady of Pain (often mentioning Aoskar) on the Mimir's <a href="http://mimir.net/ladyofpain/dark.shtml" class="bb-url">Darker Chant on the Lady of Pain</a> (you might also find the other sections interesting). </p>

<p>Some samples: </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>I am sure you have heard that Sigil has gates leading to every place in the multiverse, while this maybe true it is not all their is to know about the city of doors. Sigil is infact the largest gate in the multiverse. The great ring-shaped city itself is a gate. The Lady of Pain knows this because she was sent to replace the insubordinate former ruler of Sigil, Aoskar.</div></p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>"Still, a martyr though she may have been, she found the Pain only grew with the years. She spent her life in agony, experiencing the fierce ravages of her child at the slightest action. She had to lift her burden by passing it to another. Now, at that time there weren't any creatures strong enough to take the Pain. She tricked Aoskar, her old enemy, into taking it, but it killed him, and he was a Power! The only other thing big enough was the Multiverse itself, so that's what she did."</div></p>

<p>And from <a href="http://mimir.net/ladyofpain/planewalker.shtml" class="bb-url">Planewalker's Tales</a>:<br />
<div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>"The Lady is Aoskar. See, Aoskar, Master of Portals, decided that his take on 'life' was too simple, too 'good,' and he decided to make things a little harsher in Sigil. So he created a manifestation of himself called the Lady of Pain and then had her destroy his original self."</div></p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>"The Lady of Pain and Aoskar were once husband and wife, and they ruled the city of doors together. One of them went insane/cheated on the other, and in the ensuing violence Aoskar was slain and his temple shattered. What a glorious explosion that must've been. I wish I'd been there to applaud it."</div></p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div></p>

<p>    "The Lady used to be a Power, but she got into the way of Aoskar. Aoskar devised a trap for the Lady. She was lured into the Cage of Sigil and lost her divinity there. Aoskar instructed his priests to pray to the Lady just to torment her, because he had made sure she wouldn't receive power from it. (That's why the Lady flays people who pray to her)."</p>

<p>    "Through her contacts with the Dabus she managed to slay Aoskar and completely destroy his temple. Although denied of her former powers she received the power formerly held by Aoskar: The control over portals. On the other hand, she might just be a blob of Chaos Soup, teleported by accident to Sigil and taking on a permanent form because it isn't expected to do so."</div></p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div></p>

<p>    "Almost true, but...The Lady was actually in love with Aoskar. Aoskar was more so in love with the Lady. Aoskar was a very jealous power, so he trapped the Lady in the Cage to make sure she wouldn't see another man so powerful as he. The Lady was so angered by this, she decided to recruit the Dabus to help her escape.</p>

<p>    "Alas it didn't quite work the way she thought: The combined power didn't destroy her chains, it destroyed Aoskar who maintained the Cage. She is now so deep in sorrow, that she doesn't speak and in memory of Aoskar she swore never to leave her Cage again."</div></p>

<p>And the basic information from the <a href="http://mimir.net/ladyofpain/primer.shtml" class="bb-url">Primer</a>:<br />
<div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>The Lady's reach is far, and it's just as powerful. Once, an upstart power named Aoskar, a god representing travel, fortune, opportunity... and portals. Aoskar became a sort of sponsor for the City of Doors, and everyone respected him as greater than The Lady, for he was indeed the master of portals throughout the multiverse. The Lady didn't seem to care about this thought that was in the hearts and minds of the people living in her city... until a dabus dared to cast on the robes of Aoskar as his priest. The Grand Temple of Aoskar was shattered into a thousand pieces, and everything within a six-block radius was destroyed by the sheer wrath of the Lady of Pain. As for Aoskar himself... well, a new corpse was sent to the Astral Plane. Some Astral travellers even say that his astral corpse is impaled through with The Lady's Blades. Since then, powers stay out of Sigil. Their priests can come in, their proxies are barely tolerated... but powers find themselves blocked.</div></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Here's one I wrote, as a tie-in to Malhavoc Press's <span style="font-style:italic">Beyond Countless Doorways</span>, tying Aoskar to the Nexus of that supplement.</span></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">On the Origin of the Nexus</span></p>

<p>In the beginning there was the Rose; her buds and thorns made up the whole of the multiverse. Her blossoms were the blossomings of worlds; her roots and stems transversed all boundaries.</p>

<p>From the Rose was born Aoskar, the Opener of Doors. The Rose was Aoskar's teacher, parent, and friend.</p>

<p>"Rose," said Aoskar sadly. "The time has come that I must leave. I must seek the new places you have told me about, that the inhabitants there may find their way to you."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Rose. "It is time. Good journey, beloved Aoskar." Before he left, though, the Rose gave him a gift: a tiny, flowering vine that she named Folly.</p>

<p>During Aoskar's long wanderings, before he found his throne in Sigil, he sought an oracle to show him the path he must take. He consulted the Norns, and the Gray Sisters, and the Sibyls of Elysia, but none would say what the destiny of the god might be. "Your future is hidden from us," hissed Skuld. "It is guarded by Pain."</p>

<p>Shekinester, triple-goddess and World Serpent, divined something of Aoskar's fate, and harried him and his servants with her ha-naga proxies. "Is it war she wants?" mused Aoskar. "I can give it to her."</p>

<p>"I would be careful," cautioned Folly. "She is strong, and old. Better to attempt to bargain."</p>

<p>Aoskar followed Folly's advice. Calling in a favor from a being called the Wandering Architect, he had a sumptuous meeting-hall built. In it, he opened a number of doors that would allow him access to all the powers that he had within the Rose itself. Sending a two-headed hound to Shekinester's Court of Light, he invited the Three-Faced Queen to complete the hall with her own powers, and meet him on what would be neutral ground.</p>

<p>Intrigued, Shekinester did so. The meeting-hall became a place of seemingly endless maze-paths reminiscent of her own Loom of the Weaver. The goddess herself appeared within its heart. A young girl with reptilian features floated to the entrance and bade Aoskar walk in.</p>

<p>Venturing through the maze, half familiar and half new and strange, Aoskar felt his own doors change and twist. He felt as if the Rose was calling him somewhere, or warning him, but her words seemed jumbled, reduced to incomprehensible symbols that floated through the streets of an alien city, building and rebuilding its walls and doors. And in the center of it all, a circle of blades. Something about them filled him with terror.</p>

<p>"You should go back," said Folly. "The Rose wants you out of this terrible place."</p>

<p>"I can't," said Aoskar. "This is my destiny. If I leave now, I'll never understand it."</p>

<p>And so he passed the tests of the Empowerer, and passed into the presence of Shekinester herself.</p>

<p>"You have great courage," whispered the goddess, her human face shifting from young to old and in-between. "You will need it, where you are going."</p>

<p>"Is this why your minions have been harrying me?" Aoskar asked. "So you could warn me?"</p>

<p>"Not warn, merely test. I wondered what kind of god would go to dwell in the City of Doors. None have done so since the Phoenix's last death."</p>

<p>"Were your questions answered?"</p>

<p>"Almost," said Shekinester. "Before we are finished, you must face the Arching Flame."</p>

<p>As if struck by the same impulse, Aoskar and the serpent-goddess embraced, his limbs circling her coils, her coils circling his limbs. Aoskar's two faces looked into Shekinester's three faces: maiden, mother, crone. Then she was a pillar of light, and he and she were one.</p>

<p>After an infinity of union, the light faded, and Shekinester was once again a three-faced naga. Aoskar was once again a dual-faced man.</p>

<p>"I feel cleansed, healed," said Aoskar. "I wish we could merge forever."</p>

<p>The Empowerer laughed; the Preserver smiled gently; the Weaver sneered. "We each have our destinies to fulfill," they said. "But this place we have made will remain. As will one other."</p>

<p>The girl who had met Aoskar at the first door reappeared. "Farewell, Father," she told him.</p>

<p>"A child has been birthed from our unity," Shekinester explained. "Dislocated slightly in the warp and weft of history. Meet Aoska-Shek, for the second time."</p>

<p>Aoskar awkwardly patted his daughter's head. Something about her made him uncomfortable; probably it was the way her feet never touched the ground.</p>

<p>He turned to look at Shekinester, but she was already gone. Shrugging, he left the Nexus they had made and went to meet his destiny.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Interesting, but I my have missed the underlying intention (if there was one) under the prose. I haven't seen <span style="font-style:italic">Beyond Countless Doorways</span></p>

<p>Shekinester has aspects of a destroyer (clearing the way for the new), an initiator into harsh truths that make one stronger, and (as the guardian of the light with which Aoskar merged) a preserver of the existing order.</p>

<p>Did you see the creation of the LoP as a needed cleaning out of an older god? Was the LoP a revalation of the truth/prevalence of pain in the multiverse? Is the LoP intended to be a being of constancy in a changing multiverse? Or is the LoP just the unexpected by-product of a strange divine union? </p>

<p>I realize that you will probably be tempted to respond with a "Interpret it as you will"/"Any/all of the above" type answer but if you had a concrete purpose for the creation of the LoP, I'd be curious to hear it (just to understand how you approached things. In terms of gameplay, I'm sure we all argee that there should be numerous stories going around with no certainty about any of them).</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Ha, everyone who isn't familiar with <span style="font-style:italic">Beyond Countless Doorways</span> seems to interpret Aoska-Shek as the Lady of Pain, which is logical given the context and perfectly fine if that interpretation interests you. My intention was that she's actually a completely separate being: she takes the place of the character Niveral-Sca, daughter of Niveral, Lord of Secrets, and Sisansca, Sister to Serpents (and guardian of the Nexus). The story was basically just my way of tying the character more closely to the Planescape mythos with deities that I thought were close approximations (and more interesting, I think, than Monte Cook's deities Niveral and Sisansca).</p>

<p>Shekinester initiates Aoskar into his destiny, destroys him, and preserves the multiverse as it was before he arrived from his alien cosmology of roses. And from their brief union is born a quasi-divine being with power over the portals of her own strange realm. It would be interesting if this was the Lady of Pain, or if people only thought it might be. But by my intention, it isn't.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">
