          New Player Character Race: Ortho Orcs Part 2.0        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
        <div class="dice_rolls">
</div> <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Motmur (Ortho Orcs)</span> </p>

<p>	The Motmur were, long ago, very much like other Orcs of other lands.  They worshiped Gods of Chaos, tortured, and slaughtered in the name of their Creators with very little civilization to call their own.  That was when the Baatezu came and forced the orcs into 'slavery' that resulted in their transformation from brutish cannibals into a vast and powerful civilization that dominated much of Ortho.</p>

<p>	The Motmur Orcs' brutal Lawful and Organized ways were anathema to the Knights of Harmony's idealism but the massive warrior tribes were not disposed to waging war with them.  The Motmur had no love for the Chaos worshipers that were the Harmonium's enemies and offered the hand of frienship to the fledging organization.  In a rare show of pragmatism for a paladin, Prince Romhel decided to accept their aid.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Personality</span>: The Motmur are an incredibly proud people that tend to conduct themselves with an intense swagger when dealing with smaller beings.  The Motmur are, justifiably, proud of their incredible racial accomplishments and are annoyed at any race that cannot cite their lineage or what heroes that they are related to.</p>

<p>Motmur tend to place a great deal of value on family, masculinity, and physical prowess.  Their culture is rigidly organized with a tendency towards patriarchy rather than military organization.  Motmur obey their King, their Tribal Chiefs, Their Fathers, and their Elder Male Relatives in that order.  This has resulted in a great deal of difficulty with integrated military units and obeying non-orc overlords but few will gainsay the power of the Orc.</p>

<p>Motmur are, by and large, a violent people that tend to view other races with a great deal of stereotyping and various forms of derision.  They place a good deal of importance on personal "honor" though that boils down to keeping one's word and protecting one's war companions.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Physical Description</span>: Motmur are physically imposing as most Orcs but tend to be much better armed and much better equipment.  The Motmur have access to the same technology as the rest of Ortho and do not disdain it.  However, their clothes are of a distinctly more grandiose and bombastic attitude than most Ortho flare.  Motmur have a preference for capes, grand colors, and other trappings of royalty when not in armor.  Black and Red are especially common for their bloody connotations.</p>

<p>While it is incomprehensible to most non-Motmur, Orcs have a rigidly defined station that their clothing helps identify.  Anything from gold enameling one of their tusks to the number of earrings on a snout has important meaning that must be backed up.  An Orc that acts outside his station is often severely punished.  Body art is especially common amongst Orcs with many choosing to paint elaborate murals of their deeds if they are especially accomplished.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Alignment</span>:  Motmur are Lawful Evil for the vast majority of their race.  Their culture swiftly trains them that one's loyalty is to one's race, one's kingdom, one's family, and the OCA in that order.  They tend to view the suffering of other races with distinct callousness and view non-warriors as good only to be servants.  Few individuals that are Lawful Good can stomach the causal brutality that is a daily part of Motmur growing up.  </p>

<p>Those who are not lawful tend to find themselves swiftly branded as 'Afrial' which means both 'honorless' and 'dung.'  Countless Orcs have been conscripted to work houses by their own people for seemingly minor transgressions against their family's honor.  Lawful Neutral individuals are not uncommon but tend to be sent away to work with the Harmonium for their comparatively balanced world views (that Motmur culture views as weakness).</p>

<p>Only in Xaric does a Neutral or Chaotic Orc have a chance of a peaceful existence.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Motmur Lands</span>: The Province of Motmurk is dominated by the Orcs and one that they have shaped as their own homeland.  Any non-Orc that comes into that domain is taking his safety in his own hands.  They are a powerful presence in many other lands as the Orcs of Motmurk have founded many communities in other Provinces to expand the reach of their race's dominance.  By and large, they are viewed as troublemakers.</p>

<p>Orcs are especially plentiful in Xaric but tend to have a most Un-Orcish relationship with Dwarves due to the ancient enmities that characterize Motmurk's relationship with Orcs being absent from them.  The two races are able to live in relative peace.  Strangely, the Orcs of Xaric tend to far less lawful than their Motmurk cousins and even tolerate the chaotically inclined.  This has lead to a strange conflict between the 'Pure' orcs of Motmur and their 'honor-less' cousins that have 'forgotten their pride.' The Xaric hold nothing but loathing for their Motmurk cousins and fights are quite frequent when they meet.</p>

<p>The only province that Orcs are almost absent from is Northern Thaera.  The Hobgoblins' former service to Alzrius has not been forgotten by the Orcs despite six hundred years.  Worse, the Hobgoblins total submission to the state and totalitarian tendancies contrasts sharply with the Orcish love for family and personal glory.  The fact that both compete to produce the greatest warriors of the Harmonium has made the two races almost impossible to work alongside.  The Orcs are much more influential than the Hobgoblins but are deeply vexed at how powerful they've become.  Orcs who settle in North Thaera have a tendency to meet unfortunate 'accidents.'</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Religion</span>: The Orcs tend to worship Didairdin almost exclusively amongst the Lords of Order.  The God of Guardianship and Children is still the God of War amongst the Motmur and they see very little need for any of the other deities.  The exception is Tyerusus whom is paid homage by Orcs that have reason to fear death or disease.  Most female orcs tend to revere Ina instead of Didairdin.</p>

<p>A substantial number of Orcs maintain superstitous reverence for their former Baatezu masters.  The Lords of the Nine Asmodeus, Bel, Baalzebul, Belial, and Mephistopheles are all revered by substantial numbers of cults or in secret prayers.  This religion is not tolerated by the OCA or Harmonium with Sin-Hunters frequently dispatched to commit large scale burnings against them (usually these are Orcs out of respect but not always).</p>

<p>The Orcs have a superstitious dread of the Lords of Chaos and Alzrius.  They tend to react to such things with genocidal fury.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Languages</span>: Orcs tend to speak their own language almost exclusively in Motmur.  A number of Orcs have learned Ortho Common despite the fact the language is rarely used inside the homeland.  Learning other languages is largely viewed as an indulgence.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Names</span>: Orcish names tend to be more primitive sounding than most Harmonium ones.  They tend to come in three parts with one's given name, One's Greatest Accomplishment, and One's Clan.  Thus it might be Gotar Dragon-Killer Iron Tusk.  Women have much more simple names with their given name and clan.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Adventurers</span>: Almost all Orcs are Fighters on Ortho.  Most Orcs are rigidly lawful and have moved beyond their Barbarian past with such types being viewed with disgust for their base natures.  Orcs tend to make poor Rangers and Paladins with both professions requiring an introspective nature that they lack.  </p>

<p>Likewise, there are few Sorcerers and Wizards amongst the Orcs.</p>

<p>Orcish Rogues are the next most common type of Orcish adventurer.  The profession of Thief is viewed with scorn and derision but many Orcs find that it is easier to gain through cunning than through force.  Orcs from Xaric have no social stigma against rogues and accept them as equals alongside fighters.</p>

<p>Despite their relative lack of skill compared to humans, Orcs tend to revere the clerics that live amongst them.  They wield a disproportionate amount of influence and power that is the only source outside of proper clan lineage.</p>

         <p>We have a lot of stuff about Orcs already written in the Motmurk section of the PDF. We should make sure this conforms (although looking over it, you clearly wrote this entry with Motmurck in mind). Also, are we sure the orcs in Xaric fight the dwarves? I know the Motmurckians do terrible things to the dwarves in their lands, but I thought the whole point of Xaric was that it was more tolerant than that.</p>

<p>Also, the official Harmonium stance on slavery is that it's criminal at best and traitorous at worst. Individuals are supposed to be beholden to the state and the state alone. Dishonored orcs can be imprisoned, abused, or <span style="font-style:italic">treated</span> like slaves, but outright legal bondage is out of the question. I'd suggest sticking them in workhouses instead. That way, everyone wins.</p>

<p>Other than that though, your writeup looks pretty good. I think we just got the best developed orc culture of any setting ever (except possiby Eberron). Keep up the good work.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Nice wirteup. Civilised orcs with an arrogant swagger in their step is a great image. I do have one point, but its not a comment on the writeup per say: </p>

<p>I think I'd like to see Orcs a little bit nicer than they are presently. As Charles pointed out somewhere else, part of the OCA's problem is that it has a lot of evil races prominent in it. In order to give a balanced view of Ortho (as in the 'three versions of Ortho' in the PDF - obviously I'm talking about the nice one here), I think that at least one of its evil races should have made the transition to (generally) Lawful with Good Tendancies - a hands down 'win' for the paladin-types that give the Harmonium its good name, and a way to justify Romhel's alliance with the Motmur in the first place (still highly questionable). I <span style="font-style:italic">could </span>do this with ogres, but orcs are such iconic footsolders of evil that I think they'd have a much better impact. Plus I think I've seen Harmonium orcs in PS material in a couple of places, and they were Lawful Good - can't say for sure though (it was as a player).</p>

<p>I don't think there'd be much work to add this feeling to the orcs as they stand: the Devil Worshippers are already secret cults and lingering superstitions, and the orcs' biggest character flaw arrogance - well, that's hardly restricted to non-Good races.</p>

<p>Just my thoughts.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>And the weres don't count as that transitioned poster-child race? <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/wink.png" title="Eye-wink" alt="Eye-wink" class="smiley-content"/> Of all of them, I would have through they nailed that on the head. I think we've tied too much LE to the orcs to make that sort of polishing up easy, we are talking about a culture where polite assassination is one of the options for advancement. The beholders on the other hand may have some space to grow.</p>

<p>I'll admit on some level I find it difficult to try to try alignment to a <span style="font-style:italic">species </span>as a whole - a society's inclinations, yeah, sure - you can see trends in that - but individuals - at least in my gamestyle - are up to themselves. So the orcs have a LN with some E and some lesser G feel in my head, and it can be hard to try to emphasize a racial alignment as if it were different than the cultural one. </p>

<p>It may be easier to highlight the overall alignment of a species, without boiling them into stereotypes, by our use of them in adventures, hooks, and NPC stats. That a good orc/were/whatnot is not the 'one or two' exception to the rule outcast by the rest of their society for their actions for example, but that we have a good smattering of them, accepted and involved in the internal cultural conflict. A highlight of that sort of mentality - in the PSCS writeup on Blight, check out the Orc household on the edge of town.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Yes, I'm not helping because Hobgoblins are Nazi-Spartans and I tried to be explicit about that.</p>

<p><img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/lol.png" title="Laughing out loud" alt="Laughing out loud" class="smiley-content"/></p>

<p>Well it's a trope of Star Trek too.  Just assume that whenever we say Orcs, we actually mean the Orc culture and that very few are ever raised outside it's mono-culture.  Bluntly, Orcs 1.0 were an attempt by me to separate the Orcs NOT raised in Motmurk from everywhere but they came off as titanic wimps (which was a good thing you stopped me from, guys).</p>

<p>And honestly, Armoury, I think Ogres or other Lawful Good+ 'evil' races would be good.  You know, the Holy Gnolls of Ina!</p>

<p>My only recommendation, really, is we accept that the Harmonium has a lot of really evil guys or that we add YET ANOTHER new race (Insect Dwarves) or maybe a group of enlightened super-humans (perhaps for the new Province replacing the Greek One) that are SUPER-Lawful Good to balance it all out.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Uhhh, the Xaric I read clearly read that the exiled clans were probably guilty of crimes that made the MOTMURK orcs blanche.  Thankfully, some of these crimes were probably cowardice, theft, or other Chaotic Acts but they seemed very clearly to be the Orcs whom are more CHAOS than Good aligned.</p>

<p>Also, I worry that we're justifying the Harmonium too much too.  The races might have made improvements but The Ortho guidebook also shows people with Gulags, Brainwashing and mass murder.  The Harmonium may be based on Arcadia but that doesn't mean it's GOOD.</p>

<p>It's a group that may well be right intentioned and made of good people but a force for evil throughout the cosmos.  I prefer the morally ambigious version but NOT an ultimately good version.  We need Harmonium successes but if we make it ultimately clear they're "good" then we run the risk of justifying all the atrocities.</p>

<p>They're the Technocracy from Mage, the Republic of Haven from Honor Harrington, or Baron Wulfenbach from Girl Genius.  They may give you peace but only if they grind the human spirit in the process.</p>

<p>It's up to you if that's worth it.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

I think we've tied too much LE to the orcs to make that sort of polishing up easy, we are talking about a culture where polite assassination is one of the options for advancement. The beholders on the other hand may have some space to grow.</div>
I realise that I've probably missed the boat on this one but couldn't systematic, state sponsored assassinations help the race to be LN.</p>

<p>I'm thinking something like the Morag Tong in 'TES 3 Morrowind' where crippling and bloody inter-house conflicts are now resolved through a quasi-religious, state approved assassins guild which resolves inter-house conflicts by taking contracts on nobles who have offended the honour of other houses.</p>

<p>This way only one person dies (the one responsible for the slight) rather than a small army, and every ones 'honour' is upheld. It's an idea that I could see working quite well for one of the formerly evil societies on Ortho.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I'm about to head out to dinner so can't respond in full - but that is an aspect that came up on Cherrhy's Foreigner series, which was in my head at the time of the initial writing. Mind you,  I don't think the OCA as a whole would allow, which is why it wasn't something I included. But a traditional role in the past? Or a semi-kept secret that the bodyguard guild may or may not perform? Perhaps. I would avoid the religious aspect though as I would think it brings too much of a conflict of interest into that sort of a societal position. It also just doesn't - I dunno - seem to fit in my head? If that makes any sense? I would rather see a group with that function doing so for pragmatic, secular reasons than for spiritual. And I'm not sure any of the Lords of Order would back it.</p>

         <p>Absolutely, I'd drop the religious aspect for most of the members (that side of thing could be covered by the sin-hunters) and make it a compromise made between the traditional values of honour among orcs (ie. I kill you if you offend me) and the desire for peace espoused by the KoH. </p>

<p>It's a quick and easy solution which the orcs would like because if you're tough enough you've nothing to fear from the assassins and the Harmonium would be ok with because it prevents needless bloodshed and disorder. Having the group controlled by the state is another sweetener for the Harmonium because it means that only 'just' contracts will be carried out.</p>

<p>And hey, according to the BoED assassination’s positively righteous and sanctioned by Celestia if it’s for a just cause. <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/tongue.png" title="Sticking out tongue" alt="Sticking out tongue" class="smiley-content"/></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Call me crazy but the flavor text of Motmurk and other parts explicitly makes orcs out to be bastards, pardon my language.   I say that we stick to that.</p>

<p>Let's remember Ortho is an adventuring setting despite its one world government.</p>

<p>While we could make Ortho a paradise as an OPTION, the "Canon" Ortho we present is an adventuring setting.  It's a setting filled with Feuding Orc Clans, Fascist Nazi-Spartan Hobgoblins, Evil Demon Cults, and all the other goodies that make it easy to adventure in.  The OCA is a deeply flawed institution that may or may not be worth saving.  Clearly though, the flaws are self-evidence and the Orcs as is are a part of that.</p>

<p>I think we've done enough by making Orcs a playable option.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Okay.</p>

<p>One question then, does this apply to Hobgoblins too?  Cause, really, they're almost universally a race of bastards and I personally rather like them that way.</p>

         <p>Same here. Hobgoblins have their own niche which I'm fine with.</p>

<p>As to the "adventuring setting" - remember that utopia or hell hole, Ortho's <span style="font-style:italic">mainly </span>pacified, quiet, and tame. That's the whole point. Orcish culture should be nasty, but nasty on what I'll call for the sake of argument "a human scale" - as in, those vikings aren't very nice, but when they come in peace we trade with them. </p>

<p>Orcs must remain a viable member of society. If they're merciless, ambitious warriors who use assassination as a tool of advancement then that doesn't make them worse than say the Romans - or any less civilised (this avoids the Drizzt problem too). They've also been part of the OCA since the beginning, so we should be careful to avoid cultural stasis problems - while they might once have lived in tents, these days they have cities like everyone else.</p>

<p>PS: I like the idea of Xaric orcs being decidedly less evil (these days) than their Motmurk cousins.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Hi Charles. You replied while I was editing my post, so there's more to it now. </p>
