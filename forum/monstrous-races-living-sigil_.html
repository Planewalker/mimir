      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>spell weaver: </p>

<p>Well, the spellweavers were apparently deeply interested in language, specifically semantics. So I imagine they'd be really interested in learning about different kinds of languages, as well figuring out ways to combine different kinds of spells as well as different kinds of magic styles (true names, pact binding, shadow mysteries, spell fire, even chronomancy though it's forbidden in Sigil).</p>

<p>urdefhan:</p>

<p>Well, do you want them to be creations of a fiendish race? Technically daemon refers to yugoloths, but these races aren't exactly the same in terms of goals. Perhaps they exist to further the aims of daemons who dwell in areas where evil, via the undead, has tainted the normally neutral alignment of the Negative Material Plane?</p>

<p>So those living in Sigil are working to further the aims of Entropy, working with the Doomguard?</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>spell weaver - fantastic idea - it could be trading in true names, secretly researching the Sigil spell, maybe the words of power from Pathfinder: Ultimate Magic could work for them</p>

         <p>I like the idea of having the spellweavers look into the Sigil Spell and the words of power from UM!</p>

<p>reigar: I see them serving the Lady's Ward, providing all sorts of goods to varied clientele. Likely they are rivals of each other, competing for patronage among Sigil's Golden Lords. They also likely create works to delight the Chaosmen, though it's just as likely that they are annoyed when Xaositects deface their publicly displayed works. Reigar likely hang out with varied factions for artistic inspirations, but probably gravitate most to the Indeps and Sensates in my humble opinion.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Dark Ones: Eventually I'll have my extensive write-up about the Dark Ones.  But I've always seen tribes of Dark Ones living warrens in Undersigil, where they raid the City Above hiding away because of the Schism that turned the ancient Children of the Light into Dark Ones, Humans and other races.  Sigil in ancient times when they were part of the Children of the Light was one of their most sacred places they all made pilgrimages to.  When the Schism happened many of the tribes were stranded in Sigil, and have decided to remain there ever since.  Now as the Dark Ones they're confined to Undersigil spiteful and bitter of the curse that was inflicted on them.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>reigar - great suggestion - additionally I thought about the Beatification League (in Dragon #216) as a sect, they're not a complete joke, play down the decorating, they could focus on enchantment magics and search for universal esthetics - if there is something beyond the beauty in the eye of the beholder </p>

<p>One way I considered dealing with multiple cosmologies is to change the structure of the planes, organize them by cultures. Most portals in Sigil would lead to the Great Wheel, then to the Greek, Celtic, and Norse plane.

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><span style="font-weight:bold">derro</span><br />
The derro of Sigil would be known as the expert mechanics and alchemists that they are except for the small fact that they're, for the most part, completely insane. Derro neighborhoods in the heart of the Hive and deep beneath the city streets are avoided by most citizens, feared as a source of bad luck and Far Realm taint. </p>

<p>Few are willing to deal with the derro on a regular basis. The githzerai, on occasion, will patronize them under the theory that their people were also once enslaved by the illithids. Githzerai tend to feel more comfortable around chaos and madness than most, anyway. Apart from githzerai, the clients of the derro are the completely desperate souls who feel they have no other choice, or berks as insane as the derro themselves. </p>

<p>Derro tend to align themselves with the Xaositects, the Doomguard, and the Bleak Cabal.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">dark ones</span><br />
The dark stalkers, dark creepers, and dark slayers are most commonly found in the Hive Ward and in shadowtowns beneath the Lower Ward where they mingle with other inhabitants of the Plane of Shadow. Dark ones retain ties to their home plane as well as their ancestral hatred of fire and light. They scavenge for their food or find work as burglars, touts, factotums, messengers, and assassins.  Proxies of sun gods are targets for their rage and feelings of betrayal; even though the dark ones of Sigil are no longer technically exiled to the Underdark or the Plane of Shadow, they tend to haunt parts of Sigil that are essentially places of exile themselves. They carry chips on their shoulders the size of Carceri.</p>

<p>Occasionally they're willing to deal with the derro, in particular looking for alchemical goods that don't involve fire or light.</p>

<p>Dark ones tend to align themselves with the Dispossessed sect from Pandemonium, though a few have joined the Athar, claiming to have been betrayed by a sun god long ago.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">ethergaunt</span><br />
The ethergaunts seek nothing less than the destruction of the Outer Planes, not to mention the Prime. They craft weapons that utterly annihilate belief and souls and unleash plagues that turn entire worlds into dust. They appear in Sigil rarely, searching for rare goods or meeting in private with their mysterious allies, the nerra and the spell weavers; the most recent appearance was an attempted full-out invasion a few years back, when a rakshasa, a bronze dragon, a rilmani, and a drow with mechanical wings were foolish enough to bring a creature into the city that grew into an embryonic deity. Before the Lady of Pain showed up to maze or flay everyone, the ethergaunts were defeated and the newborn god managed to escape into another plane. </p>

<p>Normally, ethergaunts do not openly show their masked faces in the city. The Athar are said to have some contacts with them, and one might show up to trade their strange alien technology with the Godless, but it's clear to anyone with half a brain in their brain-box that when their plans come to fruition, the ethergaunts will kill all the Athar too. </p>

<p>There may be a handful of ethergaunts living in Sigil for the long term, living in disguise while they use Sigil's otherworldly energies to charge a device that might extend the Spire's anti-magic aura across other planes, or destroy the Spire entirely. In the short term they seek to turn religious orders against each other, to destroy their reputations and wipe them from existence. They hate most races, but sometimes enslave illithids to use as pawns in their schemes.</p>

<p>The oldest planars remember the time a few thousand years ago when ethergaunts made war upon the planes, using magic they created in cooperation with the nerra to bring whole armies of evil mirror-duplicates from parallel multiverses into our own. Some still seek out the forbidden magic left over from those wars, either to find a way to access other realities or to finally find their way home.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">spell weaver</span><br />
Though allied in the past with the ethergaunts and nerra, spell weavers are not poorly thought of in the present day. Fact is, no one knows <span style="font-style:italic">what</span> to think of them, since their language is incomprehensible and their minds impossible to communicate with psionically. Legend has it that once they had an empire that stretched across the planes, until a ritual performed in Sigil - which some say was once their capital - caused their empire to shatter so completely that it retroactively no longer existed. Only mysterious ruins with no history connected to them remain. In Sigil, they've constructed massive rune-covered obelisks and ziggurats with no visible entrance or exit. They are occasionally seen in the city's markets, looking for magic items. Sometimes they trade with the witchwyrds and denizens of Leng.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">nimblewright</span><br />
Over a thousand years ago, a human civilization became so dependent on its constructs that they became indistinguishable from them. They learned methods of transferring their minds into construct shells and making their construct servants as smart as they were. Then disaster struck - a chaos plague from Limbo infected their cogs and gears, and the magic preventing the glaciers from overwhelming their land faltered. The civilization is gone, now, buried in the ice until the day when the plague is cured and the trapped constructs are mined from their icy prison. Some of the constructs managed to escape to Mechanus, where they found work as laborers, scribes, court bailiffs, and sellswords. From there some of them have migrated to Sigil and Automata in the Outlands. For the most part, they live as ordinary citizens, though they have a certain expertise in the crafting of clockworks that they've gained from centuries of repairing one another. Though they can keep themselves in repair, they no longer have the expertise needed to create more of their kind, and seek out those who might be able to help them make children of their own race, or perhaps even free their ancestors from the black ice that claimed them.</p>

<p>Nimblewrights tend to ally themselves with the Godsmen. A few accursed rebels have joined the Doomguard instead.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">maug</span><br />
Maugs are constructs built for the eternal wars of Acheron. They function best as mercenaries and bodyguards, often competing with nimblewrights for jobs; usually patrons will pick the nine-foot tall, hulking maugs over the slender, almost fragile-looking nimblewrights.  New maugs are always created in Thuldanin, but many find their way to Sigil from time to time. There are maug bars in the City of Doors, places where chemicals corrosive enough to burn stone are imbibed instead of wine or beer. Maugs will work for anyone who has the coin, but are often found supporting the Doomguard or Harmonium. Some have joined the Sensates, driven by stony curiosity to experience things that they couldn't as mere weapons.</p>

<p>Maugs are immortal, and some remember fighting in the wars against the ethergaunts, when they were forced to fight doubles of themselves from some parallel universe in which the ethergaunts had conquered all the planes. Occasionally a maug who fought for the ethergaunts will surface; these creatures were programmed from their creation to be fanatic servitors of the ethergaunt cause, and few ever manage to shake that programming.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">reigar [from Spelljammer]</span><br />
According to myth, the reigar invented arts and craftsmanship and taught it to the first elves, humans, genies, dragons, mercanes, and dwarves. Another myth claims they were the race that deliberately summoned the first illithids from their far realm on the other side of time, unleashing them on reality just because they could. Still another story has it that they destroyed their own world as some kind of demented art project. The most ancient portals and gates are said to be of reigar craftsmanship; some say the reigar created Sigil itself. Reigar are sensual, epicurean people, natural fits for the Sensates but considering themselves far too cultured and sophisticated and jaded for the Society of Sensation to be any use to them. They can be occasionally found in Sigil operating unspeakably decadent clubs or manipulating entire sects and factions for their amusement or to make some esoteric artistic statement. Their ends can end up aiding good or evil, law or chaos; the reigar do not seem to care, or they consider those forces so petty as to be beneath their notice. They care only for art, although their view of art is alien and incomprehensible to most other races.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">urdefhan [from Pathfinder: Bestiary 2]</span><br />
The urdefhans are native to the city of Awaiting Consumption in the Gray Waste of Hades (<span style="font-style:italic">Horsemen of the Apocalypse</span> by Todd Stewart, page 7), where yugoloth lords created them as twisted experiments designed primarily to help keep their other slaves under control. Urdefhans appear in Sigil as emissaries to the yugoloths, arranging trade deals with their native city and acting as servants and bodyguards for greater servants of their masters. They can be found purchasing slaves from Mercykillers, illithids, and denizens of Leng to be carried back with them to the yugoloth 'farms' in their city. They are disliked, but nothing they do is illegal in the Cage. Those that don't work for the yugoloths try to find other masters with similar interests in breeding and consuming slaves and their souls, such as vampires, nightshades, demodands, devourers, rakshasas, divs, kytons, asuras, night hags, and baatezu. They tend to align themselves with the Mercykillers, the Incantifers, and the Fated.</p>

<p>Sigil has a fair-sized population of tieflings who are descendants of refugees from Awaiting Consumption; these tieflings by and large hate the urdefhans with the fury of a thousand lower planar volcanoes, killing them when they can get away with it rather than seeing another slave consigned to the yugoloth breeding-pits.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">illurien [from Monster Manual 5]</span><br />
There is only one Illurien, and she lives in the Outlands. Rumors say that she is a refugee from the realm of Ilsensine, and she preys mainly on mind flayers and eaters of knowledge, trying to find the secrets that Ilsensine stole from her long ago. She isn't averse to taking knowledge from other sources, however. She comes to Sigil only rarely, usually when she's stalking someone in particular or to use the city's portals to cross over to another plane that she cannot easily get to with her innate <span style="font-style:italic">plane shift</span> ability. There are some who say she worships Vecna, but this is more likely an alliance of convenience than any true devotion. </p>

<p>Illurien is allied with no faction, but the sages of the Fraternity of Order are fascinated by her and occasionally bargain with her for knowledge. She can occasionally be convinced to bargain fairly with those who have information that Illurien wants and can't simply take.</p>

<p>What is Illurien? Some say she was a goddess before Ilsensine stole her divinity, or an elemental princess, a rogue noviere eladrin, or something born from Ilsensine's dreams. No one really knows.</p>

<p>The gith races view Illurien with suspicion. They appreciate that she hunts illithids, but she has been known to hunt them as well, searching for traces of Ilsensine's influence in their racial memory. They know better than any races in the multiverse that the enemy of their enemy is not necessarily their friend.</p>

<p>There is an entire order of keepers whose sole purpose in life is to protect Illurien's secrets by any means necessary. Those who bargain with Illurien for knowledge can expect a visit from them, as they seek to destroy anyone who has learned anything from her. They would kill Illurien herself if they could, but she seems to truly be immortal. </p>

<p>There is a rumor that Illurien has mortal descendants: psionic humanoids often mistaken for water genasi who scour the planes - including Sigil - for scraps of lore. Whether they collect knowledge for their own sakes or to sacrifice to their grandmother is anyone's guess.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">denizen of Leng [Bestiary 2]</span><br />
Mysterious traders and slavers of the Far Realm, the denizens of Leng are locked in an eternal war with the Leng spiders. They visit Sigil for the same reasons they visit the City of Brass, the Great Dismal Delve, the City of Awaiting Consumption, Curst, Torch, Zelatar, Gloomwrought, and other dark planar cities - to buy slaves, treasure, and exotic services with their exotic rubies. The denizens of Leng are often enslaved themselves by the moon-beasts (<span style="font-style:italic">Bestiary 3</span>), and seem unable to do anything about it. The denizens of Leng commonly trade with ethergaunts, spell weavers, dao, derro, githyanki, illithids, urdhefans, and dark ones, but will trade with anyone whose coin is good. They are not above kidnapping if they are short on things to sell. Dark creepers are particularly eager to act as servants and go-betweens for the denizens of Leng when such are needed.</p>

<p>While most denizens of Leng are constantly on the move, moving from one city to the next and returning regularly to their homeland of Leng, a few have settled in Sigil for longer periods, operating shops, tents, and kiosks in the Market Ward and the Hive's Night Market where disturbing goods are sold. They move their stores often, rarely spending more than a week in one place, as their prolonged presence tends to upset the locals. They seem to have a mysterious means of magically transporting stone buildings many miles away to another part of the city, effectively instantly.  Besides slaves and rubies, they sometimes offer caged gremlins, cursed monkey's paws, murderous toys, drugs that inspire nightmarish visions, malevolent musical instruments, charms and spells that warp bodies and spirits in unforeseen ways, and trash masked with illusions to appear valuable. </p>

<p>They may have an alliance with the keepers, who will hunt and kill in order to keep the location and even existence of Leng a secret, but seem to leave the denizens of Leng alone. Some theorize the keepers may even be <span style="font-style:italic">from</span> Leng, though they do not say so where the keepers can hear them.</p>

<p>There is a secret that no one knows. Eons ago, the mercanes were enslaved by the Leng spiders who eternally war against the denizens of Leng. Even today, the spiders hold the children and spouses of the mercanes hostage, and force them to help supply and arm them so that they may triumph against their rivals. This is the only reason the mercanes wander the planes, and why their children are never seen.</p>

<p>There is another secret: another race of planar merchants, the witchwyrds (<span style="font-style:italic">Bestiary 2</span>) are in turn slaves of the mercanes, who captured the sandworms whose spice the witchwyrds need to live. The witchwyrds must pay the mercanes for the spice only they can provide, and this money goes to the Leng spiders to fuel their eternal war.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">thendar [from Dragon #101]</span><br />
The thendar are nearly as bored with their long lives as the reigar, though the reigar still consider the thendar to be beneath them. Unlike the reigar, the thendar are generally benevolent in nature. The thendar are enthusiastic members of the Sensates until they decide that seeking out new experiences has become tedious, at which point they might join up with the Godsmen, the Bleakers, the Transcendent Order, the Xaositects, or some other group for the novelty of it. Thendar find employment as sages, tutors, teachers, as guardians with the innate ability to pierce through illusions and disguise, as translators and craftsmen. Very rarely, they may spend a few decades as heroes or paladins before becoming disgusted with the futility of it and going back into seclusion. They often become very wealthy in their long lives, though they are as likely to give all their earnings away in a fit of ennui.</p>

<p>Thendar get along well with celestials, and those seeking an audience with powerful celestials could do worse than to approach a thendar for an introduction. They are also willing to act as guides to the Astral or other planes for those who earn their good will.</p>

<p>Thendar are said to be natives of the Astral Plane, though this is impossible - the Astral is a timeless plane where nothing can be born or mature. Be that as it may, the thendar have lived in the Astral since long before Gith's rebellion, using it as a base to explore the multiverse or a place to retreat and contemplate the void. Their original plane is anyone's guess, though there are hints they may have come from some world on the Material Plane that was destroyed long ago. Who, though, was responsible for this destruction? Titans, primordials, gods, fiends, ethergaunts, the thendar themselves? The thendar refuse to say.</p>

<p>The githyanki despise the thendar, who in turn think of the githyanki as mildly irritating upstarts. Of the Astral races, they get along best with the monastic buommans. It is said that the thendar know secrets of the spell weavers that even the spell weavers have forgotten, but can't be bothered to tell anyone.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><span style="font-weight:bold">alhoon</span><br />
The elder brain is the center of an illithid community: it is their parent, teacher, their leader, and the paradise that awaits them after the deaths of their bodies. Mind flayer liches are cut off from the elder brains that have given them succor all their lives. No longer part of their communities, no longer able to look forward to having their brains join the collective upon their deaths, they wander, using their innate ability to travel the Astral Plane to explore the multiverse. Some come to Sigil, a place where all the planes are only a door away, a place so diverse that even a thing as appalling as a mind flayer lich is not too terrible to be part of a community. </p>

<p>For some alhoon, the hole in their minds where they could once feel the elder brains is an open wound in their souls, one they seek eternally to fill. Their own rotting brains have become irrelevant, and the uncaring multiverse refuses to give up its secrets quickly enough to satisfy an illithid's hunger for communion. They seek alternatives: some become librarians, some join factions (the Sign of One, the Harmonium, and the Fraternity of Order are popular), and some go on sprees where they steal brain after brain, soul after soul, linking undead brains-in-jars and soul gems purchased from shadow demons to psionic circuitry in a desperate attempt to make a mental network large and powerful enough to remind them of home. These engines of psionic and negative energy, buried beneath the city streets or hidden away in stately mansions or institutes of learning, most often destroy their creators as soon as they gain enough power, ending their own wretched existences soon after. Yet sometimes the institute or faction to which the alhoon belonged is too callous and pragmatic to allow the network to die, and these undead mental constructs are enslaved to whatever twisted cause their masters espouse. One, it is said, has become the property of a small group of ethergaunts who seek to use it to help them calculate methods of fragmenting an entire world or plane into scattered demiplanes. Another is the secret focus of a breakaway group of Signers who believe the undead web is the One of their prophesies. One was the focus of a group of Sensates who lost themselves in their tormented song, their minds ripped away to join the others and their bodies turned into pallid zombies who even now act as the network's eyes and hands on Sigil's streets. The last collates data for an elite and amoral group among the Fraternity of Order, organizing all they learn about the laws of the multiverse and keeping damaging secrets about their own fellow faction members for the purpose of blackmail. This last network is especially full of lore learned by the faction from the mysterious Illurien, who would in turn dearly love to find this network and devour its knowledge for herself.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><span style="font-weight:bold">The Dreaming District</span><br />
100 years or so ago, the Believers of the Source imported a large number of xill into the neighborhood around the Great Foundry.</p>

<p>Nowadays, the xill are mostly just Sigilians. They have to get new sentient hosts to incubate their young, of course, and they go through the djinn slaver Qirtaia (<span style="font-style:italic">Enemies &amp; Allies</span>), who gets slaves from a variety of sources including the dao, denizens of Leng, neogi, and tso. The slaves are sold secretly in a hidden market below the city, operated exclusively by xill. </p>

<p>The xill worship their traditional god Sixin (who is also worshiped by nathri, bladelings, and humans who admire Sixin's role as a hunter), but more and more have been turning to the Greek deity Asclepius, who offers healing that Sixin does not, and whose role as a god of resurrection strikes a chord with the xill, who have begun to believe that xill souls are reincarnations of the victims who incubated them. The Vedic pantheon is also increasingly popular. </p>

<p>The leaders of the xill community include a half-slaad and a half-chasme. </p>

<p>Although they are enemies of the xill on their home plane (more pests, really, than rivals), the nathri have filtered into the xill neighborhood over the decades, and are now as much a part of it as anyone else. They run a haberdashery, work at the Great Foundry, and helped found the Dreamthieves Guild. They are rivals of the goblins.</p>

<p>Since the Tempest of Doors, a portal that once led to the Ethereal Plane now leads to Dal Quor. The <span style="font-weight:bold">quori</span> have begun filtering into Sigil, delighted at a path out of their long exile. </p>

<p>The rest of the population is mainly human, tiefling, and genasi, but more and more are willingly being transformed into Inspired by the quori.</p>

<p>The Dreamthieves Guild, founded by nathri and some other psionic dream-travelers, is a small organization (disguised as an exclusive adventurer's club) dedicated to stealing thoughts and memories from the minds of dreamers for the benefit of select clients. </p>

<p>Cluracan and Nuala, ambassadors from Faerie. They had been the Faerie ambassadors to the Plane of Dreams until recently, but there had been some sort of coup: the Dream King killed, and both ambassadors sent fleeing through the gates between worlds. Rumors whispered of something called the Dreaming Dark and a race called the quori. Now they are ambassadors to the City of Doors, arrogant and aloof. Tiny winged fey hold up Nuala's dress so that its hems would not touch the filthy streets. A burly, tusked ogre clears the way in front of them. "Make way for the ambassadors from Faerie!" he bellows. Cluracan and Nuala refuse to speak of what scared them enough to leave their posts in the Plane of Dreams, but since abandoning their duties, they dare not return home to Faerie and their mercurial queen Titania. So they are exiles in Sigil for now, still posing as the regal ambassadors they no longer have the right to claim to be.</p>

<p>The quori do not yet know the City of Doors; their exile to the plane of Dal Quor sealed off all Sigilian portals long ago. Now that they have rediscovered access through the Plane of Dreams, however, they are making up for lost time. The most common quori in Sigil are the servile tsucora, who bow and scrape and perform tasks for the more magisterial kalaraq, who present themselves to the Cagers as visiting lords and sages, dispensing wealth raided from the coffers of the slain Dream King to purchase the knowledge and contacts they need of this strange new multiverse they find themselves in and offering fabulous secrets and opportunities for those who will volunteer to become their Inspired. They offer all to make everyone's dreams come true. Secretly, the dream masters invade the minds of Sigil's sleepers, planting seeds for an eventual attempt by the quori to take over. Perhaps they will start with a single faction, most likely the Sign of One, and grow their dominance of the Cage from there, if rival groups like night hags, moon-beasts, the Dreamthieves Guild, and kalashtar don't upset their plans before they can grow to fruition. The moon-beasts, in particular, consider themselves to be the rightful rulers of Dream, and are using their denizen of Leng slaves to frustrate quori schemes.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

          Reth Dekala        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>I thought the reth dekala were the most interesting part of <span style="font-style:italic">Tome of Battle</span>. Being from Acheron and made of smoke and iron and flame, they reminded me of Vorkehan, the Mercykiller city.</p>

<p>My idea is that before the Great Upheaval, the Sodkillers were a faction whose core belief (perhaps inspired by the kolyaruts) is the importance of contracts. They also had a job - mercenary work - just as the Godsmen make tools and the Takers collect taxes, but that's not their philosophy. The Sodkillers, then, believed that the multiverse itself was a client and it was important that both sides fulfilled their contract, just as it was important for mercenaries to fulfill the contracts their clients gave them. Just as a mercenary must be paid, so must all of us if we do what we agreed to do. The dissent might be along the lines of: what exactly have we agreed to? When did we agree? Is our payment a lifetime, or is it the afterlife, or both? Is the afterlife a different job than life, or is it what we get in exchange for living? Is there a true afterlife, or is our wage blessed oblivion as the Dustmen claim? If death is our reward for success, what is our punishment for failure, especially if you believe that Acheron is the primary exemplar of your philosophy (preventing the Upper Planes from being seen as a reward)?</p>

<p>It's not hard to see how such a faction might find common ground with the Sons of Mercy, resulting in a faction that believes in justice first and foremost - the proper reward for fulfilling a contract, and the penalty for failure, is obviously part of that, but the Sons of Mercy bring in the new idea that there are also laws you haven't agreed to that are equally important, as well as the possibility that the less severe punishment might be given when laws are broken - a strange concept known as mercy.</p>

<p>This, by the way, is not necessarily the philosophy of the modern Sodkillers, who are really just the stern no-mercy fraction of the Mercykillers and not a true rebirth of the ancient Sodkiller faction. Though they're mercenaries again instead of running the Prison, they still believe in justice first and foremost; contracts are only one aspect of their philosophy, the one they're able to concentrate on the most in the new, less lawful post-Faction War Sigil.</p>

<p>Anyway, the story behind the reth dekala is that they were human mercenaries who entered into a contract with a baatezu noble whose stronghold was in Acheron (an exile?). When the baatezu started demanding they kill their own families, they refused, and so were cursed to exist in constant flame and agony. Though the baatezu is now long dead, they must hunt down and destroy their now-scattered descendants if they are ever to be free.</p>

<p>Okay, so how are the Sodkillers connected?</p>

<p>- Perhaps the reth dekala were Sodkillers, originally, and the Sodkillers of Vorkehan are those mercenaries who didn't turn against their patron. Perhaps Vorkehan was created by the baatezu noble, then - even its stronghold. The Sodkillers/Mercykillers might consider the reth dekala to be foul lawbreakers who deserve any agony they might inflict, while the reth dekala might revere the Sodkillers for having the strength and foresight to do what they could not, resulting in a weird sado-masochistic "Please punish me/I must punish you" relationship.</p>

<p>- The reth dekala might have approached the Sodkillers for help in fulfilling their contracts, and helped to build their city in exchange for helping to hunt down their descendants. When the Sodkiller faction stopped existing, they were technically free of this requirement, but now that they're back the reth dekala are insisting they continue their ancient task.</p>

<p>- Those reth dekala who decide to endure the pain rather than killing their descendants might be hunted down by enraged Sodkiller/Mercykillers, as well as kolyarut inevitables.</p>

<p>Perhaps the archdevil who created the reth dekala was known as Dekala, and <span style="font-style:italic">reth</span> is Infernal for "slaves of." It barely matters at this point, but let's say that Dekala was an exiled general of Moloch's court, and she resembled a pit fiend with green smoke and flame flowing out of her eyes and mouth, or like a fiendish version of the reth dekala themselves with smoke and flame replacing her legs. Perhaps some weapons crafted from her bones still exist, wielded by the most powerful of the reth dekala. Perhaps a sword made from Dekala's bones is the most effective weapon against them, and one of their descendants wields it against her otherworldly ancestors.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

          Infernals        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>The origin of the mysterious <span style="font-weight:bold">infernals</span> (Iron Kingdoms <span style="font-style:italic">Monsternomicon</span> volumes I and II) is much disputed in Sigil. Obscure myths, considered blasphemous by the baatezu, claim that eons ago, before Asmodeus descended to the ruby throne of Nessus, another dark lord ruled. A civil war erupted, with Baalzebul, Armaros, and Gargauth taking the side of Asmodeus in the struggle, and the former lord was exiled. </p>

<p>In exile on another plane, the former lord of the Ninth formed a new court, which he called Infernus. One tome claims Infernus was founded in the blackest furnace of Gehenna, while another claims a cube of Acheron was reshaped to resemble the palace of Malsheem. Still another claims that Infernus was severed from the known planes and exists as a demiplane, connected to the Outlands and Baator by obscure portals. </p>

<p>Another tome, <span style="font-style:italic">The Resolution of All Enchantments</span>, surviving only in a single copy being peddled by unscrupulous witchwyrds in the Night Market, claims that the exiled noble Armaros, who has been forbidden to recruit followers by Asmodeus's direct order, has secretly founded the order of infernals himself, creating the "previous lord of Hell" rumor himself as a distraction. If this were true it would be justification enough for Armaros to be instantly destroyed by the Lord of the Ninth, but it would also be a sign that Armaros may be already too powerful to destroy.</p>

<p>In truth, no one knows for sure from which dark plane the infernals hail. The baatezu work to silence any who even mention them, and the powers of good are just as active in trying to prevent curious diabolists from learning of the infernals and the bargains they make. </p>

<p>The infernals are, in any case, certainly rare in Sigil, appearing only when called through the underground occult channels (some of them operated by yugoloths who enjoy sowing conflict between other races of fiends) and avoiding the baatezu whenever possible. </p>

<p>From the few sources available, it seems that the lowest castes of infernal are the "conscriptus" soldier castes, who answer to the curators, those who bargain for individual souls. The curators do not share these souls with other races; they do not trade them in open markets, like the night hags and shadow demons, but bring them back to their mysterious domain to increase the power of their race.  Above the curators are the mighty executors, who bargain not with individuals but dozens or hundreds of individuals at once, bending the fabric of reality itself in fulfillment of their dread bargains. There are those who believe an executor infernal, rather than an archdevil, was responsible for the creation of the reth dekala of Acheron. Above the executors are said to be the mysterious architects and magnates, who may be godlike in power, but it's impossible to determine the names or numbers of these figures. Perhaps the magnates are all a single individual who goes by many names.</p>

<p>The greatest weakness of the infernals is their need for secrecy regarding their origins and activities. They cannot join factions or maintain permanent known addresses in Sigil without tipping their hand. The yugoloths, the tanar'ri, and even the demodands seek to unmask them and force their secret conflict with the baatezu into the open. It's believed by some chant-mongers that the efreet know more about the infernals than they're letting on, and that they're openly considering an alliance with that mysterious race. The fiendish asuras and kytons, too, may be interested in anyone who challenges the iron grip the baatezu have over their plane.</p>

<p>If there are infernals living in Sigil, they disguise themselves as orders of monks or nuns, only exposing their true nature when their mortal agents confirm that a client is safe.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I'm not sure if Zodar really work as NPCs. Since everything can be found in Sigil, there's no doubt that there's at least one Zodar who has settled there, and maybe a handful of others are mysteriously tagging along with adventuring parties, but I doubt they make for a solid commune within Sigil. They don't seem to like crowds, or even each other. A conversation with one would be a little tedious, and possibly a tad scary, since they are after all unpredictable, indestructable deathmachines from space <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/smile.png" title="Smiling" alt="Smiling" class="smiley-content"/></p>

<p>And while we're on the subject of the Iron Kingdoms, here's some minor seeds that don't enter into faction politics:</p>

<p>A powerful merchant is phasing out his usualy bodyguard of normal pig-faced orcs and replacing them with the savage-and-hence-much-cheaper boar-headed <span style="font-weight:bold">Farrow</span>. The disgruntled orc-union has decided that a staged assassination might make him reconsidder. Too bad they forgot to tell their hitman about the 'staged' part...</p>

<p>A slightly mad <span style="font-weight:bold">Gatorman</span> shaman gets carried around Sigil by his tribe on an improvised gurney. He's deadly ill, but the spirits have given him a mission. Too bad none of his tribesmen can really tell the difference between prophecy and insane fever dream, but he sure keeps mentioning the demodands a lot.</p>

<p>A rogue modron has recently set up shop in town, but never leaves it and meets with the more enigmatic of Sigil's powermongers. Petty thieves that have staked out his place report strange <span style="font-weight:bold">Animatons</span>, either pets imported from Mechanus, or the modron's clever creation. Some whisper that they're frankensteinian combination. When asked, his fellow modrons clam up and when checked upon a short while later they show signs of crying.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Reth Dekala - Sodkillers and the Dreaming District are both brilliant ideas. They could have a slake moth slave they milk for the dream drug - Dragon #353.</p>

<p>Infernals - I thought about combining them with the infernal from Epic Level Handbook - to be their most powerful form, possibly on a Godsmen path - Armaros is one of the most interesting baatezu, best explanation for them.</p>

<p>Zodar - I imagine several of them would be interested in the city, they seem to like weird, anomalous places, and cages.</p>

<p><img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/smile.png" title="Smiling" alt="Smiling" class="smiley-content"/> The orc union hires Farrow's tiefling assassin persona, there would be some confusion with the name. </p>

<p>continuing ...</p>

<p>quesar - Warriors of Heaven – one visits the Hands of Time - looking for a way to make more of its race</p>

<p>firbolg - MM2 - hunters and traders from Tir Na Og</p>

<p>zern - MM4 - like the Weary Spirit Infirmary in the Hive or a daelkyr - their philosophy possibly Signers</p>

<p>jermalaine - MM2 - perfect as scavengers and criminals in the Hive</p>

<p>immoth - MM2 - could be that one of the daughters of Baba Yaga cursed them - would they trade their shards of frozen information? </p>

<p>visilight-parai - MM3 - what if they tried to assimilate the dabus? or hunt axiomites to get the perfect form - could be in the Beatification League I posted above</p>

<p>marrashi - mm2 - serve genies and wizards - cause mass deaths of the in the Hive, cull the weak</p>

<p>vaati wendeam - Rod of Seven Parts - would be easier to track the Rod if they have a base of operation in Sigil - Guvners?</p>

<p>ruvkova - PSMC3 - alchemist Primals</p>

<p>caulborn - City of Strangers - oracles, perfect for Sensates</p>

<p>azi sruvara - PF: The Final Wish - their poison affects undead and fiends, would be highly valuable - one could live in the Ditch</p>

<p>nihiloi - PF: Mother of Flies - they actively seek to close or destroy portals to Shadow</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

          Caulborn        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>The caulborn (<span style="font-style:italic">Bestiary 3</span>) wander the multiverse, hunting for new facts and concepts. They care little for wealth unless it helps get them access to libraries and other interesting places and relying on their innate <span style="font-style:italic">charm</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">detect thoughts</span> abilities to teach them what they need to know. Because they have no need to eat or drink, and little need for shelter, most have no need to work, unless the local authorities crack down on homeless populations in an area where they want to be. In some cases they end up working alongside mongrelfolk, goblinoids, and other unskilled laborers, learning from their thoughts and earning just enough money to purchase knowledge. Since they have no interest in other races, they seldom join factions and they never hire themselves out as teachers or sages unless they are greatly in need of money. If it becomes necessary, in their judgment, to settle into more expensive parts of town and socialize with the upper crust in order to learn what they desire, they'll do that, charging high rates for secrets, lore, and prophecies only they know, being as accurate as they need to be in order to draw clients, but concentrating more on telling their clients what they want to hear; their goal is money, not educating others. </p>

<p>It's not that that the caulborn have any ethical difficulty with giving knowledge to others; it's simply that they don't care either way. Their focus is entirely on their own race and family groups. If teaching others can help them gain new information, they'll do that, but if it doesn't help them they'd prefer to keep to themselves. If joining a faction (they sympathize with the goals of the Sensates and Fraternity of Order) can give them access to information they couldn't otherwise access, they'll join the faction, but they'll leave it and move on the moment the faction is no longer useful to them.</p>

<p>Among some, the caulborn are hated for their disturbing appearance and predatory ways. If they can get away with it, they'll damage a victim's brain while consuming its thoughts. Those who are unable to protect themselves may find themselves their victims - places where the caulborn have been often become littered with dazed and confused homeless people, prostitutes, and others who fall beneath the interest of the law. Caulborn run afoul of the mysterious keepers, who will do anything to prevent certain secrets from being revealed. The liquid princess Illurien of the Outlands has been known to prey upon the caulborn, making their knowledge hers. For the most part, the caulborn treat everyone equally, from the foulest and lowliest dretch to the most exalted tome archon. They know they can learn something from everyone. </p>

<p>They have the innate ability to <span style="font-style:italic">plane shift</span> once a week, but Sigil's portals are often more convenient, both to get them to new places and to allow them to sit down and wait for exotic peoples and cultures from across the multiverse to come to them. Small colonies of caulborn (they commonly wander either alone, in pairs, or in colonies of three to twelve) can be found in every part of the City of Doors, from the miserable depths of the Hive to the academies of the Clerk's Ward to the elegant mansions of The Lady's Ward, working as manual laborers, clerks, doctors, high-priced sages, gurus, fortune-tellers, grifters, con artists, and nothing at all. After spending years in one place, they'll move on to a different part of the city or another plane, where they can be found everywhere from the City of Awaiting Consumption to the City of Brass to the Library of the Imenteshes to the Carnival of Flesh and Spirit to the White Well of the Norns to the Marketplace Eternal to the Casino of the Gods, to the Academy of the Scalpel in Hell, to shining Yetsirah in the Seven Heavens.</p>

<p>The caulborn have given any number of answers to those who have asked them their origin. Some have claimed to be descended from eaters of knowledge from Ilsensine's Caverns of Thought who saw the errors of their ways and now work for the good of all. Some claim to be refugees from a world destroyed by whoever the person they're speaking to hates the most for no crime but innocent curiosity. Often they'll describe themselves as penitent hermits seeking enlightenment, or they'll pretend to be nothing more than outcast laborers looking for work. </p>

<p>One of the most common theories, however, connects them to the strange living world of Palpatur (from <span style="font-style:italic">Beyond Countless Doorways</span>). When that planet was devastated by the Blood War, it fell into something like a coma, senseless and in agony. Yet some of the <span style="font-style:italic">bioleche</span>, organic tools the world created for the benefit of its inhabitants, was sent throughout the planes, developing sentience of its own and becoming the caulborn, determined to learn enough to reawaken their suffering world. </p>

<p>A darker theory has it that the caulborn are the result of neh-thalggu using their reproductive spore to transform humanoids - or, perhaps, the insensate flesh of Palpatur - into creatures that would one day learn enough to nourish the larval neh-thalggu within the irregular lumps of a caulborn's body. When a caulborn learns enough, this theory goes, the creature bursts apart and three to twelve juvenile neh-thalggu fly out, ready to explore the cosmos.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Mysterious humanoids that seem to be forged from the stuff of the spheres, many sages and theologians believe the zodars to be a sort of immune system of the cosmos. According to this theory, they were created at the same time as the crystal spheres to steer destiny at pivotal points in history, but only in events that threaten the stability of the spheres themselves. Even the destruction of a single world is rarely a large enough event to concern them, unless this destruction affects other worlds as well. </p>

<p>As an axis point in the multiverse, Sigil is blessed or cursed with at least three different zodars. Like all zodars, they never speak (or, rather, they are permitted to speak only three times during their lifetimes, so no one alive today has heard them speak).</p>

<p>1. <span style="font-style:italic">Brashith</span> was tasked at the dawn of creation with preventing the casting of the Sigil Spell, a magic created twenty thousand years ago by an ancient wizard who nearly used it to overthrow the Lady of Pain. For the last five hundred years, Brashith has stood still as a statue in the Gatehouse, watching over the madman Gifad, the Oldest Barmy. PCs who play through the events of <span style="font-style:italic">Faction War</span> will have to battle Brashith before the climax of the adventure.</p>

<p>2. <span style="font-style:italic">Berith</span> was tasked (again, the same time the spheres were created) with preventing Vecna from tampering with the structure of the multiverse with the Language Primeval in Sigil (in the adventure <span style="font-style:italic">Die Vecna Die!</span>). It has spent centuries inside the Armory, awaiting the day when Vecna will transform it into his fortress. Unfortunately, neither its three spells nor its <span style="font-style:italic">wish</span> were enough to defeat the lich in the end; Vecna destroyed it after a brief duel, showing the people of Sigil how dire their straits really were.</p>

<p>3. A zodar known simply as the <span style="font-style:italic">Anti-Zodar</span> looks radically different from others of its kind. Its armor-like exoskeleton, which is black as the night sky for other zodars, is instead a brilliant silver, gold, and blue, the colors swirling as if the air around it were distorted by incredible heat; however, it is cool to the touch. It was originally tasked with preventing the incursion of the Far Realm into its sphere of origin, but instead the energies of the Far Realm transformed it utterly. It now hunts down others of its kind to destroy them and consume their essence, growing in power with each zodar it slays. At the same time, without its appointed guardians, the fate of the multiverse grows more uncertain. While other zodars exist to defend the status quo of the multiverse and its crystal spheres, the Anti-Zodar works toward the destruction of everything. The Anti-Zodar is a legend to the Doomguard, some of whom believe it to be a servant of their gods or a nascent god in its own right. Currently the Anti-Zodar roams the City of Doors, searching out uncorrupted members of its kind to slay.</p>

<p>Other zodars can be found occasionally in Sigil, following around adventuring parties on some momentous mission or standing in front of a portal, waiting motionless and patient, sometimes for years, until it shifts to the correct destination. Since the arrival of the Anti-Zodar, however, they have become less common, forced to expend the powers granted to them long ago to defend themselves rather than to fulfill their destinies. Zodars who have used up their magic in order to escape the Anti-Zodar may approach powerful adventurers and speak the few words allotted to them in order to beg for their assistance in completing the tasks they can no longer complete on their own.</p>

          Re: Monstrous races living in Sigil        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Eons ago, vast leathery-winged demigods emerged from a dying multiverse to feed on the essence of the known planes. They located a <span style="font-style:italic">nefesh</span>, a planar conduit that channeled the stuff of raw potential from the Inner Planes to the Outer Planes, and latched on to it like leeches, their ancient, dessicated bodies voraciously absorbing the power long denied them in their used-up planes of origin.</p>

<p>Sensing the danger this posed to the stability of reality, the ancient serpent gods Jazirian and Shekinester uncoiled from their lairs and slithered down the <span style="font-style:italic">nefesh</span> conduit to confront the invaders. The ensuing battle did not end easily: the demigods were newly empowered with the wellspring of possibility and frantic to ensure their new food source was not taken from them. After years of divine conflict that rent the fabric of the planes apart, the serpent gods finally dispatched the last of the planar vampires and repaired the breach in the planes as best they could. In doing so, they inadvertantly created a bubble plane, an anomaly in space and time manifesting as a hollow sphere about 100 miles across. This bubble, which planar explorers would later name the Violet, became a realm where the laws of magic and time were broken and strange, but somehow life was able to flourish within. Before the hungry invaders died, the planar energy within them galvanized their long-dry wombs and spawned a new mortal race, the ancestors of the cloakers. A colony of couatls also came to dwell on the plane, either deliberately left behind by Jazirian as guardians or accidentally manifested from that ancient god's spilled blood. Among other lesser abberations that came to dwell in the Violet, another planar race sprung into being in the wake of the godswar: the dimensional warpers, a serpentine, sail-winged people with vaguely humanoid aspect and an innate power to bend space and time. The dimensional warpers managed to escape the Violet very early, driven out by the eternal conflict between cloakers and couatls, and they wander the planes now, trading and making bargains with powerful planar entities in the hope of purchasing or creating a new realm of their own.</p>

<p>Much later, an ancient cabal of wizards (perhaps ethergaunts, drow, or some other prehuman race) managed to open a gate from the Material Plane to the Violet, accidentally manifesting it in the heart of a cloaker swarm. The wizards managed to shunt the cloakers into the Plane of Shadow rather than allow them to invade their own realm directly, but that only delayed their eventual exodus.</p>

<p>After centuries on the Plane of Shadow, the cloakers became changed creatures, able to manipulate shadowstuff naturally. They may have made some kind of pact with Erebus, a primordial deity from before the dawn of creation, to enhance their racial powers and enable them to more easily survive in their new home. When they finally found their way to the Prime, they found that prolonged exposure to sunlight and even moonlight were lethal to them, so they remained confined to the depths below.</p>

<p>In Sigil, cloakers are primarily Sensates, Athar, Xaositects, Bleakers, and Ciphers. They live among other beings, working as artists, musicians, sculptors of shadowstuff and torturers and executioners among the criminal elements of society. They get along with derro and Dark Ones, but they have difficulty accepting that races other than their own have rights or dignity, or understanding why non-cloakers cannot be tortured and killed if a cloaker finds it convenient. Cloakers also do not understand the concept of worship; they know the Powers exist, but do not know why anyone would do more than fear, avoid, or occasionally bargain with one in cases of mutual self-interest.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dimensional warpers</span>: These strange beings sprang from the mingled blood of Jazirian and the alien adversaries who had sought to drain the multiverse of its potential. A shy race, dimensional warpers prefer to find hidden places in the midst of densely populated areas where they can observe others without themselves being observed. They are curious, obsessed with gaining knowledge to the point that they will pick fights solely to learn more about others, though they will flee rather than fight to the death. Their society is ruled by sages and masters, who are identifiable by a ring of tattoos around their snakey heads. They have been known to join the Sensates, the Fraternity of Order, and the Transcendent Order. Currently, some of them are negotiating with Graz'zt in the hope of purchasing a new homeland for their wandering people. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Notes</span>: Ideas for this came from "The Ecology of the Cloaker"  in Kobold Quarterly #4. The Violet is from <span style="font-style:italic">Beyond Countless Doorways</span> by Malhavoc Press. <span style="font-style:italic">Nefesh</span> is a Hebrew word for soul, but is used as a kind of planar conduit in <span style="font-style:italic">Dark Roads &amp; Golden Hells</span> from Open Design. </p>

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>That sounds good to me. Most efreet are planewalkers to some extent, but I'm glad you found one your players are familiar with.</p>

<p>And yes, the Anti-Zodar is inspired by the Anti-Monitor.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Mothmen</span><br />
Drawn to disasters across the planes like moths to a flame, mothmen are enigmatic agents of fate.</p>

<p>Somewhere in the multiverse is the Loom of Fate (<span style="font-style:italic">Dark Roads &amp; Golden Hells</span>, pages 19-21), where the multifold gods of predestination - Istus, Shekinester, Rava, the Norns, the Moirai - weave threads of destiny into mortal lives. But mortals aren't the only slaves of Fate. In the roots of Yggdrasil, in the depths of the Astral Plane, titanic silkworms grown bloated on the flesh of dead gods of chance spin the silk from which destiny is woven, harvested by ruthless spiders of time.</p>

<p>There is another set of beings who occasionally intervene and break this cycle - the aeons (Pathfinder <span style="font-style:italic">Bestiary 2</span>), particularly the thelatos, who believe that some destinies must be protected and others must be defied. Other aeons occasionally intervene as well: the akhana, who cut Clotho's threads of birth and repair the damage done by Atropos's scissors; the bythos, who guard the Loom of Fate from non-aeons who might molest it; even the pleromas, who protect and alter the destinies of entire worlds. Often, they intervene through agents, planar silkworms that they liberate from Fate's yoke and shape into humanoid form. These creatures, descended from the worms of destiny but metamorphosed through the aeons' magic, are the mothmen.</p>

<p>The mothmen are not creatures of order. Their connection to fate is instinctual, and the aeons set them free to follow their instincts wherever they might lead. Some, sages believe, have gone mad thanks to the aeons' warping of their bodies and minds and pursue irrational, destructive destinies with the intensity of fanatics. They fly toward times of great crisis and opportunity - natural disasters, wars, planar rifts - and guide Fate not toward where the gods planned, but toward where they believe it would have gone had the gods not interfered. In their deep racial memory they believe they can recall a time before there were gods of fate, when the silkworms determined the course of history on their own. The aeons believe that this animal instinct more closely matches the will of the Monad that guides them than the whims of the great powers or lumbering, archaic constructs like the zodars. The gods themselves have difficulty acting or even locating these pests, as their bodies feel identical to the threads of destiny to divine senses. They require mortal agents to find them and oppose these creatures who seek to thwart their will.</p>

<p>In Sigil they work as they work elsewhere in the planes, searching for disasters and calamities and changing the course of events in their alien, inscrutable ways. If they join a faction it is usually on a temporary basis only, until the current crisis is settled one way or another, before moving on to another event on another plane. The Xaositects, Transcendent Order, Fated, Athar, and Doomguard all appreciate them and seek to use them to their own ends. They may come into conflict with the zodars, who were created (perhaps by the gods) long ago and serve an ossified, ancient view of destiny that differs from the living, instinctual vision of the mothmen. Although created as agents of the aeons, the mothmen serve no will but their own. </p>

<p>Mothmen have another use for disasters: they take the opportunity to lay eggs in the fabric of the universe, where their grubs feed on the energy of time, chance, and fate to grow into silkworms. The silkworms then crawl through the planes back to the god-corpses drifting among Yggdrasil's roots to begin the cycle again.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>cromlich</em> wrote:</div>The mothmen are my favorite of the Mystery Monsters, the silkworms and their unique view of Fate make them even more interesting. I like the way the spiders from Mystara are included. Also the weavers from Bas-Lag could be among them. </div></p>

<p>I was definitely thinking of the weavers. Apart from them, the spiders could be planar spiders (from Mystara and the old 1st edition module <span style="font-style:italic">Needle</span>) or jumpers (immortal-level time monsters from the <span style="font-style:italic">Immortals Set</span>, also connected to Mystara).</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Do you have any connections between the aeons and archons?</div></p>

<p>In Gnostic Christianity, aeons are the true angels who bring knowledge of the Divine to mortals imprisoned by the false reality of the Demiurge and his archons. I thought of using the word "aeon" to describe an earlier race of celestials who lived in Mount Celestia long ago before ascending beyond the seventh heaven, appointing the archons to guard the heavens in their place. That doesn't work with the true neutral Pathfinder aeons, though. I suppose Pathfinder aeons might still be a more ancient race that the archons rose to oppose, but in that case the archons are definitely more the 'good guys' than the aeons are. </p>

<p>I had the idea that the original Hebdomad, the seven tome archons who watch over the seven heavens, were the seven Wandering Dukes who created the <span style="font-style:italic">Rod of Seven Parts</span>, transformed into beings of lawful good after martyring themselves to defeat the hordes of Chaos at the Battle of Pesh. That doesn't quite work with the <span style="font-style:italic">Rod of Seven Parts</span> boxed set, though, which has one of the original seven still very much alive and still one of the vaati (and not good in alignment), but perhaps they could still be created from the spirits of seven martyred Wind Dukes who died at Pesh; just not those particular seven.</p>

<p>As for connections with the aeons:</p>

<p>1. The aeons created the archons in order to oppose the evil of the fiends? Unlikely, since I'd still rather credit the powers of good. A fan named Dave King/Heregul coined the name <span style="font-style:italic">priminals</span> to represent the opposite numbers of the baernaloths. I'd note that there are obvious parallels between the archon castes and the guardinal castes (hound = lupinal, sword = leonal, owl = avoral, warden = ursinal) that suggests the Hebdomad or some other group might have created the first archons from transformed guardinals. </p>

<p>2. The archons were created to oppose the aeons! Maybe the aeons were meddling with the petitioners of Mount Celestia, attempting to turn them into footsoldiers of the Monad, and the archons were created to defend the plane. This is a weak idea, though, since it's weird that Mount Celestia would ever have been unguarded, and it's weird that the aeons would target the plane of lawful good specifically rather than any of the other planes. They need a specific reason to be at odds.</p>

<p>3. The aeons were taking advantage of the chaos across the planes after the Battle of Pesh to try to rewrite all of reality in their favor, and the newly created archons happened to be the ones who stopped them. Somewhere in Jovar is a book created by the aeons, and warden archons watch over it, knowing if the aeons are ever able to read aloud from it all of the planes may shift.</p>

<p>4. Maybe one of the tome archons is a former aeon who "fell from grace" and became lawful good. I'd point to Pistis Sophia, who is named after a Gnostic aeon. Replacing an earlier tome archon who died defending the <span style="font-style:italic">Book of Aeons</span>, she has renounced the Monad and now serves law and goodness. She still knows secrets only the aeons know.</p>

<p>I'm tempted to make the Loom of Fate the home plane of the aeons, since that would help distinguish them from the rilmani of the Outlands.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>In Alphatia they had swarms of silk-spiders - I think from another world - they could  work on these ''farms'' of dweomersilk.</p>

<p>I'd also prefer that the powers of good created the archons. What if the aeons at the beginning were lawful good. In Gnosticism, starting with Plato, such beings were benevolent, with good intentions. Centuries later the gnostics have attributed them more flaws. So Aeons could be spirits of the ages - like zeitgeist - that changed as the belief in them changed. Archons and Pisis Sophia managed to stay on their ''path of perfection''. Maybe Abraxas was involved, I think he should be something other than a demon prince.</p>

<p>I've seen on Paizo forums that they prefer the psychopomps - probably there won't more information about them.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>cromlich</em> wrote:</div>Maybe Abraxas was involved, I think he should be something other than a demon prince.</div></p>

<p>I wrote some stuff about Abraxas a while ago.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Abraxas</span></p>

<p>Called the Supreme Unknown and the Unfathomable, Abraxas is a chimerical mix of serpent and man, a shifting creature like a yuan-ti sitting on a throne made of living cockatrices and basilisks; his crown is likewise scaled, feathered, and alive, and both throne and crown merge with his body. He rules the layer known as Pleroma or Death's Reward, an abyss of pure light that slowly devours the souls of those that mistake it for Chronia, the Seventh Heaven (and anyone else who remains there for too long). Abraxas is a demon prince who is powerfully connected with evil magic and profane secrets. </p>

<p>Abraxas has few allies in the Abyss; he still considers himself to be above them, though he has long since given up on any semblance of benevolence or order, qualities he believes are lies created as part of the celestial machinery of control. His most prized servants are sorcerers with some of the training of monks, and these magi create amulets enscribed with mystical words and numbers designed to allow even the least scholarly a chance to witness his false Heaven when they die.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Relationships</span></p>

<p>Like the demon lords Unsere, Tarish'qual, and Amenenagon, Abraxas was originally a servant of the primal lord Sch'theraqpasstt, and cast from his domain after their master's strange apotheosis.</p>

<p>Abraxas's chief rival in the Abyss is Unsere, who has been his rival since they both served Sch'theraqpasstt. They both claim some dominion over magic; Unsere over raw magical might, and Abraxas over amulets, scrolls, and magical items, and as a result they compete over the same followers. Both seek to undermine the other at every opportunity. </p>

<p>Sch'theraqpasstt, even in his diminished state, feels spite and rage toward both Unsere and Abraxas for "abandoning" him when his layer became a realm of utter chaos, and for continuing to draw power from the Mind of Evil. While Sch'theraqpasstt is no longer powerful enough to dominate Abraxas or Unsere physically, his remaining yuan-ti followers go out of their way to expose Abraxas's cults for what they are. Abraxas, for his part, counsels his followers to avoid yuan-ti and does not seek to proselytize around them. The serpent-folk prefer their patrons to make more open promises of power than Abraxas does, in any case.</p>

<p>Abraxas has an ally of sorts with Xaxivort, a minor lord who was Graz'zt's master of slaves after the defection of his predecessor Raxivort. Abraxas and Xaxivort have virtually nothing in common except that Pholtus and his followers wish very badly to destroy them both, and as a result they have occasionally made common cause against He of the Blinding Light. Even so, Abraxas did nothing when Xaxivort was imprisoned by Pholtus's priests, as ultimately Abraxas desires only success for the faith that he successfully acts as a parasite on, and occasionally Xaxivort goes too far to damage Pholtus' reputation.</p>

<p>Abraxas' special foe is the celestial hierarch Pistis Sophia, with whom he has a longstanding feud on the Material Plane. Their mortal followers are their primary pawns in this silent war, the souls of all mortals their stake. </p>

<p>One legend claims that Abraxas is in part Pistis Sophia's responsibility. When he was first cast from the Sch'theraqpasstt's realm he was sorely wounded by the chaotic waves and thrown into the Outlands, where he lay dying and broken. In her boundless compassion, Pistis Sophia adopted him, attempting to steer him toward Law and Good, training him in the stern austerities that typify her creed. For a time it seemed to take, and she became Pistis Sophia's pride and joy, her proof that her techniques could redeem even the most wretched evil. Abraxas became known as the Basilisk Angel, known as much for his deadliness in combat as his fanatic devotion to the goal of ascending to the Seventh Heaven. His studies came to a limit, though, the same limitations as his mentor - he was <span style="font-style:italic">too</span> stern, too uncompromising. Desperate to prove himself, he began exploring arcane magic as a shortcut, and in this deviation from the path of Law, the Abyss found its channel back to his heart. His appearance began to grow more bestial and debased, but Pistis Sophia scarcely noticed, immersed as she was in her own meditations. At last Abraxas' ritual was complete, and he emerged in what he thought was Chronia. It was not.</p>

<p>Abraxas slowly realized that the void of endless light in which he arrived was not part of Mount Celestia, but only a facade created by the mocking Abyss. Rather than admit failure, he decided that Chronia had always been part of the Abyss - that the Celestial Mount was based on a lie, and all archons were complicit. Archons, he reasoned, must be using the false promise of the Illuminated Heaven to maintain control over those who trusted them. The disenchanted creature decided to teach others what he had learned, so that they too would find the shortcut to the false heaven and become enlighted. Archon tyranny would be exposed.</p>

<p>Another legend claims that during an age when Abraxas was already reigning from his throne of serpents in the Abyss, Pistis Sophia entered his realm of her own accord, searching for knowledge that only a demon lord knows. Somehow she learned a way to take Abraxas's profane secrets and make them safe for the forces of Good. </p>

<p>Still another myth, retold among the scholars of Boccob, has it that neither archon nor demon initiated their meeting, but that it was secretly facilitated by Boccob himself. What Pistis Sophia would have accomplished if she had not become consumed with her eternal battle against Abraxas cannot now be known, but Boccob foresaw something that threatened the Balance, and so manipulated a demon prince against her. </p>

<p>Pholtus reviles Abraxas for co-opting his worship, but has thus far been unable to destroy the demon lord. Abraxas, for his part, is perfectly content to see Pholtus and his church thrive, as this gives him still more opportunities to expand his corruption. This puts him in the odd position of supporting and even protecting Pholtus's followers even as they hunt his own servants. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Worshippers</span></p>

<p>Abraxas is responsible for a heretical branch of the Church of Pholtus that teaches the world is a false reality controlled by wicked gods and that only the Blinding Light is real. According to their twisted version of the faith, Pholtus is an emissary of the true god (revealed only to the inner circle to be Abraxas), sent into the false reality to preach knowledge of the true religion. As cultists become more deeply indoctrinated into this sect their contempt for other gods grows until they see law and goodness as instruments of deception designed to keep people chained to the false reality. Ultimately they embrace chaos and evil as holy liberation and become damned to Abraxas's layer of the Abyss. The city of Dimre in the Bandit Kingdoms has outlawed the cult, but the Pale has yet to see the danger.</p>

<p>A Yoradhi village in Ull follows a crude version of the faith that believes they have only to utter the name of Abraxas to ensure their successful transition to the "true" afterlife. They do this with great gusto, screaming the name of the demon lord as a battle cry in counterpoint to the ululations of their Baklunish rivals. A Pholtan missionary from Dyvers ended up becoming converted to this faith, returning to his home city to preach this simple ritual, stripped of the Yoradhi cultural context. In this further debased state, the cult is quite harmless; without the rituals of initiation performed by the Yoradhi cultists, merely speaking Abraxas's name is not enough to damn one's soul to the Abyss. The souls of the flock of beggars and eccentrics the missionary has gathered around him are in no danger as long as no one draws them deeper into Abraxas's creed.</p>

<p>Perhaps because of this, a member of an actual Abraxan cult (disguised within the church of Pholtus) has decided that the strange Yoradhi import must be destroyed. His own leader has counseled that he be left alone in order to avoid drawing unwanted attention to the existence of their own sect, but the assassin has gone off on his own initiative. A series of murders has swept the city, and the culprits seem to be priests of Pholtus. The church of Pholtus denies this, but some insightful adventurers or detectives are needed to identify who is truly responsible. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">History</span></p>

<p>The cult of Abraxas was first recorded in the empire of the Isles of Woe, where a group of former priests of Boccob openly erected a temple to the demon lord in the capital city of Heraan, praying to him for aid in the crafting of magic items. With the fall of that empire, the cult of Abraxas disappeared from the world for a time as well, reappearing centuries later among the Oeridians during their period of subjugation. Worming their way into the church of Pholtus, Abraxas has never left the Oerid people since.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>It's a nice twist on the usual escape from false reality faiths, even individuals from a few factions could be fooled, or an Anarchist cell. The Isles of Woe sounds like a very interesting place, first with the Codex, now with the cult. Maybe they had nalfeshnee judges.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Qirtaia</span> is a djinni slaver. Although he is a dues-paying member of the Planar Trade Consortium, he is an up and comer rather than a Golden Lord and delivers his slaves personally. Rather than pay the costs of rent in Sigil itself, he lives and keeps his slaves in a demiplane called the Plane of Burning Skies, which has convenient access to most of the elemental planes. The portal to Sigil is some ten miles away, in the form of the columns of a ruined temple. The key is herbs that grow in the City of Brass. </p>

<p>Qirtaia's business is strictly legal. Unlike many slavers, he will not accept those who have been kidnapped or captured in battle. He will only deal in chattel sentenced to slavery as punishment for crimes or to pay debts, which makes it easier for him to operate openly. His race actually makes it easier for him to deal with the efreeti and the dao, as they view him as a neutral party, and because he is exiled from his own slavery-hating kind, they have no fear he is working for the djinn. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Doctor Lucretius</span> is a cephalyx, a member of a race that can be described as steampunk mind flayers. Lucretius once worked to keep slave workers healthy in his own society until he was exiled - nearly executed - for transforming a beautiful slave into a cephalyx. The transformed slave was executed, and Lucretius barely escaped through a portal, eventually ending up in the Cage. Lucretius tells everyone his slaves are his assistants. He enslaves only those who cannot pay their debts to him, selling them to Qirtaia. An alhoon is collecting cephalyxes for its hivemind.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">The Hierophant</span> (male LN mercane) was a mercane who helped employ <span style="font-weight:bold">Ambrosius</span> (male N witchwyrd), a witchwyrd merchant who had destroyed the Hierophant's company through methods legal and illegal. Ambrosius's company is now in the hands of <span style="font-weight:bold">Antinomy</span> (female Fated N witchwyrd), Ambrosius's daughter, who has inherited her father's mercantile empire. Antinomy owns a number of businesses in the Market Ward, mostly involving clothing, rope, threads, <span style="font-style:italic">portable holes</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">wells of worlds</span>, and other sundry fabrics. Antinomy spends most of her time managing her businesses and waging commercial war against her rivals, who include mercanes and planar spiders. She is currently being harassed by a mothman who is obsessed with discovering the source of the silk she sells.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I've considered some of these creatures too - and cyclopes, arak brag, stone giants. Tasked builder genies were all slaves and I wanted a third company along with Stone &amp; Cog and Castles in the Sand competing for a tender - if that's the English word. Pechs seem good. Phirblas and shoggoths are weird, can't imagine what would happen. Already have two azers. The Crafters could have their structures in one of the deeper layers of Sigil.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>That's the cool thing about Planescape. You take a thing that seems outlandish or unimaginable. Then you do it anyway, and think through how that would play out given the other things established in the setting. This is how we ended up with things like the great Modron march.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">
