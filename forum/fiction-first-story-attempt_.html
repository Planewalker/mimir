        <div class="dice_rolls">
</div> <p>This is my first attempt at a short Planes-inspired story.  Any opinions (or corrections) would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Isamu slowly circled his opponent, his sword extended and motionless. The expression on his face was calm beyond measure, but there was a hint of contempt there, as well. This sort of contest was below him, but it was his duty. For the moment, at least. </p>

<p>The strange, insectile creature facing him darted its mandibles in for a quick stab. Isamu deflected the blow with a flick of his wrist, and with one perfectly balanced stroke the creature’s mouth-part was severed on the floor and the beast was reeling back in pain. <br />
Isamu was about to pursue his advantage, but before he could move in, three of the thing’s many limbs tried to pull him into an embrace against the poisoned stingers of its midsection. There was no time for thought; moving purely on instinct, Isamu rolled out between two of the thing’s arms while he simultaneously pulled his sword up for a diagonal slice. Before the thing could recover again, he stabbed forward with vicious speed, his katana blade piercing through the creature’s single multifaceted eye socket and into whatever vital organs lay behind it. The beast was on the ground dead almost before Isamu cleaned and sheathed his blade. </p>

<p>The audience erupted into cheers and applause, and the referee held Isamu’s hand high as he presented the man with a paltry purse of gold. Of course, his reasons for being here had nothing to do with these earnings. As far as he was concerned, this was an exhibition, of sorts. Let the commoners see a glimpse of what he had attained; undoubtedly most lacked any true ambition or willpower, but if there was even one talented creature here who might be motivated to join with the Mind’s Eye, then his trip would not be in vain. </p>

<p>The applause were somewhat muted as the next opponent walked quietly into the arena. From this far away, all Isamu could tell was that the enemy was man-shaped, and that it was wearing a dirt-colored cloak with the hood up. As it approached, the hood fell back, revealing an unpleasant surprise. </p>

<p>“Koichi? It can’t possibly be you. How are you still alive?” </p>

<p>The short, lean man opposite him shook his head slowly. There was the ghost of a smile on his face, which shocked Isamu almost as much as the man’s appearance itself. </p>

<p>“The planes are indeed dangerous, brother, but I have made my way. I can’t say that I am surprised to see you here in turn, though. You’ve always had a way of thriving in chaos, which these strange worlds seem to hold aplenty.” </p>

<p>Isamu restrained his anger; it would only weaken him, he knew. “Are you trying to mock me, calling me ‘brother’? You and I both know that I gave up that title the day I left the monastery.” </p>

<p>“We are far from the mountains and vales of our homeland, brother,” the infuriating man responded. “I sometimes doubt we could be any further.” </p>

<p>The crowd was beginning to mutter at the delay. Isamu, knowing that their support was essential to his purposes, drew his blade with a flourish. With an almost unjustifiable lapse in his personal abstinence from sentimentalism, he bowed in the traditional manner before he approached his enemy. </p>

<p>Koichi bowed in turn, no indecision apparent on his face, and drew his katana in turn. He then maintained a defensive stance, and Isamu began to strike with basic attack patterns, which Koichi easily deflected. Isamu wasn’t hoping for a hit. In fact, he highly doubted that he would learn very much of Koichi’s style from these attacks. For the moment, he was only trying to buy enough time to find out what he wanted to know. </p>

<p>“Why are you here, Koichi? If you can come to this city, then surely you can find your way home.” </p>

<p>Koichi shrugged easily. “Apparently, it is not on my Path at this time. I am not sure of the reasons myself, but perhaps there is something here I must do.” </p>

<p>Isamu felt the urge to snort in disgust, but he restrained himself. “Don’t tell me you’re with the Ciphers now? Still neck-deep in that mysticism of yours? Let me fill you in, Koichi. There is no ‘Path’. You should have learned that long before we even left our own backwater little plane. Fate is cruel and arbitrary; I’ve served as its final arbiter enough times to know that. Only a fool would put his life in its hands.” </p>

<p>This time, Koichi did smile. “Then we are all fools, brother, every one of us. And we have little choice in the matter. What else can you hope for?” </p>

<p>Isamu struck a three-hit attack pattern, this time with a bit of bite to it. Of course, Koichi deflected all three blows easily. “There is such a thing as power, Koichi. The power to change Fate. I’ve been working towards it my whole life, and I’ve found the answers within myself. You can’t deny it; I’ve seen the power within you as well. We are both only men, but we have found within ourselves the power to stand against the worst this strange existence has to offer.” </p>

<p>Koichi stepped back and assumed a slightly more exotic stance, sword parallel to the ground, level with his head, and pointed directly at Isamu. “It sounds as if the Mind’s Eye has trained your ego well, brother. But our power is nothing against fate. Come, if you wish it. You know that I will not attack first.” </p>

<p>Isamu stopped his circling, and Koichi did so as well. For a time, the two stood motionless. Isamu stared into the eyes of his oldest friend and oldest surviving enemy, and he saw power there, but it was a strange power. There was a stillness to his enemy’s soul, a silence there that he had never seen. </p>

<p>For seconds, minutes, the two stood utterly motionless, tiny and perfect statues amidst the strewn detritus and bloodstained floors of the vast arena. This time, the crowd did not grow restless. Perhaps even they understood, at some level, that this fight was more than they had ever seen before. Its import had nothing to do with the strength of the two opponents, nor with their spiritual puissance, nor with their long-honed skills. Isamu recognized this fact. This battle was a crystalline moment, a pure clash of will and philosophy unsullied by fear and rage. Each combatant had trained for a lifetime to perfect his technique and form, and perfect they were. The only question that remained was which Path, which philosophy would prove the stronger. Isamu knew deep in his soul that this might well be the best chance he would ever have to prove himself, even if the only witnesses were the drunken lowlifes that patronized this semi-legal gladiator arena. There were only two men currently alive whose opinion of him he valued, and they were both in the arena this day. </p>

<p>The audience was almost completely silent by now, even the most drunken among them aware of the building tension. There was perfect stillness. Then, across the room, an abandoned mug rolled off a table, and shattered. </p>

<p>Simultaneous with the crash, Isamu burst forward with the speed of a wrathful god. His stroke was wide and powerful as he guided his blade for his enemy’s neck. </p>

<p>Almost before he began to move, Koichi moved in response, his neck swinging just below the katana’s arc. Isamu followed through with an elbow strike to his opponent’s midsection to prevent a counterattack as he fell back a step, but his elbow, too, was blocked. As he turned to face Koichi again, he could see that the man’s demeanor had not changed in the slightest. Koichi was smiling, perhaps subtly mocking him, perhaps simply pitying him. <br />
Isamu struck again, slicing downward at Koichi’s head and following up with a kick. Although Koichi was forced to block the slash as expected, the man proved unable to deflect the kick, and he fell back a few paces. His faint smile remained, but Isamu knew now that it was not mocking. Rather, it was… conspiratorial, perhaps? A comrade laughing with you at the foolishness of the world? </p>

<p>Isamu moved into a more complex attack pattern, striking and feinting again and again with a speed and accuracy born of decades of harsh training. At first, it seemed that Koichi was simply lucky in his dodges and parries, but Isamu soon realized that this was something different. Koichi moved with a speed that was beyond the speed of human reaction, until it almost appeared a sort of prescience. He was moving in tune with something beyond what he could see, Isamu knew that much. Perhaps he really had found it, after all – the Path, the Pattern, Tao, whatever it was called in this realm. Perhaps he really had transcended. <br />
So much the better, Isamu decided. If Koichi moved in time with Fate, then he would simply alter Fate. It would not be the first time he had done so. </p>

<p>Isamu was only partially aware that he was screaming; all he could feel was the energy awakening in his soul and coursing through his body. His method went beyond thought, beyond even instinct now, and he moved with a potence and an absolute authority that defied all opposition. His sword was now secondary; his will was his blade, and with it he would cut the chains of destiny. <br />
If anything, Koichi only grew faster and calmer in response to Isamu’s redoubled attacks, but now, it was Isamu who held the advantage. Far in the back of his mind, he was aware that his muscles were burning with unnatural strain and his throat was sore from his screams, but he paid these things no heed. Finally, when he had Koichi on the retreat, he shifted into his riskiest attack: amidst a series of slashes and counterparries, he pulled his sword high once more, and struck down with a force born of immutable willpower. </p>

<p>Only when they burst suddenly into applause did Isamu remember the crowd’s existence. He looked to his opponent, and sure enough, Koichi’s fractured blade and severed right hand lay on the floor in a gathering pool of blood. </p>

<p>Exhilaration rose in him for one beautiful moment, until he felt a sharp pressure on the back of his neck. Sure enough, the remaining fragment of a katana held in Koichi’s left hand was pressed to his neck. The other man had moved in sequence with him; had Koichi so wished, Isamu would now be dead. <br />
He collapsed to the ground and allowed his head to bow in a rare display of emotion – in this case, defeat. “You win, Koichi.” But his head rose once again, and he continued, with a hint of lingering pride, “but it did cost you. I couldn’t shatter your fate, but I did bend it.” </p>

<p>Koichi’s tiny grin widened slightly as he dropped his sundered weapon. He held up the bleeding stump of his hand, and with a whisper of a healing sutra, the bleeding quickly slowed and stopped. “You did indeed succeed where few others could, my brother. For all your denials, I think there is a spark of true understanding somewhere within you.” </p>

<p>Isamu looked up with annoyance. “You wound my pride, Koichi. Kill me here, and avenge those I’ve wronged. Strike me down and I perhaps I can still face my ancestors with some honor to my name.” </p>

<p>Koichi shook his head and pulled Isamu up from the ground. “I’m no avenger, brother, and no Dustman. I didn’t come here to kill you. In fact, I believe I’ve done whatever it was I came for. Now I suppose I’ll get myself to a healer before I forget how many fingers they’re supposed to give me.” </p>

<p>Rage burned within Isamu at an almost unbearable level. “You would release me then, without condition and without punishment? Know, then, that you are a fool, Takamura Koichi! I will find my power, and I will wield it against you. I won’t alter my Path for your misplaced pity!” </p>

<p>Koichi nodded solemnly. “When you believe you can take more than a hand from me, find me again, brother. I’m sure you won’t have any trouble doing so. Our fates seem intertwined, in some way at least.” </p>

<p>Isamu nodded curtly. “That is one fate, at least, that I will not fight. I will see you again, Koichi.” </p>

<p>Koichi bowed low as he left the arena, and Isamu replied in kind, out of long-forgotten reflex as much as intent. He wiped and sheathed his katana and strode slowly out of the arena. There would be no recruitment tonight, he was sure. Any witness worthy of the attention of the Mind’s Eye would have recognized the true victor of that battle, despite the purse of gold now being pressed into Isamu’s hand. As he wandered out of the arena through one of Sigil’s less savory areas, he began to ponder what he must do to improve himself. He was not so foolish as to believe that he could ever attain the power to fight everything there was in this odd world beyond worlds, but Koichi was different. Koichi had always been his proving ground, the flip side to his own character that had given him focus. Once he had spilled into the multiverse of the Planes, Isamu had thought he had left Koichi far beyond him along with the rest of his past life, but it would now appear otherwise. </p>

<p>For the first time that night, for the first time in months, Isamu smiled himself. He had a yardstick again. He had his nemesis back. </p>

<p>------------ </p>

<p>As soon as he was out of Isamu’s sight, Koichi focused his internal energy again and used his healing sutra again, this time restoring his hand fully. As he wound his own path through the dark streets of Sigil, he too reflected. It was not as common an act as it once had been for him, since much of his learning had taught him to choose stillness of mind over meandering thought. But tonight was different. </p>

<p>As usual, his movements had been guided by what some would call intuition, and what the knowing would call the guidance of the Path. It had led him to a reunion he had long expected, if not hoped for. And he had learned much this night, accomplished much, if he judged the situation rightly. </p>

<p>Isamu walked the same Path as he, the Path of the Warrior. He began that road for different reasons that Isamu, and thought to take a different route, but the result would be the same. <br />
The warrior had shown a spark tonight. He thought he was battling destiny, but in truth, he was simply beginning to sense its presence. The Path of the Warrior is the Path of All Things, after all, and if one seeks true mastery in one Path, one will become a master in all Paths. </p>

<p>Koichi did not doubt that they would battle again someday, and that in that fight, he might lose more than a valuable sword and a dispensable hand. But someday, sooner or later, Isamu would find the enlightenment he was forcing upon himself, and if the warrior had the strength to finally subsume his pride and arrogance once and for all, the Transcendent Order would have a powerful new member. </p>

<p>He shook his head dismissively and chuckled at himself as he continued walking, paying literally no attention to where he was wandering, letting the Path guide his steps. He claimed to be a devoted follower, and yet he guessed and second-guessed the Path’s intent at every turn. He cleared his mind of the useless clutter of planning and forward thinking, and his customary smile spread back over his face. </p>

<p>Few would ever truly understand, but it was a smile of enlightenment, a smile of true bliss.</p>

         <p>The formatting of the text is a bit odd when it was posted. I'd suggest editing it and putting in paragraph breaks. Otherwise it's really hard to read. And when that happens people tend to skip over stories that are otherwise good. I've learned this lesson the hard way myself. <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/smile.png" title="Smiling" alt="Smiling" class="smiley-content"/></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Damned ambitious topic for a first story - I like, there were points in there where it seemed like it slowed down for you to 'look at' much like some of the best scenes in movies like Hero. So very well handled there.</p>

<p>I'm curious to see a few more bits regarding their shared history - or perhaps some more exact points on where the Mind's Eye philosophy is carrying him through or differing from the Cipher's approach to things.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>The thing that most interests me about the Planescape setting is the philosophies that've been devised, especially for the different factions.  But as a newbie, I was afraid of messing up some of the specifics of any given faction's outlook, so I cheated a bit, and focused the story on a couple of Primes who are taking their own personal philosophies and fitting it to their factions.</p>

<p>I could definitely write more about the characters' backgrounds and specific ideologies, if enough people actually want to read it.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Heh.  I'm actually a philosophy major... the thing is, I'm focusing here more on Eastern philosophies that are developed a little differently than most of the stuff I've studied, so I'm trying to be careful there.  It's kind of hard to construct logical arguments against philosophies that are based in mysticism, which is illogical by definition.  But yeah, I'll post another "episode" fairly soon, I guess.  I'll just stick it on the end of this thread.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>OK, part 2.  It starts with different characters, but trust me, it works in to the main plot.</p>

<p>The young man standing nervously on a street corner in the Lady's Ward was obviously a bit nervous.  His long, thin fingers were constantly reaching up to his face to push his thick, round spectacles up his nose, and he held a sheath of papers close to his chest as if they were his only defense from the vagaries of the outside world.</p>

<p>After a few moments of standing and watching, the man found what he considered a likely (and safe) subject: a young woman, aasimar judging from her silvery hair and violet eyes.  With a stammering voice and a mild accent that betrayed his Prime upbringing, he hesitantly tapped the woman on the shoulder.</p>

<p>"Ah... ex, excuse me, madame.  Could I take a moment of your time?  I promise that it will be worth your - worth your while, that is."</p>

<p>The woman glared at him narrowly.  "If this is a pick-up line, you're not very good at it, boy."</p>

<p>The man shook his head so violently that the spectacles almost flew off his face.  "Not - no, not at all, I assure - that is, I meant to say that..."  He took a deep breath, exhaled slowly, and started again.</p>

<p>"Hello.  You see, I'm studying in Rathien Moonshade's School of Rational Arcana, and I'm - I need to write a thesis on the logical basis and metaphysical implications of the Ring-Givers' karmic principle as applied in scientifically ascertainable..."</p>

<p>The woman snorted in disbelief.  "You're a Guvner!  They have a mage school for you people now?  Unbelievable!"</p>

<p>She began to turn away, until he blurted out, "I'm giving out free money!"</p>

<p>The woman turned back to him, her expression suddenly much more amenable.  "I'm listening."</p>

<p>"Well, it is my hypothesis that the truth-value of the karmic principle can be empirically ascertained under controlled and measurable circumstances, so long as..."</p>

<p>"Could you cut to the chase?  I'm in a bit of a hurry here," the woman cut in, rolling her eyes ever so subtly.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes.  Well, here you are," the mage said, tossing a small pouch of change over to the woman.  "Just take this, then."</p>

<p>She glanced at him suspiciously again.  "That's it?  No strings attached?"</p>

<p>He nodded rapidly, again almost displacing his precariously perched spectacles.  "None but the metaphysical sort, if the Ring-givers are right.  Do what you want with it.  I'll hand out quite a few of these pouches, and then monitor any changes in my financial situation over the coming few months.  That way, I should be able to calculate, within a reasonable margin of error, the precise efficacity of karmic influence..."</p>

<p>"Yes, well, that's all right then," the woman put in quickly.  She turned to leave again, but then, out of sheer curiosity, she turned back to him once again."</p>

<p>"You never did tell me your name, mageling.  I'm Kharana Lightwing."</p>

<p>The young maun bobbed his head obsequiously.  "Well met, well met.  My name is Galvym the Mauve."</p>

<p>The woman raised a curious eyebrow.  "The mauve?  That's the best color you could get?"</p>

<p>Galvym sighed, and launched into what was obviously a prepared explanation.  "Our esteemed teacher, Rathien Moonshade, is of the opinion that the most logical system of naming is to systematicially work one's way through the color spectrum.  I happened to be between Vermillion and Evergreen, so I'm Mauve."</p>

<p>Kharana's eyebrow raised even higher.  "How is mauve between vermillion and evergreen?"</p>

<p>Galvym sighed even more deeply.  "Rathien's colorblind.  We just don't have the heart to tell him."</p>

<p>The aasimar woman put a hand to her mouth to cover an involuntary smile.  "I... I see.  Well, it was good to meet you, Galvym the Mauve.  I hope you earn your... thesis, or whatever.  And thanks for the jink."</p>

<p>Once the woman had turned the corner and moved out of sight, Galvym let out his held breath, pulled out a pice of charcoal, and began rapidly scribbling notes on a blank piece of paper.  One down, 499 to go.</p>

<p>----------------</p>

<p>Kharana idly counted the jink she had received as she walked the last few blocks to her destination.  Finally she stopped in front of a small house, relatively humble for its surroundings, and knocked on the door in a particular pattern.  It sprang open of its own accord, and she strolled inside.</p>

<p>A gentle smile touched her lips when she saw the man dressed in ratty robes in the corner.  He was sitting on the floor, despite several perfectly good chairs around him, and finishing off the tiniest portion of bread and soup she'd ever seen in this opulent neighborhood.  But despite the rags and the bad food, he was smiling more serenely than any noble she had ever seen.</p>

<p>She tossed the small coin purse over to him.  Without ever lifting his eyes from his meal, he caught it in one hand.  "What is this, my friend?"</p>

<p>"Money, Koichi.  Some idiot's giving it away down the street."  She sat in the most comfortable chair available and pulled a thick book off the shelf, then began reading.  "You should go talk with him; gods know you could use a little charity, if you're eating less than my cat."</p>

<p>Koichi waved his chopsticks in dismissal as he tossed the purse back.  "I have as much as I need.  But why would anyone in this city just give out money on the street corner?  Charity is not exactly..."  He seemed to be trying to put this nicely.</p>

<p>Kharana laughed.  "You're not going to hurt my feelings, Koichi.  Being a planar doesn't mean I don't see Sigil for what it is.  Charity isn't free here, I know that."</p>

<p>"What then?  Is this man one of those Ring people?"</p>

<p>"Well, not quite.  He's actually a Guvner doing research on them.  He thinks he can measure the karmic something-or-other."</p>

<p>Koichi chuckled lightly.  "The Fraternity of Order does seem to interest itself in the most unexpected things.  Now they are trying to quantify karma?  Well, I suppose there is always a chance.  But all they will do is add one more restriction to their understanding of this universe."</p>

<p>Kharana wasn't about to get sucked into a philosophical debate with the monk.  Her naturally benificent disposition put her more in line with him than with some other of her fellow Ciphers, who often tended to long exposititory speeches on the illusory nature of "good" and "evil."  She believed in the Cadence and much as any of them, but Koichi here was one of the few who seemed to agree with her that a truly balanced nature would tend towards the benefit of all - "good" by definiton. But despite their commonalities, Kharana wasn't going to embrace Koichi's total rejection of knowledge anytime soon.</p>

<p>"Well, I didn't come here to chat about handouts, Koichi.  I was actualy hoping to find you here.  There's something going on that I think you should know about."</p>

<p>The monk put down his chopsticks and gave her his full attention, and she continued.  "I got a hold of the entrants list for the big fey arena tournament coming up, and there was a name in there that sounded kind of weird.  'Iroku Shinji,' and he signed his name with these runes that look a lot like yours."  She handed a poster over to him, and after looking at it for a moment, he sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>"This is surprising, indeed.  You were right in your guess; this man is indeed from my world, and he is not unknown to me.  If he and brother Isamu are both in Sigil, it seems very likely that I will soon become entangled in whatever they plan."  He picked up his bowl from the ground, slurped down the remnants of his soup and rice, and put the wooden vessel back into the canvas pouch at his side.  Not for the first time, Kharana noted how the shabby state of his clothes and person were contrasted by the exquisite shine of the sword at his waist.  Whatever his strange interpretations of the Cadence, he was a warrior through and through, and Kharana had to respect him for that.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" she asked, as he moved quickly for the door out of the safehouse.</p>

<p>He bowed low as he turned back to her and put on the sandals he had left near the door.  "As always, I go where the Path takes me.  But in this case, I believe I must go to see this tournament."</p>

<p>Kharana ran after him as he walked out the door.  "Wait!  I'm coming with you.  I've promised some people I'd... keep an eye on things."</p>

<p>Most people would have questioned her on this point, but Koichi simply nodded.  "Come then."</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Actually, yeah... I entered a secondary character into the tournament (so that if he died, the plot wouldn't be ruined).  Hopefully, the plot can be affected by the tourney results... if it ever happens, that is.</p>

<p>I should have another installment up pretty soon.  Keep your eyes peeled, all you readers out there (a.k.a. Clueless <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/wink.png" title="Eye-wink" alt="Eye-wink" class="smiley-content"/> ).</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Despite his casual stride, Koichi walked with inordinate speed, and Kharana had to nearly march to keep up.  His face was as calm as ever, the image of the successful Cipher, but the monk was obviously trying to get somewhere quickly.</p>

<p>"Exactly where are you headed, anyway?  The tournament's not for days!" she muttered.</p>

<p>Koichi turned to her, his expression slightly puzzled.  "As always, Kharana Lightwing, I go where the Path - the Cadence - leads me."</p>

<p>Kharana's silvery hair whipped against her face as she shook her head.  "Yes ultimately, of course, but just where would that be at the moment?  Following the Cadence doesn't mean you can't act rationally once in a while."</p>

<p>The aasimar could see in the monk a clear desire to lecture her on the ways of the Cadence, but thankfully, he bit it back.  "I believe I will try to seek out this man of my world.  If this tournament has not yet-"</p>

<p>He was cut off by a sharp cry from across the street.  Kharana's eyes snapped to its source, a familiar-looking young man in purplish robes who was currently surrounded by several rather irreputable-looking bashers.</p>

<p>"I'm telling you, you can keep the jink!  It's - I'm giving it to you!" the mageling was stammering in a panicked tone.</p>

<p>"That ain't what it seems to me," said a tallish tiefling with all the trademark body language of an alpha thug.  "Seems to me I'm <span style="font-style:italic">taking</span> what I want, and it seems to me like a berk like you givin' away jink must have a nice stash stowed away for... special occasions."</p>

<p>Now, Kharana knew her limitations.  She was no Cipher warrior like Koichi; in fact, despite almost a half-century in the Transcendental Order, she'd probably rank no higher than an acolyte, if anyone of the Ciphers ranked people that way.  She realized that her allegiance to the faction probably came more from a sense of duty to her father than it did to any deep dedication to tranquility or action without thought or any of the other key ideals.  But one thing she <span style="font-style:italic">had</span> learned in her fifty years of service was when to follow an instinct, and she knew that this was just such a time.</p>

<p>Kharana moved with little of the liquid grace of a monk; her style was a bit more direct.  She simply rushed up to the lead thug and slammed him up against the wall.  The man began to struggle, but calmed quite a bit when he felt the tip of Kharana's dagger gently rub up to his throat.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't be bothering my good friend Gavin here, would you?" </p>

<p>"It's Gavrym," the still-panting mage muttered from beside her, reaching around the pavestones for the spectacles that had finally lost their tenacious grip on his nose.  When he finally retrieved them, the Guvner looked about to see three very angry-looking thugs who weren't currently being held against a wall by anyone, and made the rapid calculation that it might be a good idea not to draw too much attention to himself at the moment.</p>

<p>The aasimar stared at the tiefling in threatening silence, and the tiefling returned the gesture from his uncomfortable position against the wall.  In truth, Kharana wasn't feeling nearly as threatening as she wished at the moment.  Her hope had been that a brave front would scare these muggers off to look for easier game, but it seemed that she had crossed some sort of line and wounded the leader's pride, which could be very bad indeed.  She knew how to handle herself in combat all right, but these low-lifes did it for a living, and they had her outnumbered three to one, even if she took out the boss.  Besides that, she didn't particularly want to start her afternoon with a murder on her conscience.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Damn it,</span> she thought to herself, <span style="font-style:italic">where did that monk go?</span>  She couldn't risk looking behind her to spot Koichi, for fear that she would be gutted the second she turned away from this increasingly angry-looking tiefling.</p>

<p>"Now then, do you think we can all play nice, and go our separate ways?" she gambled.  Letting the man go could prove a costly mistake, but it could also avoid a bit of bloodshed.</p>

<p>"You've got it," the tiefling said in a low voice.  He shoved her knife-arm away from his throat and stepped away, motioning for his toadies to fall in line.</p>

<p>Kharana lowered her blade in relief, but as soon as she did so, the tiefling rushed forward, his own dagger in hand.  She parried his stab with her own dagger, wishing to every deity she had ever heard of that she had worn her armor today.  The tiefling stabbed again and slashed viciously, so hard that she almost missed the quick jab from his left hand, which now almost miraculously had another dagger in it.</p>

<p>She got an arm up to block, but the blade scratched down her forearm.  A broad counter-slash forced the man to fall back for a brief moment while Kharana evaluated her options.  They didn't look good; the three henchmen were beginning to circle around, and she couldn't get away without risking a knife in the back.  This tiefling wasn't an unbeatable opponent in himself, but four on one...</p>

<p>Strange muttering behind her reminded Kharana that strictly speaking, it was four on two.  For a moment she thought the nervous man had simply gone mad from fear, but then she heard some of the words he was muttering.</p>

<p>"Multiply by the arcsine of the interplanar wave differential and extrapolate with Gjoral's Constant... divide the elemental geometry vector... over pi..."</p>

<p>The mage's unfamiliar incantation ended with the improbably phrase "CARRY THE ONE!"  But before Kharana could begin to question his sanity again, she felt the familiar  tug of arcane energies, until a shimmering globe of icy mist popped into existence right in front of her and began rapidly moving towards the tiefling.</p>

<p>For once, the head thug's movements were a little too slow, and he cried out in sharp pain as his left shoulder was bitten by the devilish cold.  At this display of magical puissance, the four muggers turned to run almost in unison.  The icy orb continued to follow after them (presumably at Gavrym's direction), but Kharana had no desire to join it.  Instead, she turned in surprise to the young mage.</p>

<p>"What in the Nine Hells was that?  If you can summon up a ball of ice, why didn't you do that in the first place?"</p>

<p>Gavrym looked a bit abashed.  "You thought it was a ball too, huh?  Everyone thinks it's a ball, but it's actually a dodecahedron.  When you look closely, it's a pretty obvious difference."</p>

<p>"And you!" Kharana snapped, pointing at Koichi, who she now saw had been standing calmly not five feet away the whole time, "what were you thinking, making me fight them alone?  You could have taken all four of them out six times over before they knew what hit-" </p>

<p>A crossbow twanged in the distance.  Kharana had time for exactly three thoughts: first, "A crossbow!  I wonder who's getting shot at!" followed immediately by, "If Gavrym's talking to me, he's not concentrating on keeping that ice thing moving," which was directly postceded with, "OhsweetmercifuldeitiesandguardiansofthesevenheavensI'MGONNADIE!"</p>

<p>After a period of standing stock still with eyes closed that retrospectively seemed embarrassingly long, Kharana's brain reactivated to the pleasant realization that she was not, indeed, gonna die.  She opened her eyes again to see an arrow held less than a foot away from her face in the hands of the nonchalant Koichi.</p>

<p>The enigmatic warrior bowed slightly.  "There.  I helped.  I believe that our unfriendly associates are gone for good this time, but in the future, you might want to stay a bit more focused in battle.  The battlefield is, after all, a paradigm example of the efficacity of Cipher philosophy, and unneccesary distraction is contrary to such philosophy, as you surely are aware."  Kharana grunted in return, secretly tallying up more evidence to support her theory that the size of the words this monk used was directly proportional to how annoying he got.</p>

<p>Kharana turned back to Gavrym for the moment.  "So then, what kind of wizard's spell was that?  I don't think I've ever heard of an... 'ice dodecahedron' spell before, and I've known quite a few wizards."</p>

<p>The scholarly mage grinned broadly and pushed his glasses back up his nose.  "Did - did you enjoy that one?  I derived the original formula myself, from the fairly common 'flaming orb' spell.  I had to make it a dodecahedron, though, because I couldn't get the calculus to work right for the sphere.  Got quite a few points off for that little shortcut."  He shook his head morosely in memorium of his subpar grade, then perked right back up again.  "But switching the corollary paraelemental coefficient from the Plane of Fire to the Demiplane of Cold, that one was on the fly.  I figured that, well, if a tiefling's part demon, you see, then they're probably immune to fire, if you think about it."  Though he seemed less sure on this last point, Gavrym the Mauve was obviously quite fascinated with this abstruse magical theory stuff.</p>

<p>Kharana nodded thoughtfully, trying not to seem condescending.  "Well, most of them actually aren't <span style="font-style:italic">that</span> resistant to fire, but certainly more so than humans.  That was a good move, I guess, but if you're ever in a situation like that again, try a spell a little earlier, eh?  I was almost cut in half trying to save your skin, and you could've just taken those idiots all out magically anytime you wanted."</p>

<p>Gavrym drew in a wincing breath at the comment.  "Um, yes.  Well, I'm very sorry, of course, very much obliged, and I guess you paid me back in full quicker than I expected.  It's just that when they were harrassing me, I was so confused, at first I thought they were just in it for a bit of joking, like kids on a schoolyard, but when he flashed a knife, I just... I couldn't focus on what to do, there were so many things running through my mind..."</p>

<p>"Ahh, that's right," Kharana remembered.  "I grabbed this off the tiefling while I was holding him."  She tossed a fairly large sack towards the mage, and it made a metallic clank as it hit his chest.  Gavrym began to tuck the bag under his robes with a feeble attempt at subtlety, but then thought the better of it.</p>

<p>"Er - Excuse me!" he said to a passing githzerai man.  "Please take this money as a gift."  And with that, he tossed the bag heavy with coins into the unsuspecting gith's hands and quickly turned away.  The githzerai, meanwhile, took one look inside the bag and, apaprently deciding not to look a gift-horse in the mouth, he started moving quite quickly the other way.</p>

<p>"Not as random and broadly distrubuted a sample as I might've wanted, but it'll have to do," the Guvner mumbled apologetically.  He then pulled out a much smaller sack of coins and held it up.  "Now then, who's in for a drink?  I think I owe you both a lot more than that, but it's a start.  I know a great tavern in the neighborhood."</p>

<p>"Certainly, Gavrym," Kharana said quickly before Koichi could object.  "After all," she added with a pointed glance at the monk, "that certainly is the place one would go to relax, or hypothetically to pick up some helpful information on various things."</p>

<p>"Er - yes.  I guess so," Gavrym said with some confusion, obviously missing the hidden message.  "Actually, I do believe that quite a few of our researchers have based a large body of their work on empirical data gathered in such establishments."  The young man of strange passions went on to detail the discoveries of one Agris J. Comble, the first Guvner to detail the mechanics of what he called the 'catalystic effect of mild intoxication upon a reduced standard of societally implied mating acceptability standards,' which a later pundit renamed 'beer goggles.'  Meanwhile, Koichi and Kharana listened quietly and politely; Koichi because he was carefuly ignoring the stream of especially useless 'mental clutter' spewing forth from the young man's mouth, and Kharana because she was beginning to develop a sort of fondness for this strange little Prime wizard.</p>

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>The tavern certainly wasn't the best the Lady's Ward had to offer.  The walls and floors were black, though whether there might be another color underneath the caked grime was another question entirely.  A bar stretched across the far wall of the establishment, complete with a particularly dour and weathered bartender of the sort that one would think only exists in the realm of stereotype.  Currently, the man (for he seemed to be a human male of middling years) was sitting behind the bar smoking a long pipe and patently ignoring the half-drunk students clamoring for more drinks.  Of the many people clustered in small groups near the bar or at tables, a disturbing number wore dark cloaks that disguised their faces.</p>

<p>As Galvym led the two Ciphers in, Kharana's eyes widened and her hand went straight to her dagger.  Even Koichi seemed a bit taken aback at the kid's choice of drinking establishment.  Gavrym, meanwhile, walked up to the bar with a mild, utterly oblivious grin and patted the drowsing bartender on the shoulder.</p>

<p>"Hey, Gimmy!  It's Galvym!" he said amiably, and he was rewarded with a scowl for the ages.  But, surprisingly, the man behind the bar stood up and said, with only a hint of grumble in his voice, "Good ta have ye back, Mr.... 'the Mauve.'  What'll it be?"</p>

<p>"Three pints of your finest brew, in your cleanest glasses!" the mageling responded, and the bartender moved with surprising speed (for a man who obviously weighed well over 300 pounds) to fetch the drinks, even giving the mugs a quick and ineffectual wipe with a grayish cloth before filling them up.</p>

<p>"You see, a student like myself- well, we end up paying quite a bit of tuition," Galvym was saying.  "It's always a good idea to find a cheap local tavern for food and entertainment, and this was the cheapest and closest I could find!"  He gestured around the filth-encrusted establishment, obviously proud of his find.</p>

<p>"How very... yes," Kharana replied as politely as possible.  "Aren't a little worried about being stabbed, mugged, or horribly mutilated?"</p>

<p>"No, not really," the young man replied glibly.  He leaned in closer and added in a conspiratorial tone, "You see, first day I got here I showed off my Negative Energy Line Segment a bit, and the word spread kind of quick."</p>

<p>"Huh," Kharana responded.  She hadn't really thought the kid had it in him.</p>

<p>The beer was surprisingly good, and although Koichi refused to drink anything but water (to the bartender's chagrin), Kharana drained a few pints quickly to dull her senses to the Guvner's ongoing stream of discussion about his thesis, his studies, and gods knew what else.</p>

<p>Kharana was nodding along to Galvym's demonstration of basic thaumaturgical principles (a rather flashy and impressive display, she had to concede) when Koichi suddenly jumped to his feet, hand on the hilt of his blade.  "I must thank you for your hospitality," he said quietly, "but I must do something now.  I would highly recommend that the two of you do not follow me, as the situation could become dangerous."</p>

<p>Kharana giggled slightly.  "Yeah, sure, Koichi.  I'm gonna let you go off all by yourself in a place like this.  I don't care how good you are with that sword, you're gonna get yourself in trouble if I'm not here."  She jumped off of the barstool as well, and immediately wondered if the room had been spinning like this when they got here.  "Good beer," she told the bartender contentedly.</p>

<p>"Err... maybe I should come too," Galvym said as he grabbed Kharana by the shoulder to keep her from toppling over.</p>

<p>Koichi looked at the two of them, closed his eyes for a moment, and then nodded slowly.  "I suppose you should.  This way, then," the monk said, as he carefully approached a particularly shadowy figure seated across the room.</p>
