</div> <p>Just a general question:<br />
Are there any more of the Outer Planes that need a major renovation? I know that several elemental planes could use it; but I think the gaps on the Great Ring are pretty well filled in. </p>

<p>*Arcadia - Done<br />
*Bytopia - Done<br />
*Gehenna - Done</p>

<p>*Outlands - while not an official part of the PRP, the lengthy discussion of incorporating elements of the Wild West fleshed this one out for me. <br />
If you don't like that theme, I suppose this plane could use some work</p>

<p>I'm fairly happy with the rest of the Outer Planes; but I was wondering which ones other people felt still need some work</p>       </div>

         <p>You may have a point there. I gave Carceri an extreme makeover. The end result is something that is pretty well fleshed out and rife with adventure ideas for me; so I never cared if the PRP handled it.<br />

         <p>I i'd be interested in seeing your take on Carceri, Palomides. I'd hate to see you holding back for fear of being branded a heretic. Don't be shy.</p>

<p>I've never thought it was lacking, though, personally. It has a clear theme (traitors, imprisoned by the eternal cycle of betrayal). It functions well as an inverted reflection of the Beastland's wild nature and as the opposite of Bytopia's benevolent community (Bytopia is where everyone gets along, their strengths complementary; Carceri is treachery, where relationships are eternally undermined by mistrust; Bytopia is I scratch your back and you scratch mine while Carceri is I stab your back and you stab mine). It has a distinctive, interesting native race (the gehreleths, though I also love the gautiere). It has an obvious plot hook (something treacherous is trying to escape. Stop it.). It has a very distinctive look. Even each layer has its own explicit theme. Though I think Gehenna is fine too, I agree that it's much more of an evil miscellany than Carceri is, a muddle of 'loths, thieves, warriors, and wizards, much more defined by its physical nature than Carceri. Carceri made it to 4e virtually unscathed, while Gehenna was transformed into the realms of Tiamat and Zehir.</p>

<p>The only plane I thought has been consistently poorly done is Bytopia. It's clear that no one at TSR/WOTC ever quite knew what to do with it. It's been relegated to being the gnome plane or the happy peasant plane, and the few native sapients it was given (air sentinel and adamantine dragon) didn't fit with the plane's themes and never caught on. I was happy with my own interpretations and additions, but I never actually looked at the Bytopia rehabilitation thread on these boards. I think I meant to, but got distracted and forgot.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I actually like Carceri as presented in the Planes of Conflict. One of my favorite planes to read about -- also one of the places I definitely do <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> want to go as a real person.</p>

<p>Here are a couple ideas I think could use expanding on.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Acheron</span> - We know it's a plane of battles but that's about it. We could easily key off renovated Arcadia and reinvent Acheron as a dark mirror of everything Arcadia represents. Where governments function for the benefit of the people on Arcadia and rules of war are observed and practiced, such things are taken to an extreme or turned wrong in Acheron. A theme of power/government for the sake of military might rings well to my ears and keeps in line with Acheron's lawful nature.</p>

<p>It bounces off Arcadia. On Arcadia, government and warfare is highly ordered but exists as a benevolent force. All government systems function for the betterment of the people they rule. On Acheron, the hierarchy exists for the sake of conquest and brutal military authority.</p>

<p>It also bounces well against Ysgard. Ysgard's first layer represents battle for glory. Acheron represents battle for conquest and power; Glory is irrelevant unless you seize power and authority with it. Wars are waged to gain more ground and resources and it doesn't matter who you have to run over to get it.</p>

<p>Most of the remaining Upper Planes could use a renovation -- and honestly I think many of the untouched planes could stand to get remodeled a little bit.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Ysgard</span> -- Ysgard feels to me like TSR took a bunch of disparate ideas, shoved them in a bundle, and said "Here, this is the plane between CG and CN." I like the theme on the first layer -- glorious warfare. Beyond that I just don't feel like there's much to unify the plane. Muspelheim and Nidavellir just don't have that much to keep them tied to the first layer other than Norse mythology -- which I do not feel is enough to make a whole plane out of...Especially not when Olympus is just a segment of Arborea and other major pantheons hardly dominate the planes they're found on.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Gray Waste</span> -- The despair and depression angle is a great conflict but Niflheim and Pluton are not well-used, especially Pluton. They feel like afterthoughts to the "more important" Oinos. Could use something to tie them in more.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Arborea</span> -- Another plane that, like Ysgard, I feel is a bit disparate. Less random than Ysgard but could use a stronger plane-wide binding.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Pandemonium</span> -- I'll probably get shot for saying this but...While Pandemonium is one of the better unified planes (the theme of howling winds through caves and madness and all that), it is not particularly <span style="font-style:italic">exciting</span>. That is, you look at the plane and what's there? Wind. Insane people. Bleakers. Loki. And a layer that probably has the one thing that can destroy the multiverse or whatever. Otherwise what is there really?</p>

<p>I think the Beastlands largely do fine on their own. I am hard-pressed right now to come up with ideas that dramatically improve it. </p>

<p>Celestia more or less works for me. I can't come up with anything specific to make it better. I can see how the rigidness of the archons would make the plane difficult for several adventuring parties, though.</p>

<p>Mechanus might be worth looking at down the road but I don't feel any immediate need to deal with it. Same with Limbo.</p>

<p>It may be better to wait on the Outlands until more Outer Planes are rehashed.</p>

<p>Also, I believe pretty much every Inner Plane other than the ones already touched could use some sprucing up. Introduce some of those concepts we discussed in the Pos thread, Palomides. I think the best way to introduce conflict and great adventure hooks is to incorporate the themes and beliefs into the plane.</p>

<p>Perhaps I should set up a wiki or something for quick reference. Or if anyone wants to take one plane at a time and really get down to the nitty-gritty and produce a modest, <span style="font-style:italic">fluff-heavy</span> netbook (say 100-150 pages of content, tops) about it, let me know. We could start with one of our planes that we've already renovated. I have access to Acrobat so I could produce a PDF. It would take a while to produce even one plane and produce it well, but it might make a good direction for the project eventually.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

</div></p>

<p>Agreed.<br />
I excluded the Inner Planes from my initial question because, as you say, most of them are pretty undeveloped and could all arguably use a renovation at some level</p>

<p>Your second point is a very good one. With the Outer Planes, I usually have no problem finding conflict in variations of the central theme of the plane or in conflict with opposing plane(s)</p>

<p>But based on some comments I made on the elemental planes on another thread, I should remember to find sources when thinking about the Inner Planes too. My preference for "raw elemental power" doesn't lead to very interesting conflicts (other than survival)</p>

<p>As prep work for a more formal approach to the renovation project, I think it might be useful to make a list of attributes that a well-developed plane should include. Currently, I aim for the following:<br />
*Unique overall theme(s)<br />
*Unique terrain<br />
*Reason(s) for PCs to visit<br />
*Philosophical opposite(s) - e.g. Acheron has a "mirror" relationship to both Arcadia and Ysgard<br />
*Conflict within the plane - e.g. on Arcadia (after renovation) we had the different groups with their different plans to achieve Utopia in conflict with each other<br />
*At least one unique representative species (prefereably one that embodies one or more themes of the plane)</p>

<p>Any other suggestions for this list?</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>ripvanwormer</em> wrote:</div>I'd be interested in seeing your take on Carceri, Palomides. I'd hate to see you holding back for fear of being branded a heretic. Don't be shy.</div></p>

<p>I was holding back until someone actually started a PRP for Carceri; but since you were kind enough to ask</p>

<p>First thing, I know that a variety of different types of titans/primoridals/diposed elemental lords/etc. are imprisoned here; but for convenience, I will be refering to all of them as "titans".</p>

<p>I may not have the standard layout of the plane correct in my head as layers existing through separate "beads" is a bit paradoxical (not that there aren't a lot of other cool paradoxes across the planes).<br />
But the existance of the beads which (if I understand correctly) each hold an imprisoned titan in their innermost shells, made me think of the beads as prison cells. </p>

<p>This in turn made me think of the Panopticon prison structure<br />
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panopticon" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panopticon">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panopticon</a> (see the third picture especially)<br />
I changed the layout of the plane so that the beads/cells circled a central cylinder (of infinite length) that is said to hold a great jailor god that insures that the inmates don't escape. (I envisioned him as sort of a god-like Mercykiller with no pity). The beads circle around this central cylander at a set radius and are tied back to it at spots with enormous chains (Jangling Hiter-sized chains)<br />
The inmates have never seen this god. They don't know if and when he is watching them. Some even wonder if he even exists. All that they know is that all attempts at escape (with VERY rare exceptions) have always been thwarted.</p>

<p>The titans can either plot their escapes (which always fail - increasing their bitterness) or they can focus on tormenting those beings trapped in the spheres with them. This is a pointless activity that ends in no useful results; but this torment can distract the titan briefly. <br />
While I did have each bead have several layers within each other, I didn't keep the connected layers. In my set up, each bead/cell is its own tiny universe over which the titan presides (although its finite scope is a source of frustration to the once powerful but now trapped titan) <br />
I made each bead conform to a theme related to the titan. E.g. if it holds a deposed archo-elemental from the Plane of Ice, each interior layer of the bead get progressively colder and more brutal arctic conditions. A titan of gravity might lay traps that fling visitors to the roof and then in random directions.<br />
In this way, each cell is like a small demiplane that gets more and more intense and dangerous as one approaches the center. <br />
With each layer/inner bead one traverses, it becomes harder and harder to escape without the permission of the cruel titan. But he fact that the titan can only grant freedom to others makes them even more bitter and less likely to accomodate a visiting mortal.</p>

<p>Another big change I made was to make kytons the loyal servants of the jailor god (as I thought beings wrapped in chains seemed like good jailors). I had those kytons found in Baator to be rebels that were outcast from Carceri - I liked this as the kytons and the giant chains of Jangling Hiter suggest some potential link or possible future adventure involving a conflict between the loyal kytons and the rebel kytons). The loyal kytons are dathly silent (as opposed to the laughing ones of Baator). They merge into and out the giant chains that hold the beads in place. They arrive and take actions (dabus-like) to re-enforce the binds that hold the captive.</p>

<p>For conflict within the plane, I had each bead (maybe not all but many of them) have a small groups of worshippers that reamain loyal to their deposed masters. They either seek <br />
1) ways to free their captive patron<br />
2) ways to punish those who imprisoned him<br />
3) wage war against the cults of other neighboring titans</p>

<p>For reasons for PCs to visit, the titans might have knowledge of things that were never made known to the current gods. Perhaps the PCs need to get this information. (And good luck if they were sent by Zeus to get the info and the titan finds out)<br />
Maybe the cultists have stolen something that might free a dangerous titan. (Perhaps Prometheus warns the PCs as the stolen item was what allowed him to escape)</p>

<p>So for me, this is the plane of frustrated evil. All the bitterness and petty behavior results from their inability to make any meaningful changes in their lives.<br />
The fact that the nature of the imprisonment is vague frustrates any dreams of finding a means to outmanuever their jailor.<br />
I have lots of themes tied to Kafka and the classic TV series "The Prisoner"</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I think the unique representative species should not be a requirement. We developed Arcadia and Bytopia both without any sort of exemplar and I think they turned out just fine. In fact, I think trying to come up with one would be trying to fit a square peg into a round hole.</p>

<p>I believe if it feels natural to add one during the course of development (as it did with Gehenna and the pre-existing barghests) then we add one. Otherwise, don't try and force one in.</p>

<p>Unique terrain may also not really be necessary. Honestly, the physical properties of the plane are usually of least concern. Ysgard may be the exception to that rule for me. But I feel the issues the PRP deals with are usually more conceptual than concrete. Plus, each plane (especially the Inner Planes) usually has its own unique physical properties already. I think by and large these properties do all right to define the plane. Like the way nature proceeds in a very ordered and meticulous way on Arcadia, but on Arborea nature is very big and dramatic.</p>

<p>Unique overall theme is good. My biggest problem with Ysgard and to a lesser extent, Arborea, is that each layer just seems to stand by itself rather than be a part of a whole. If each individual Outer Plane is supposed to represent some kind of moral and ethical philosophy, it seems to me that each layer should somehow be tied to the larger overarching philosophy.</p>

<p>Reasons for PCs to visit is also good, though not of pre-eminent importance. I think the conflict within the plane should be the more important factor. If we build that, then players will come. For example, IIRC we didn't give Arcadia a particularly important reason directed specifically at PCs. We did, however, make it a more alive place so if PCs go there, there's something to do.</p>

<p>Philosophical opposites I think will come as we develop. Neither Arcadia nor Bytopia were developed with opposites particularly in mind. I think Gehenna is the first time this idea was brought up by rip. It worked for Gehenna and works for Acheron, but may not necessarily be a major point of contention.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Yeah, Acheron DEFINITELY needs work.  It's just one step above Bytopia as far as being fleshed out.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">I think the unique representative species should not be a requirement. We developed Arcadia and Bytopia both without any sort of exemplar and I think they turned out just fine.</span></p>

<p>I strongly disagree with you here for the Outer Planes.<br />
Also, Arcadia has the Formians.  </p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Reasons for PCs to visit is also good, though not of pre-eminent importance. I think the conflict within the plane should be the more important factor. If we build that, then players will come.</span></p>

<p>Disagree here.  No matter of conflict can convince the PCs to visit Carceri save "The DM says so".</p>

<p>On a different note, I should mention my plans and personal visions of the Inner Planes.  This is not a mere self-advertisement.  Remember that my version of the Renovation Project includes both crunch and fluff, though for planes other than Ice, it's a bit heavier on the crunch.  I should mention that ever since I posted some updated elemental hazards from Inner Planes, my Brainstorm topic has been getting a lot more hits, so evidently someone thinks the crunch is important (probably off-site folks and lurkers) </p>

<p>--I introduced the optional rule of creole languages.  A creole language is one that combines two or more languages.  In the case of the Inner Planes, each paraelemental and quasielemental plane speaks a creole language.  I also introduced two new languages: vivacian and entropian, for Positive and Negative energy.  On a similar note, I strongly believe that there should be Axian and Anarchian languages-- it would be up to the DM whether or not this replaces any creatures' existing languages on the planes (though certainly Slaadi and Windblades should speak Anarchian instead of Abyssal)</p>

<p>--I can't remember if I ever hinted at this or not, but I picture the societies of the elementals on most of the negative quasielemental planes (save for salt) as being more primitive and less developed than those on the other elemental/paraelemental/quasielemental planes.  This is particularly true for Dust and Vacuum, who do not have an official written language.</p>

<p>--A description of religion and quasi-religion among the Elementals and even outsiders of the Elemental planes.  I believe that most of the Lower Planar races hold similar views, though in their case it truly would be quasi-religious rather than actual religion (basically, they revere their home plane.  No matter how an outsider is birthed, the fact remains that it is the plane's essence that created them.  It doesn't matter whether they were created naturally or artificially via petitioners, born through sexual union, born though asexual reproduction, or were born spontaneously from the essence of the plane.  Though I should similarly mention that likewise, I cannot envision a half fiend being born to a good-aligned mother on the Prime.  The fetus, being both a physical and spiritual being, needs evil essence to nurture it, and a good or even neutrally-aligned woman doesn't have enough of it.  The Book of Vile Darkness mentions that fiends rape mortal women in order to produce half-fiendish spawn, but I simply cannot fathom this working unless the victim is of evil alignment and whatever other alignment properties the fiend is *e.g. lawful for half-baatezu*).<br />
That reminds me, I might some day work on making half-celestials and half-fiends that better reflect their parentage rather than some blanket catch-all planetouched race.  For instance, Aasimar or half-celestial creatures born from a union involving an Archon shouldn't have any energy resistances.  Luckily there already are several planetouched descendant races for celestials by race, such as Celadrin.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>I think this is what made Arcadia work well.  In canon, the layers of Arcadia were virtually identical except for some individual locations.  Post-renovation, Arcadia's first layer was turned into a plane of orderly conflict between governments of different ideologies, and the second layer became the place of peaceable conflicts.  So, when we proceed with the renovation, we should keep an eye towards making each layer of a plane be reflective of some aspect of the overall qualities of the plane.  When we come across a plane whose layers are virtually identical, thematically, it's probably a sign that it needs to be renovated.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

          Re: Planar Renovation Project        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Philosophical opposites are no problem. Each plane already fits perfectly into this scheme. Except for the four "cardinal" planes of Law, Chaos, Good, and Evil, every plane has both two mirror opposites, or equivalents across the moral or ethical axis, and a diametric opposite, creating four groups of four.</p>

<p>The first group I'll consider is Pandemonium, Acheron, Ysgard, and Arcadia. </p>

<p>Arcadia and Pandemonium are diametric opposites. Arcadia is accord and Pandemonium is discord or, to put it another way, harmony and dissonance, or still another way euphony and cacophony. In Arcadia, all strives toward agreement, each element harmonious with the rest. Arcadia is a vast song where everything is in key, each note working with the others to create a greater whole (this isn't to say it's a single united government, or that Arcadia's governments can't disagree with one another, only that this is the plane's basic theme). Pandemonium is a broken and shattered symphony, a shrieking cacophany where every note is wrong and twisted, disordered and in conflict with the rest. Arcadia is disturbingly sane, its inhabitants filled with a clarity of purpose that seems eerie to prime observers. Pandemoniacs are mad, their minds discordant and broken, a jazz solo gone wrong. In Arcadia harmony is the highest form of Good, and in Pandemonium discord is the only meaning, harmony a blasphemous lie invented to torment the insane. Arcadians see Pandemoniacs as the worst thing in the multiverse, the original disease that begat all others (even the Abyss is a comparatively harmonious place, even Limbo comparatively healthy and sane), and Pandemoniacs see Arcadians as the original and cruelest lie.</p>

<p>Arcadia and Acheron are trans-axial equivalents (this being the good-evil axis in this case). Arcadia is harmony and Acheron is conformity. Arcadia is righteous order and Acheron is unrighteous order. Where Arcadia is united for the greater good, its individuality sacrificed in favor of a great composition, Acheron's individuality is beaten down brutally, stripped from its victims for the sake of stripping them down. Harmony is the reward offered to Arcadia's souls in exchange for the loss of personal volition. Acheron is Arcadia with no reward, where the loss of individuality is its own reward. Acheron is the home not just of faceless grunts eternally battling for causes they've forgotten, but of every bureaucrat, toady, lickspittle, and thrall who has allowed duty to come before judgment. Acheron is Arcadia seen through a looking glass darkly. Acheron is Arcadia without the point. Arcadia is Acheron with a cause worth fighting for.</p>

<p>Arcadia and Ysgard are trans-axial equivalents, and in this case the axis is the Law-Chaos one. Where Arcadia is the home of those who have surrendered their individuality for the sake of their cause, Ysgard is the home of those who embrace their individuality for the same reason. If Arcadia is harmony, Ysgard is individualism. Where Arcadia's warriors bunch together in tight phalanxes, its formians in massive hives, in Ysgard the warriors fight as proud individuals and berserk rogues. Arcadia's artists and musicians compose propaganda pieces for the glory of the state, while in Ysgard the poet's inspiration comes from the lonely places, sacred wells and god-granted drafts of mead, solitary sojourns into the realm of the moon, howling out pure kennings in defiance of gods, giants, elves and men. </p>

<p>Pandemonium and Acheron are trans-axial opposites, Pandemonium's discord mirroring Acheron's diseased, obsessive-compulsive brand of order. Where Pandemonium is a plane of wild, individual madness, Acheron is the madness of crowds, the mob-mind assaulting the individual conscience and drowning it out because to the mob, conformity is the only morality that matters.</p>

<p>Acheron and Ysgard, then, are antitheses as well. As with its opposite Arcadia, Ysgard is a place where fighters remember why they're fighting. They have a goal in mind, whether it's to destroy the giants at the end of time or something more immediate. Acheron is the plane of lost causes, where fighting is the only purpose of fighting. Where Acheron is essentially a hollowed-out Arcadia, it is the complete opposite of everything Ysgard stands for. In Acheron, conformity is the only purpose. In Ysgard, individuality is the highest purpose. Acheron is the opposite of Ysgard in every respect that Arcadia was, with the additional lack of the one thing Ysgard and Arcadia have in common: good intentions. Ysgard holds an extreme view of Good that upholds personal volition as the greatest virtue, so for them Limbo is more moral than Elysium. Acheron holds personal volition as the greatest evil, the worst of crimes, and their ideal of conformity is such that even Baator falls short as a bunch of roguish scoff-laws, far too permissive for their own good. So it is that Acheron and Ysgard see one another as personifications of all that is wrong and broken in the multiverse, the darkest of evils: individuality and conformity, twin sins.</p>

<p>Ysgard and Pandemonium are mirror images along the good-evil axis. Ysgard is inspiration and creativity, the wellspring of poets, the base of the Infinite Staircase that stretches to every plane where art and imagination exist. Ysgard is the native plane of the lillends, and it's the plane where all warriors are poets and berserk fury is equated with enlightenment. Ysgard is also the home of some of the multiverse's greatest smiths and artisans, and the inspiration of the smiths among the dwarves and elves of Nidvellir is just as joyously individual as that of the warriors. Ysgard is, perhaps, the outer plane that's closest to the idea of creation. Muspelheim is the primal spark, the first flame, the creative spirit that drew forth the frozen potential of Niflheim and allowed movement and life to exist. The giants of Muspelheim are the guardians of that spark and raw as they are, wild as they are, their purpose is to protect the fires of creation from every threat, including the gods who stole it. But I digress. Having established that Ysgard is creativity, Pandemonium is creativity as well, but gone wrong. Pandemonium is just as wild and imaginative as Ysgard, but it represents the dark side of the imagination, the dream become nightmare. The line between genius and madness is thin, and perhaps that line is called Limbo. The genius and inspiration of Ysgard is reflected in the tangled fever-dreams of Pandemonium's depths, Ysgard's independent eccentrics becoming Pandemonium's lonely madmen. They are not so far apart, really. As with Arcadia and Acheron, Pandemonium <span style="font-style:italic">is</span> Ysgard, but with the purpose drained out and made hollow. The same motions are performed in Pandemonium as in Ysgard, but the meaning is lost. In Pandemonium they wander in the darkness, futilely trying to do what Ysgardians do, but everything they touch going askew.</p>

<p>The second group of four is Gehenna, Carceri, Bytopia, and the Beastlands. While the first group we considered represented different sides of conformity, creativity, madness, and harmony, this four represents different sides of nature and partnership.</p>

<p>Gehenna and Carceri are mirror images along the law-chaos axis. Gehenna is exploitation and Carceri is treachery, and these are two,  equally evil solutions to the problem of how any two or more people should deal with competing interests.. In Carceri, the solution is to create an alliance and then break it as soon as it is convenient. The prisoners of Carceri strive eternally to escape the prison their disloyalties create, aware that cooperation is essential for success but too selfish and independent to maintain this in a plane that forces them to choose between their own well-being and that of their partners. Gehenna is more orderly, and relationships can be preserved there, but their own solution is to subjugate their associates permanently, so one is forced to serve the other's interests at the expense of their own. Carceri is what Gehenna would be if it was too chaotic to maintain its social structures. Gehenna is what Carceri would be if it was orderly enough that its relationships didn't constantly fall apart.</p>

<p>Carceri and Bytopia are antitheses. Carceri is a mockery of everything that Bytopia stands for, and Bytopia mocks Carceri by being everything it fails to achieve. Bytopia is community, industry, symbiosis. It is complementary strengths. It is mutually advantageous partnership. Carceri creates mockeries of all these things only to forever betray them. There can be no betrayal without trust, so Carcerians continually build up trust only to shatter it, time and again, hollow mockeries of what works so well in Bytopia. To Bytopians cooperation is the highest good, so trust is essential. Nothing defines Carcerians more than the violation of trust, and so to Bytopians, Carceri is the worst of all evil.</p>

<p>Bytopia and the Beastlands are mirror opposites, reverse-twins seen across the law-chaos line. Where cooperation is key in everything Bytopians do, Beastlanders are independent, free. In Bytopia, a hunter and a farmer combine their advantages. In the Beastlands, they ignore each other, or may even eat each other. The freedom of the Beastlands isn't like the radical libertarianism of Ysgard, or even like the libertines of Arborea. Beastlanders aren't concerned with Chaos as the highest form of good; they're just too wild to cooperate effectively. They compete instead, predators striving for the same prey, prey striving to evade predators. In Bytopia connections are made between disparate communities through trade; in the Beastlands, the biggest social unit is a small pack or herd. Not everyone in the Beastlands is an animal, necessarily, but the same ethos of independence and competition holds true across species, from the sages and scholars in the realms of Deneir and Zivilyn to the winged elves of Ilifar-in-the-Wind. Bytopia is cultivated nature acting in harmony with the wild. In the Beastlands, the wild competes with cultivation, constantly encroaching and seeking to swallow it up. Everything competes in the Beastlands in a Darwinian struggle. In Bytopia, everything cooperates instead. The two planes aren't that far apart, but their approaches are opposite.</p>

<p>Gehenna and the Beastlands are diametric opposites. While the Beastlands is everything wild and lush and fertile and alive, in Gehenna everything is exploited and stripped and used up and dead, with nothing remaining. The highest concern in the Beastlands, besides the independence and freedom of the wild, is renewal and conservation. Nothing is taken unless it can be replaced. The sick and weak are weeded out so that the health of the species is improved in the Beastlands, while the healthy and strong are left alone. In Gehenna the sick and weak are preserved because they're easy to manipulate, while the healthy and strong are either made weak or destroyed as a potential rival or threat. The Beastlands is wild freedom and independence from social constraints, a place where one's inner nature shines forth. Gehenna is oppression and domination, where inner natures are forcibly suppressed from without or deliberately hidden, for secrets are power and Gehennans must remain constantly alert lest their enemies see their hidden weaknesses. In Gehenna, Beastlanders see the death of all they hold dear. In the Beastlands, Gehennans see the kind of weakness that, in their own plane, would mean their death or enslavement. Gehennans often refer to the Beastlands as the Plane of the Weak, the personification of every flaw they seek to suppress. In the Beastlands, they see their own deaths looking back at them, for in Gehenna, one's true self is one's weakness is one's destruction. The Beastlands fill them with envy, disgust, and terror all at the same time. No plane is as honest as the Beastlands, and nothing threatens Gehennans more than honesty.</p>

<p>The Beastlands and Carceri are parallels. Both are equally wild, equally untamed, equally concerned with independence and the embrace of the wild aspects of their natures. Carceri is Nature at its most savage and cruel, and the Beastlands is Nature at its most benevolent and wise. The Beastlands is one's true self at its most noble, and Carceri is one's true self at its most corrupt. In the Beastlands, predator and prey compete honestly; while they might take advantage of camouflage and stealth, they do not try to hide what they are, and they do not try to build relationships they don't intend to honor. They avoid Bytopia's path entirely in the Beastlands, while in Carceri they imitate Bytopia only to mock and dishonor it. Carceri is no more capable of maintaining structure than the Beastlands are, but Carceri pretends an order it does not, cannot possess.</p>

<p>And Gehenna and Bytopia are similar parallels, exploitation the malevolent equivalent of cooperation, Gehenna's degrading trade a dark reflection of Bytopia's uplifting trade, Gehenna's slave labor reflecting Bytopia's proud tradesfolk.</p>

<p>The other groups of four are the cardinal alignment planes: the "corner planes" of the Abyss, Celestia, Arborea, and Baator, and the pure planes of Law, Chaos, Good, and Evil: Mechanus, Limbo, Elysium, and the Waste. The ways in which these planes oppose one another are more obvious. The Abyss is injustice, atrocity, and sin, while Mount Celestia is justice, mercy, and virtue. Baator is tyranny and Arborea is freedom. The Waste is as depressing and cruel as Elysium is vibrant and kind. Limbo is as chaotic as Mechanus is orderly. Baator is as lawful as Celestia, and Arborea's passions are as chaotic as the darker passions of the Abyss. Baator is a sinkhole, a pit leading to further depths of corruption just as Celestia leads ever upward toward enlightenment. Baator's punishments are a hollow reflection of Celestia's merciful justice. The Abyss's debauchery is a hollow reflection of Arborea's rapturous pleasures. The Abyss is passion and hate, and Arborea is passion and love. Arborea is freedom-fighting and Baator is endless slavery to an eternal tyrant. Celestia and Arborea disagree fervently over the nature of Good and the importance of freedom versus the importance of public order. Baator and the Abyss are at war. Celestia views Arborea as a plane of sad and corruptive sinners as divorced from true Good as Baator is, and Arborea in turn thinks Celestia is as wrong-headed as the Abyss, seeing Celestians as a plane full of self-righteous fascists. </p>

<p>And in the middle of it all, reconciling and synthesizing all the different opposites, is the Outlands. Between love and hate, between liberty and tyranny, between responsible competition and exploitation, between trust and betrayal, between corruption and purification, between concord and discord, between order and senselessness, between hope and despair, between conformity and individualism, between tyranny and anarchy,  between justice and liberty lies the contradictory, complementary, paradoxical Land, a place of contrasts and opposites and also a place where the vibrant colors of the extreme planes blur together to form neutral tones, grays and browns that make the spots of color all the more shocking.</p>

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>In my rush to get my ideas out there, I may have muddied the waters a bit. When revamping an outer plane, I RECOMMEND considering the following:</p>

<p>REQUIRED<br />
*Unique overall theme(s)</p>

<p>DESIRABLE<br />
*Conflict within the plane - e.g. on Arcadia (after renovation) we had the different groups with their different plans to achieve Utopia in conflict with each other<br />
This doesn't have to be an all out war; just a difference of opinion on the main theme of the plane. This provides internal adventure seeds that aren't on the level of "save the multiverse...again"<br />
*Unique terrain<br />
*At least one unique representative species (prefereably one that embodies one or more themes of the plane)<br />
*Reason(s) for PCs to visit<br />
Sure we can always fall back on the standard themes<br />
   -Stop the (evil) plot<br />
   -Assist the injured or desperate (good) being<br />
   -Rescue the (good) individual from the (evil) plane<br />
   -Drive the (evil) intruder from the (good) plane<br />
   -Resolve conflict between residents of the (good) plane<br />
   -Get information from resident<br />
   -Get the item (often randomly placed) there<br />
But I also try (often unsuccessfully) to give the PCs a reason to visit (e.g. they want to experience the famous gambling dens of Gehenna, they want to get their future told by the Norns, etc.). <br />
Sometimes this is tough (e.g. aside from being suicidal, I can't think of many reasons to be a tourist in the Abyss - I'm sure there are some reasons, but not many)</p>

<p>USEFUL TOOLS TO DEFINE A PLANE<br />
*Philosophical opposite(s) - I included this because I often get inspiration for a vaguely defined plane when I have a clear picture of what its opposing plane(s) represent<br />
See VanWormer's notes above as he did a great job of giving concrete examples.</p>

<p>So back to the question, who gets the next make-over? I hear some support for Acheron, Carceri and maybe Pandemonium.<br />
Is there any way to turn this into a poll so people can vote? (Beyond my expertise)</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Of the three, Acheron needs it the worst.  </p>

<p>Pandaemonium IMO doesn't need it that much-- sure, there isn't much there, but there are innumerable adventure seeds to stop the mad mage/fiend/what have you from unsealing the forbidden artifact or elder evil from the walls of the third layer.</p>

<p>When I said that Carceri suffers from "Ooze Syndrome", I mean that there's nothing there to justify the risks and horrors of entering it.  Teleportation and plane-shifting magic simply doesn't work here, meaning that barring an interplanar portal (and portals tend to be a lot rarer the deeper into a plane you go), the PCs will have to reach the central sphere and leave Carceri the old-fashioned way.  So prettymuch there are only two ways the PCs are going to end-up here: a 1-way portal into the plane due to either an accident or a pissed off power, or because the DM has dragged the PCs kicking and screaming into the plane (hey, the cleric or mage should know SOMETHING about Carceri.  The DM is an ass if he doesn't give the players some idea of what they're getting into.)</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Well, all I can say is that if you want it to happen; you should start a new thread.</p>

<p>I've started a couple. Admittedly, the ones I started didn't peter out as well as the early ones for Arcadia and Bytopia did (in these earlier cases, there did seem to be a general concensus on the renovation)<br />
All I would say is start with an overview of the status quo; then add a follow-up with some of the non-canonical ideas you might have for the renovation.</p>

<p>While almost all the Inner Planes could use a renovation, a lot of the remaining Outer Planes may need more of a fleshing out. Arcadia and Bytopia were bland to the point of being repellent. By contrast, I think most everyone likes the Grey Wastes as the realm of the gods of death and the uppermost battlefield. But a few people have expressed that the lands of the dead could use some more color (no pun intended, since I'm talking about the Wastes) and sites of interest. If one were to journey into Hel's realm, what would one see through the fog?</p>

<p>Whatever you decide to tackle, all I can say is don't be disappointed if it doesn't congeal. There are a lot of planes where people have strong personal preferences. I'd just ask everyone to be open to the ideas of various contributers even if it doesn't mesh with your vision.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><span style="font-style:italic">That may be, but what reason do the PCs have to go there?</span></p>

<p>Pretty sure there are resources indigenous only to Elysium that might come in handy for the PCs.  Granted, most of these can probably be bought in the Great Bazaar, but still.</p>

<p>Since Elysium is the plane of pure, undiluted good, it makes sense that it would be the place PCs would go to destroy an artifact of great evil.  Or at the very least, seek help/advice in its destruction.<br />
This, of course, would require a party diplomat and some planning, since the natives and powers won't be keen on a group of mortals waltzing in with a major artifact of ineffable evil.<br />
Likewise, Mechanus and Limbo are perfect destinations for the destruction of a powerful chaotic or lawful artifact.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Don't forget that that layer is also the origin of the quesar. Belieren has always, to me, been the layer of self-sacrifice; a significant chunk of the plane of purest good deliberately sullied to protect the rest of the multiverse. There's plenty to build upon on that theme; martyrs who absorb the pains of others, literal chunks of other planes squirreled away in the swamps, holdovers from the early days before the planes took their present shape.</p>

<p>The prisoner(s) of Belieren are not necessarily evil, however. Just dangerous. Belieren is the where the deepest, darkest secrets of the guardinals are squirreled away; not necessarily things that make the guardinals look bad (although there's probably some of that) but also sensitive things that they don't want others to know. The quesar do make their creators look bad, though their creators aren't guardinals. The aasimon who made the quesar were driven out of Elysium, but I don't think they'd be welcome back in Mount Celestia, so I imagine they have a city in Bytopia where they continue to experiment in the creation of living celestial constructs; upper planar warforged, distant cousins of the quesar of Elysium.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>Har Megidon</em> wrote:</div>I'd say Vacuum. The whole "void" idea is already taken by the Negative, which at least puts in some things. A plane of absolute nothing should be totally changed.</div></p>

<p>There is, paradoxically, stuff in Vacuum, which I find amusing.  (My air genasi wizard has actually researched some spells and Guvner loopholes relating to the plane, but that's a side story.)</p>

<p>However, if you want to change it, I can see a certain distaste for having negative Air be nothingness -- after all, why isn't that true for all the rest of the elements?  So here's a fix which might require a little work, but which maybe makes things a little more symmetrical.</p>

<p>Move Vacuum to be a region in each of the negative quasielemental planes, the region of absolute zero nothingness just before the Multiverse goes, horribly, <span style="font-style:italic">past</span> nothing and in to the anti-life existence of the Negative.  Allow the Vacuum creatures like egarus to live in all of these regions (with lots of planar paths -- after all, how could you even tell when you had gone from one a vacuum of one element to a vacuum of another?).</p>

<p>Replace Vacuum with Smoke as the negative Air quasielemental.  As you head Negative from Air, breathing becomes harder.  The air becomes stale, polluted, and devitalized.  The glow slowly fades, and visibility is limited.  In core Smoke there's plenty of air, but it doesn't support any creature that has to breathe.  Further Negative, the air pressure itself starts decreasing toward zero.</p>

<p>The next part is what might make reshuffling some of the native creatures' spell, spell-likes, and resistances a bit tricky.</p>

<p>Replace Smoke with Lightning as the Fire/Air paraelemental.  Replace Lightning as the positive Air quasielemental with the Plane of Thunder.  If you leave various powers and resistances alone, everything is fine, though efreet might mock djinn about it.  If you replace most resistances to electricity with resistances to sonic attacks, and a lot of electric powers with sonic, thing might get a little complicated but hopefully wouldn't be too much out of balance.  Air being opposed to Earth, sonic effects as positive Air make a lot of sense.</p>

<p>The Plane of Thunder would be something like this:</p>

<p>Going Positive from Air, the winds get more active, until you come to a plane where hurricanes and tornados rip across the endless sky.  Whipcrack wavefronts of sonic booms hurtle invisibly from one art of the plane to another, sometimes expoding outward from a point for no visible reason, sometimes banging together or even collapsing inward on a brief moment of intense pressure that creates <span style="font-style:italic">sonic jewels</span>, air crystallized in the form of a sound node.  Endless thunder shakes the atoms of everything in the plane; all objects not protected against sonic damage suffer 1d10-1 points per round, and living creatures with less than 5 points of sonic resistance must make Fort saves against deafness.</p>

<p>In addition to gyre mephits (from dust devils up to tornados) and invisible sound quasielementals, living songs roam the plane, which adventurous bards seek for magical effects, some paying with their hearing.  There are places here where you can hear anything you want to hear, and you will.  Floating effects of <span style="font-style:italic">holy word</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">blasphemy</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">dictum</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">word of chaos</span> drown out the other effects of the plane and are inhabited by beings of alignments that find them comfortable.  Words equal in power but having nothing to do with alignments have been discovered here, like <span style="font-style:italic">word of ransom</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">nickname</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">bon mot</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">mot juste</span>.  Ecumenical outposts of a surprising variety of religions feature mystics who believe that within the sound of the Thousand Thunders one can hear the voice that spoke Creation, or the words that Reality is telling us now, or the secret knowledge that makes gods.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">
