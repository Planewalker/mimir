         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>Hyena of Ice</em> wrote:</div><span style="font-style:italic">You are correct. Arcadia was the first one, IIRC, and it was very thoroughly done. Bytopia was the second and also got good treatment.</span></p>

<p>Really?  Because all I saw in either topic was discussion of canon, themes, and ideas.  Nothing was ever implemented as far as rules.  Honestly, it does little good to describe new locations, monsters, and regions if you don't explain how this affects gameplay mechanics.  Come to think of it, I do recall new monsters here and there, but not very many.</div></p>

<p>The purpose of these renovations isn't to create rules and locations and mechanics. Rather, it's to expand the framework the setting is built on.</p>

<p>Mechanics are not everything. One might argue this is especially true in Planescape. We built on the framework and provided more areas for people to expand upon it. If you want mechanics so bad, go make them for yourself. It's more constructive to these discussions to build on the concepts and let people fill in the blanks as they need to. Mechanics are completely auxiliary and unnecessary to the development of a strong, solid setting.</p>

<p>Arcadia and Bytopia were very well renovated with the themes broadened and made more accessible.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

          Re: Planar Renovation Project: The Positive Energy Plane        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><span style="font-style:italic">Same for Inner Planes, which didn't even have monsters.</span></p>

<p>Incorrect.  The Inner Planes book gives rules for travel in each plane, as well as the effects that most hazards cause, and the ability modifiers for avoiding certain hazards.  It most certainly isn't complete; there are no rules for Eternal Ice anywhere in the Planescape books, nor for Vividium, and rules are not listed for several locations.<br />
That's still far more complete than most of the renovation projects, here.<br />
If you want examples, then let's look at the elemental plane of fire:<br />
--Rules for vision<br />
--Damage to characters and equipment from heat, including a chart that shows damage by AC.  This chart is the basis for the damage caused by the plane and "Burning Heat" (in Sandstorm), which is taken from the mid-level ACs on the chart (3d10 to be exact).  Likewise, the damage from cold on the Paraelemental Plane of Ice is the basis for Unearthly Cold and general cold damage in 3x.<br />
--The effects of toxic gases on the characters<br />
--New hazards and rules for them, such as Shadowfire<br />
--Details on the effects on magic that are not included in the Planar magic effects charts.</p>

<p>As a better example (and more familiar to me), let's look at Paraelemental Ice.<br />
--Rules for movement<br />
--Rules for vision<br />
--Rules for cold damage<br />
--Expanded details on magical effects not listed in the Planar magic effects chart (i.e. fire, heat, and flame effects deal only half damage, cold spells are useless)<br />
--References to hazards detailed in the DMG (such as winds, steep slopes, and icy surfaces)<br />
--Hazards, such as thin ice and crevasses.  The rules for true cold sadly are not complete, as it does not tell us how much damage unprotected idiots suffer within it, nor does it give the rules for the freezing of abstract concepts (though presumably the sufferer would have to make a Wis or Con save every hour or whatever or suffer permanent ability damage.  I've yet to figure how to deal with the mechanics of this for 3.5 rules without making them as difficult and deadly as 1-2E rules.)</p>

<p>You have a point on the Planewalker's Handbook and Planescape Box, however (with the exception of Sigil).</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Mechanics are not everything. One might argue this is especially true in Planescape. We built on the framework and provided more areas for people to expand upon it. If you want mechanics so bad, go make them for yourself.</span><br />
I do.  You would know this quite well if you read through the convoluted mess that is my Paraplane of Ice renovation topic <br />
The topic is actually meant as a rough draft of sorts-- eventually I hope to organize the entire thing into an RTF file (I've never made a PDF file and lack any licnesed software for making them; I'd have to download a 30 day trial program in order to make one, so I'm hoping rather that, once I make the RTF, that I can ask someone here to make the PDF version for me.  This may not be necessary, however, since I think both PCs and Macs can read RTF files now, and I have no plan for the time being of including any art.)<br />
In fact, I should edit the opening post right now to list what the topic has thus far, and what I plan to have.</p>

<p>I also have a topic (the "Brainstorm" one) where I am expanding upon and converting ideas and mechanics from 2E and 3.5.  <br />
Though it will be exceedingly difficult, eventually I plan to make an event chart for travel on the elemental, paraelemental, and quasielemental planes.  The encounter chart includes "nothing", "false alarm", and encounter charts for hazards, outposts (caravans, nomads, villages, towns) and monsters (classic encounter chart).  Sadly, half-assed attempts thus far to make such a chart have failed, partly because there are just too many monsters for some planes.<br />
Also, some people might find the charts too complicated/too many die rolls. The first table would be a D6 to determine the type of encounter.  My intention after that was to use a percentile roll based on the encounter, with a third D20 table for rare encounters on the monster table, but there are too many monsters for either table. (I had no intention of writing out the encounter tables for each plane, just a general guideline).  Also, I couldn't figure out a way to scale the appropriate rate of one type of encounter to another using a mere D6 roll.<br />
My intention for such a convoluted chart is that it would be used INSTEAD of attempting to flesh out every location/etc. on an inner plane, which would be ludicrous to attempt, anbd the chart's framework could also be used for some outer planes as well.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Hmm...this might be where the disconnect lies.  A full-on revision like what you're talking about was outside the stated scope of the renovation project, which was almost entirely concerned with the fluff.  Really, the focus was on making those planes which had weak premises in canon - mostly the Upper Planes, but also some of the Inner Planes like Ooze or Vacuum - and making them more viable as adventuring locales.  The rule mechanics for each plane, wherever we could, would be preserved.  Likewise, as far as I know, there were no plans to distill the development down into a PDF, RTF or whatever (though, thinking about it, it would make sense to try and preserve what we've come up with somewhere outside of just a thread).</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Some of the planes (both outer and inner) are severely lacking in bestiary and other things, though.  This is most evident in my latest (I think) post in the Inner Planes Resource index, where the list for bestiary on Paraelemental Ice is about 5x longer than that for Paraelemental Magma, even though 2E sourcebooks state that the latter has more life and diversity on it (the problem, of course, is that Paraelemental Ice represents an entire damage type and monster subtype, though strangely this rule does not help Quasielemental Lightning...).  Another example (same topic) is the list of negative native monsters as opposed to positive ones, even when you subtract the 'nilla non-indigenous undead out of the picture.<br />
However, this has been a problem since 1E, and Inner Planes even made a half-assed attempt to justify exactly this (claiming that Positive Energy is more hostile than Negative Energy, somehow)  However, even with such a rule in mind, there are not enough positive-indigenous OR positive-loving monsters, which IIRC is only around 1/3rd the number of negative monsters minus the non-indigenous undead.</p>

<p>For outer planes, Bytopia springs to mind as one with a severe lack in indigenous bestiary.  In fact, to get an idea on which planes are short on bestiary, one need only look at my Outer Planes Resource index (which reminds me, I need to update the list soon.  Too bad the notes I took for that are scattered throughout various .word files...)</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>Wicke</em> wrote:</div><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>Hyena of Ice</em> wrote:</div>Also, I always assumed that the purpose of the Planar Renovation projects was to eventually hash out a 3.5 conversion of all the locations and stuff located in the Planes of Law, Planes of Chaos, and Planes of Conflict that never made it to 3x, and make it available as a PDF and RTF file on the downloads page.</div></p>

<p>Hmm...this might be where the disconnect lies.  A full-on revision like what you're talking about was outside the stated scope of the renovation project, which was almost entirely concerned with the fluff.  Really, the focus was on making those planes which had weak premises in canon - mostly the Upper Planes, but also some of the Inner Planes like Ooze or Vacuum - and making them more viable as adventuring locales.  The rule mechanics for each plane, wherever we could, would be preserved.  Likewise, as far as I know, there were no plans to distill the development down into a PDF, RTF or whatever (though, thinking about it, it would make sense to try and preserve what we've come up with somewhere outside of just a thread).</div></p>

<p>This is it in a nutshell. </p>

<p>When I put up the first project, there was <span style="font-style:italic">never</span> any intent to make anything rules-specific. I can't recall but I might've specified that I want to stay away from mechanics and focus purely on concepts and themes. The point was to build on the <span style="font-style:italic">fluff</span> that was already there and enhance it so that planes made more sense on their own and had better adventuring prospects. I still haven't seen a good reason why mechanics should be included -- especially given how many systems could potentially use Planescape now (D&amp;D 2e, 3e, 4e; there's a Mage conversion somewhere on Planewalker; Mutants and Masterminds would make a good system; Storyteller in general could be made to work; Exalted in Planescape? Could be kinda fun. Etc., etc.). Like I said, if you want the mechanics, make them for yourself but they're not essential. Feel like a plane could use some indigenous life? That's fine, but mechanics are not required or even important to building a native biosphere. Plus, not every plane actually needs indigenous life forms. But the crunch? Completely unnecessary to developing the Multiverse.</p>

<p>Also, you may recall I did stick my nose into your Project Ice thread, but I gave up after nearly every idea I came up with was shot down instantly because it didn't adhere exactly specifically to what you claim is canon.</p>

<p>I considered making a more permanent location for the fluff we built during the Renovation but I eventually abandoned that idea. I was thinking more along the lines of a website that had everything we settled on written in a more concise fashion -- but never really planned on something so organized as a PDF or RTF. Needless to say, the consideration was never a huge one.</p>

<p>The strength of Planescape doesn't lie in the mechanical aspects, but in the settiing. Quite frankly, the mechanics are not that important and Planescape would still very much be Planescape if you took the mechanics out of the equation entirely.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><span style="font-style:italic">Quite frankly, the mechanics are not that important </span><br />
I very, very strongly disagree here.  </p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Planescape would still very much be Planescape if you took the mechanics out of the equation entirely.</span><br />
Again, I disagree.  At its heart, Planescape is a 2E setting.  Take the mechanics out, and all it is is a series of beautifully written computer game rulebooks without the computer game.  Furthermore, for both 2E and 3x, the mechanics from either version serve as the building blocks for the mechanics of the other-- with a few exceptions, it's not overly difficult to convert 2E to 3E (except for monsters) or 3E to 2E (except for converting skill checks to ability modifiers) if you know what you're doing.  It's just a lot of work depending on how much you want to convert.  This is particularly true for the damage formulas-- most of them are either the same or strongly based off of one another.  The only exception I can think of off my head is the damage suffered in Cania in the Fiendish Codex II, which is a whopping ridiculous 10d6 cold damage per minute, as opposed to 1d6 per round in 2E Planescape (which is the same damage you'd take on Paraelemental Ice.)</p>

<p>Though I agree that Planescape is stronger in the fluff aspects, the mechanics aspects are still important.  Otherwise, if what you claim were true, we would not have that 6 chapter 3.5 Planescape campaign guide + two bestiaries on the download page, you know.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Also, you may recall I did stick my nose into your Project Ice thread, but I gave up after nearly every idea I came up with was shot down instantly because it didn't adhere exactly specifically to what you claim is canon.</span><br />
Yeah, I admit I have a rather narrow view of that.  Partly because I have trouble accepting the idea of abstract themes for the inner planes, since in my mind you're then limiting all planar natives and even inhabitants to those personality traits.  Though since working on the Ice Renovation project, I have indeed noticed extant themes among the indigenous creatures and the archomentals of both Ice and other inner planes, as well.<br />
So I'd probably go with 'tendencies' rather than 'traits' for the inner planes.<br />
I suppose it doesn't help that my high functioning autism causes me to get stuck on details while being unable to see the big picture-- or keep things simple. I'm a details freak, obsessive-compulsive style, so to me, EVERYTHING has to be meticulously detailed with all the bases covered.  So I guess I simply don't get the purpose of just re-summarizing the fluff of the plane.  It just seems so incredibly half-assed to me (I mean no offense by that, it just seems to me like something that is 90% devoid of effort.  I mean, what's the point without the details?  To me it rings of plenty of 2E and even 3.0 entries, for instance several skill expansion entries throughout the 3.0 books *such as Sword and Fist* that give expanded uses for a skill, but then don't explain how to apply it-- no DCs, no example DCs, no example scenarios, etc.  A goood 2E example would be the myriad of special materials presented throughout the various books-- for example, vividium in Inner Planes.  The books basically state what the substance is and that it exists, but no mention of how much it costs, or even what kinds of effects it has when used as a special material, or even how to use it in manufacturing!  Eternal Ice was only slightly better, as the effects were given, but nothing on how durable it is against attacks was given, and unless there was something in the Sigil books, there was no price guide for eternal ice boxes, either.<br />
Planescape was hardly the only setting with this problem-- outside of Arms &amp; Equipment and possibly Volo's Guide to All Things Magical *though only for some materials* and the Dark Sun box, NONE of the 2E special materials were given rules for manufacture, and only a few materials had their special effects listed.)</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I've mostly tuned out of these planar renovation threads, because they stop talking about interesting new points on each plane we've be trying to renovate.</p>

<p>I personally think that if there's going to be lists of monsters, canon material and references to a plane they should go in an article rather than one of these threads.  Articles are where things like this should go as they are supposedly there for easier reference and searching.  Now if only the front page got updated to whatever the latest article was...</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>I've read part of the discussions above. I also agree that there be a final result of these renovation projects. When the renovation started, it started with Arcadia, because among the Outer P., it was the one that got the least loving - it had 2 layers that barely had any description, and one layer that was completely dismissed (lost). So there wasn't much fluff to begin with, so we had to come up with our own fluff for the plane. However our lengthy efforts didn't come to a conclusion. Same with Bytopia, etc... <br />
My approach for Planar Renovations would be: add more interesting "sites, cities and realms" to the plane, an/or detail existing ones.  The other things (the legend and lore, the npc races, new spells and rules) come as a direct result of this, you'll see. Like Rip's excellent work on Void's Edge (Btw, everyone should read it).<br />
 <br />
My ideas for what the Final result of Renovation projects should be:<br />
I think that, we should find a way to summarize and put to appropriate, in character version of the ideas we developed, and collect them in pdf, along with PSCS, in the spirit of  "Planes of ..." books.</p>

<p>Return to topic:<br />
I kind of like +EP as it is, while I also agree it needs some more fluff. What I like: The nonliving things coming alive with contact to positive. Creatures getting healed. Creatures getting over-loaded. Idea of natives who plan to "cleanse" the multiverse with + energy. Idea, from eralier on this thread, that the + energy grows when you move to its core(the Source).<br />
What I don't like: Souls growing on crystal trees, (in fact the entire "Bastion of Broken Dreams" needs work, to say the least)... People only come here to get healed. Those strange detached head creatures in 3.5e? For some reason I never warmed up to them. </p>

<p>So, in line with my approach, I have ideas for a few places:<br />
Hat's Shop<br />
-Located near a portal from Sigil, there is a shop, stocked entirely by reanimated items of previous visitors to +. The shopkeep are a happy trio of a talking wizard's Hat, A robe that always hovers right under the hat and functions like its body, and a long, bright red cape, that does most of the work. The Hat, a pointy, comfartable blue confection, is a great bargainer, and together with its cape and robe-body, makes a great spell slinger. He knows the ups and downs of the +, and willing to share the info with paying customers. He only takes new spells(along with spell components), which he feeds to its reanimated spellbook, as payment. There are all sorts of reanimated items in the shop, mostly mundane items. The Hat strictly only allows non speaking objects to the shop, but he can communicate with all objects telephatically. The buyers will have to find another way of communicating with the stock. There is a small chance of finding useful objects, but they have to be careful before they buy. And stay away from the pocket watch - it is ALWAYS wrong.<br />
The Dark: The Hat will not reveal this to his customers, but most of his items will return to normal living obejects sometime after they leave his shop. He doesn't care (or doesn't know) of this phenomenon, since he never left the +, and he doesn't get repeat customers, anyway.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>While the Planar Renovation threads usually end up breaking up into mild arguments at some point, they are still one of my favorite things on this site.</p>

<p>I side with the "fluff" camp as I can usually come up with game mechanics and monster stats once I’m inspired by a good idea for an adventure or location. But if I think a plane/location is uninspired; I have no incentive to think of game mechanics or monster stats (I mean, how often was anyone inspired to think of new monsters/adventures in Arcadia or Bytopia before we tweaked them? Now, I’m actually excited by these planes)<br />
So I love the ideas for themes, new sites, new ideas for monsters and new personalities on the planes. So far, I think almost all the Renovations have been very useful to me to generate new ideas for planes that I had previously found a little dull. I ignore a lot of what gets suggested but I still appreciate the creativity involved and I typically find that very helpful.</p>

<p>Since not every idea that gets thrown out is going to appeal to everyone or fit into everyone’s campaign; things are bound to get cluttered. Unless we appoint someone as an arbitrator as to what is “accepted” and “too far out there”, I think this is bound to happen. Perhaps after a few weeks of bouncing ideas around; someone can make an “official” renovation with the ideas that seemed to garner the most support and interest – but that’s additional work for somebody. <br />
For the open forums, I think the current setup is fine even if all the good ideas get put out there within the first few weeks</p>

<p>I don’t like limiting creative ideas too much. I do propose counter-arguments and alternative suggestions; but I try not to express them as mandates or insults (and my apologies to anyone who interpretted my comments that way)</p>

<p>The outer plane renovations always ignite my imagination more as they are planes about ideas. <br />
My only suggestion for a “rule” regarding renovations for the elemental planes is that while ideas and themes can be used (especially to inspire ideas); I don’t think these themes should ever limit the elements. <br />
Fire might be tied to themes or anger, to themes of passion, or to themes of purification. But ultimately, I think it should just be viewed as just the raw element. Certain citizens or locations might tie into the suggested themes; but I think that these should be exceptions that add color rather than something that HAS to be present throughout the planes.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I agree with you on the elemental themes.  The classical themes of the elements are generally found in the Archomentals (save Ben Hadar-- he doesn't really represent any classical associations with elemental water).  </p>

<p>Cryonax is cruel, uncaring, and emotionally subdued.  Yan-C-Bin is flighty and claustophobic-- he likes his freedom.  Chan is serene and gentle like a breeze.  Olhydra is unpredictable, and also embodies the wrath of a stormy sea and the persistence of waves/currents.  Imix is foul-tempered and passionate.  Zaaman Rul is courageous.  Ogremoch is rigid, tough, and a bully, while Sunnis is a protectress/guardian.  Crystalle is greedy.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>I disagree somewhat here. Or maybe I come at it from a different angle.</p>

<p>See, the way I see it, the Inner Planes are affected by belief as much as the Outer Planes. It just doesn't manifest the same way. The most obvious examples are Air and similar planes where "down" is whatever direction you want to be down.</p>

<p>I grant that the Inner Planes are much more static compared to the Outer. None of them are morphic like Limbo and none are in any real danger of losing layers to others or shifting their properties. The Plane of Fire is fire is fire.</p>

<p>That being said, Fire (or Water, or Air, or...) means different things to different people. I believe that creatures, entities, locations, and concepts can spring to life in the Inner Planes just as well as the Outer Planes. For one, I think it makes the Inner Planes much more interesting. For two, the overarching theme of Planescape boils down to "belief is everything." </p>

<p>The heart of an individual plane should be the pure, unadultered element. Fire is still Fire, no matter which way you look at it. The Plane of Fire is all about Fire. But I think that can (and should) be taken to the next step. The Plane of Fire is all about Fire in its various forms. Fire gets associated with anger, passion, intelligence, creativity, inspiration, light, fear, warmth and comfort, cooking, speed, and destruction, among other things. Take these themes and extrapolate where you can to populate the plane. Have creatures or places that exemplify these themes. I think that makes for a much more colorful and interesting Plane of Fire than a few archomentals plus Kossuth over there and efreeti playing happy efreeti politics over here.</p>

<p>Besides, it's not like these planes are hurting for space <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/wink.png" title="Eye-wink" alt="Eye-wink" class="smiley-content"/></p>

<p>Just to clarify, my intent with the PRP as a whole when I started it was to encourage everyone to help enhance the backdrop of each plane. Arcadia became something (imo) more interesting -- so did Bytopia and so did Gehenna. I figured if the bigger picture is enhanced, people would feel more inspiration to fill in the sites and cultures and other, more specific creations on their own. Judging from what many people like Palomides, and even Evil, have said, I feel the project is hitting its mark pretty well. Sure, the project could expand to detail more specifics, but I feel the project threads do their jobs for the most part.</p>

<p>That being said, if anyone wants to co-conspire on a predominantly fluff or cross-system (3.5 and 4e) netbook for "Arcadia: The Campaign Setting" or whatever other plane, I think that could be fun, too <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/smile.png" title="Smiling" alt="Smiling" class="smiley-content"/> Very busy, a lot of work, but I think it'd be fun.</p>

<p>WRT the Positive, I have an idea for a community of inanimate objects that gained animation and sentience through the plane's energy but I haven't had time to really hash it out in my head.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

Er, no it didn't.  Nothing was enhanced or fleshed out with Gehenna.  Its canonical nature was simply pointed out for those who couldn't see it.  (with the exception of bhargest crime lords).  Most of the brainstorm ideas were already in the canon, too.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Center- I think we are just coming from different angles. I was trying to speak out against people insisting that an elemental plane HAS to embody a particular theme throughout (e.g. everyone on the Plane of Fire being consumed with anger)</p>

<p>Although this is off the main topic, I'll mention how I handle the elemental planes. <br />
I initially thought it was odd that anyone/thing could survive on some planes. (E.g. why have a major trading city that is composed of nothing but fire?)<br />
But like you I re-envisioned the elemental planes as ones that do get modified somewhat but thought. I think Dark Sun had a set of elemental planes that were even more hospitiable than the norm; the reason was that they thought of the basic four elemental planes as more beneficial.<br />
I ran in the same way. I had the "core" of Fire be an inferno with no society, no trade, and no real motivation for visits (unless one needed a spell component of "pure fire"). These cores were usually inhospitable (although air and water never get too inhospitable)<br />
But then the closer to the "border " of the plane, the more that the structure and society of Fire would take on aspects that mortals associate with fire (anger, passion, safety, etc.) or aspects that the legends of mortals re-enforced (e.g. the City of Brass) And these areas would have societies and wouldn't be as inhospitable (meaning that an instant death isn't a guarenteed fact of visiting)<br />
But ultimately, I don't try to place too much of this imposed border on the inner planes as I feel that the underlying it all should just be the raw elemental power. They shouldn't be too affected by thought</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>Center of All</em> wrote:</div>
Just to clarify, my intent with the PRP as a whole when I started it was to encourage everyone to help enhance the backdrop of each plane. Arcadia became something (imo) more interesting -- so did Bytopia and so did Gehenna. I figured if the bigger picture is enhanced, people would feel more inspiration to fill in the sites and cultures and other, more specific creations on their own. 
</div>
I agree completely.
Sorry Hyena - Gehenna was actually given some structure instead of being just the original dumping ground for evil that they couldn't fit anywhere else. Heck, even if we only got Wormer's city out of it; it would have been a major improvement</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

The idea isn't that the elemental planes are malevolent or anything like that, but rather they represent purity of the matter or energy (and that has been explained many times in 2E and 3x by the top ranking TSR/WoTC staff when people always complained about it).  Therefore it's inimical to creatures without the requisite subtype.<br />
Fiends, celestials, etc. with natural tolerance for extreme heat can survive on Fire so long as they steer clear from the hottest parts (in theory anyway.  In practice, Fire Resistance 10 isn't much protection against 3d10 fire damage when you're spending days if not weeks in Fire's wilderness, though it should be fine while they're in the City of Brass.)  </p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">I ran in the same way. I had the "core" of Fire be an inferno with no society, no trade, and no real motivation for visits (unless one needed a spell component of "pure fire"). These cores were usually inhospitable</span></p>

<p>Why would there be no civilization there?  It's only the non-indigenous creatures that find the planes' cores to be inhospitable-- Inner Planes even stated that the unavoidable damage of True Cold only applied to non-natives.  I mean look at the Mountain of Ultimate Winter-- this is the base of Immoth civilization.  The 2nd coldest place on the plane is Cryonax's stronghold.  Even the indigenous natives find these areas to be cold, though not unbearably so. (incidentally, the Inner Planes does not outright state whether or not the Chisled Estate is an area of true cold or causes damage even to non-natives with cold immunity, though all the other statistics they give for it points to it being such.)<br />
It's more likely that the indigenous natives would find these areas to be 'sacred ground' as they represent their element at its purest and strongest (and serves as a sanctuary against 'invaders'.<br />
As for reasons, there very well is a reason for non natives to go there-- it may be the only way to smash a powerful artifact of the opposite element.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">But ultimately, I don't try to place too much of this imposed border on the inner planes as I feel that the underlying it all should just be the raw elemental power. They shouldn't be too affected by thought</span></p>

<p>Exactly my thought as well.  The elemental planes simply represent the raw physical buildingblocks of the multiverse.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Sorry Hyena - Gehenna was actually given some structure instead of being just the original dumping ground for evil that they couldn't fit anywhere else.</span></p>

<p>I have to disagree here.  Gehenna was already perfectly defined by the canon, and there is an overlying theme behind all the powers on it.<br />
It's Carceri that is the "dumping ground of evil".  With the exception of Mungoth (which represents cold of the grave and undeath), the natives and powers all have pretty homogenous goals and mentalities.  It only seems like Gehenna was lacking before because, for reasons I do not yet fathom, the themes had to be pointed out.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>We should probably discuss this elesewhere but I guess my tweaking was due to my big problem with the City of Brass.</p>

<p>I know it has its roots in Arabic legend, but it never made much sense to me. I can't see it being an effective trading center if it is going to harm many of the potential traders and cause most of the products brought to it to burn or melt (yes, I know there are some items that can take the heat; but comparitively few as opposed if such a trading center was set up in Air) <br />
I didn't want to give up the City of Brass; so I tried to justify (to myself) a reason for making the city less harsh.</p>

<p>By the same token (and in a faint effort to return to the original thread), I made the interior of the Positive to be lethal to an outsider without a TON of magical protection. I then made the "edges" a little less dangerous.<br />
E.g. Positive plane protection works without problems on my "border"; but has increasing chances of failure as one plunges into the "interior". Outsiders can live indefinitely on the border with minimal magical wards but can only survive brief forays into the core</p>

<p>You may not like my arrangement, but that was my solution</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

I can't see it being an effective trading center if it is going to harm many of the potential traders and cause most of the products brought to it to burn or melt (yes, I know there are some items that can take the heat; but comparitively few as opposed if such a trading center was set up in Air) <br />
I didn't want to give up the City of Brass; so I tried to justify (to myself) a reason for making the city less harsh.</p>

<p>By the same token (and in a faint effort to return to the original thread), I made the interior of the Positive to be lethal to an outsider without a TON of magical protection. I then made the "edges" a little less dangerous.<br />
E.g. Positive plane protection works without problems on my "border"; but has increasing chances of failure as one plunges into the "interior". Outsiders can live indefinitely on the border with minimal magical wards but can only survive brief forays into the core</p>

<p>You may not like my arrangement, but that was my solution</div></p>

<p>IIRC, it's mentioned in some book (can't remember if it's a Planescape or 3e book) that the City of Brass is enchanted so it's livable for PC races. Comfort is questionable, but it's at least somewhere a human could get by.</p>

<p>The reason for this is the efreeti keep mortal slaves -- not to the point where they have the dao's reputation as slavers but they have mortal slaves. So magic (or maybe belief) keeps the City of Brass hospitable enough for "normal people" to visit.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Most sources have the City of Brass hot, but survivable by mortals, its temperature subject to the will of the Great Sultan. It's kept around the temperature of a sweltering summer's day (100 F or so) precisely so it can function as a cross-planar center of trade.</p>

<p>I don't have a philosophical problem with making the inner planes more hospitable. Many of them are already survivable for primes (including Air, Water, and Earth) so saying, for example, that the air above the Sea of Flames isn't quite hot enough to burn flesh (but you wouldn't want to fall in the sea itself) would be okay.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I know these are the best explanations available but it still seems a bit stilted.<br />
If I remember correctly, the efreet sultan (or pasha or whatever title he is) lives in the City of Brass. <br />
If the whole city were at this reduced temperature, then that makes as much sense as asking the Emperor of France to live in a freezer for the benefit of his guests. <br />
I made (perhaps based on something I read) sectors of the city (trade district/slave quarters/etc.) to be survivable hot while the palace and efreet neighborhoods were normal full-effect hot. (This also helps keep the slaves from running away - where could they go?)</p>

<p>But my original, poorly expresed point was that I personally like these exceptions (cities for trade, etc.) and places affected by thought (e.g. places in Fire for purification, places of emotional passion, etc.) on the "edge" of plane while keeping the central core a place of raw elemental force.<br />
It doesn't affect play too much; but I like a large part of an elemental plane to be raw element without any outside associations or purposes placed on it.<br />
Ultimately, that's just a preference of mine.</p>

<p>I hope we can get back to the topic soon as I feel that i've helped hijack this thread</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>That used to bother me, but it forces us to consider several related questions. If living outside of a roasting fire is unpleasant for efreet, is it just as unpleasant for djinn to live on solid ground? Shouldn't they float through the airy void (avoiding even vaporous clouds as a contamination) rather than on islands of earth, ice, and steel? Shouldn't dao live most of their lives phasing through solid rock instead of in bubbles of alien air? Should the marids avoid air bubbles in their palaces? Genies in general aren't really personifications of their home planes; they're personifications of magic and wishes, and most seem to enjoy mixing the elements. That said, it makes sense for the Great Sultan's private chambers (and some neighborhoods), at least, to be a furnace. I wouldn't make the entire sultan's palace an inferno, since he needs to be able to welcome guests and ambassadors from other planes.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Back to the main topic, a brief look into the psychology of the glimmerskin:</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">it's an infinite star, a sea of meaningless light that goes on and on. Supposedly, there are settlements where creatures of flesh live protected from the sheer overwhelming intensity of life. I never saw them. Before I left the plane, I never "saw" anything. It's all light, no gradiations, nothing for vision to pick up. Indeed, there was hardly a "me." I was nearly one with the plane, nothing but a feeling of restlessness surrounded by a circle of maddeningly serene elders. </p>

<p>The elders do not want us to leave. They disapprove of our adventures. But we became increasingly addicted to them. The feeling of flesh, of air and water and fire and earth, is like nothing on my plane. Most of all, we grew addicted to battle, to adrenaline and sweat and pain and victory and defeat. This is life, not the stale and constant boredom of the positive energy plane. </p>

<p>The elders are increasingly impatient. They say we are interfering with the development of souls. They say our skin-riding is an abomination. </p>

<p>But where did the elders come from? Why are they so different from us? Where did they get their serenity, their knowledge of the workings of other planes, and most of all their individuality? </p>

<p>Of course, they were once like us. Perhaps for centuries they leapt from body to body on this wonderous material plane, and in the bodies of warriors and adventurers they learned about magic, money, sex, and of course the struggle for life in death in the thick of battle, until they finally felt ready to retire. And they presume to judge us. </p>

<p>I only hope things don’t go too far. With the knowledge and skills they must still have, it would be very awkward if they came to collect their wandering young. </span></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Not as long as they can fly around as they please.  Though yeah, this probably means they're going to be claustrophobic just like the air elementals.  A Djinn forced to walk/etc. instead of fly around is definitely going to be uncomfortrable, as well.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Should the marids avoid air bubbles in their palaces? </span><br />
No.  The marids don't mind whether they're in air or water so long as they're 'not out of their element'.  As long as they're partially submerged in water, they're quite comfortrable.  Though I recall the Al Qadim books mentioning that marid wear many layers (about 5-20) of water-soaked clothing when they intend to travel to the desert cities of Zakhara.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>My campaign recently took place in the Positive. Basically, it was about this wizard who became addicted to positive energy, and in my setting overdose of positive energy makes you mutate because your body is trying to get rid of the excess lifeforce. By the time we met him he was a hideous monstrosity, which was expressed in game mechanics by giving him tons of grafts and making him an Aberration.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>After re-reading through this thread (due to a spammer bump), an idea popped into my head about a potential native Positive race:</p>

<p>Living things on Pos fill up with energy and eventually become overloaded and explode/die.  My idea has a living race that is constantly changing form. Different bits and pieces of them are continually filling up with positive energy and bursting apart.  However, they're also constantly morphing their body and moving into those bits that aren't quite as filled as other bits.  So interacting with whatever this race is in an exercise in talking with something that's constantly bursting apart/disintegrating but is also constantly renewing itself by changing shape.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">
