</div> <p><span style="font-size:22px">Modern Heaven</span></p>

<p>Whether it was inevitable, deliberate, or some combination of the two, the Seven Heavens of Mount Celestia have evolved as a bright and shining mirror of its lawful evil counterpart. All the corrupt and sinister aspects of the Nine Hells have been inverted and purified by the Celestian archons. </p>

<p>The archons have changed slightly. Nearly all of them are completely humanoid and wingless; only their slightly metallic complexions and unusual height distinguish them from ordinary humans, elves, halflings, or dwarves (in a few cases, they seem to be golden-skinned goblins). They dress in uniformly severe business suits in most situations, dark gray with only the color of their ties and wristwatches denoting rank. Military archons wear uniforms of black leather set off by dog collars. The lower ranks are equipped with automatic weapons; the higher ranks don't need them.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold"><span style="font-size:16px">Lunia</span></span><br />
Lunia, also known as Shamayim, Jannatu el-Khuld, the Silver or Coral Heaven, and Yesod, is primarily Greater Heart's Faith, a cool silver metropolis seeming to stretch into infinity in this layer - all shining metallic high-rises, perfectly engineered freeways, and subway systems that are always precisely on time. The Silver Sea, once so dominant, has now retreated to the far "edges" of the plane, far beyond the region most visitors and residents see. The stars that once illuminated the plane are now masked by the lights of Greater Heart's Faith, whose neon and florescent glow makes the streets seem bright as day beneath the twilight sky. Billboards and other advertisements are ubiquitous here.</p>

<p>The petitioners of Lunia are those not ambitious enough to strive for Celestia's higher reaches. They live mundane, unexceptional afterlives in data entry, secretarial positions, and classic rock DJs. The elite do design work for Barachiel's ad campaigns.They shuffle off to their cubicals for eight hours and then go home to their apartments. They do not strive for anything more. If they did, they wouldn't be in Lunia for long.</p>

<p>Security in Lunia is subtle, so as not to scare away potential customers. Hound archons disguise themselves as ordinary citizens, their briefcases containing tasers and automatic weapons. Greater Heart's Faith is also filled with secret cameras, the better to ensure the safety of all.</p>

<p>Other hound archons drive taxis. For some reason, most of them claim to be named Michael.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Mahlhevik Records</span><br />
The producer-mogul Mahlhevik was once a chaotic and evil wizard of terrible power and cruelty, it is said. This hasn't been true for centuries. Now Mahlhevik uses his place in one of the oldest and tallest of skyscrapers in Greater Heart's Faith, a masterpiece of postmodern architecture resembling a silver flame, as a combination recording studio and music label. Mahlhevik specializes in bringing the music of the celestial choirs to the greater multiverse, and some of his old cruelty shines through a bit in his ruthlessness in finding and keeping distributors and his insistance that his artists always fulfill their contracts precisely and on time. Mahlhevik still continues his old policy of allowing visitors of all alignments into his offices, and isn't above signing a fiendish act. Thus, Mahlhevik Records can be a place of intense rivalries and intrigues as succubus divas scream at firre prima donnas, and Celestian choirs dis in their lyrics choirs of screaming Baatific petitioners who have been surgically altered in vile ways. Disturbing disappearances aren't unknown. "The market will decide what's best," Mahlhevik says, and the tome archon Barachiel agrees.</p>

<p>Israfel is Mahlhevik's primary assistant and the representative of the archons set to watch the wizard, just in case. He seems sad and distant, since although he works in a music company he hasn't had time to play music himself in a long, long time. He still has the ability to unfold four angelic wings if he desires; the last time he did this was seventy years ago.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">The Towers of Stars</span><br />
The only building taller than Mahlhevik Records, the Towers of Stars are four white office buildings many kilometers high, joined together by silver tunnels at each floor. It is here that Barachiel, Tome Archon of Lunia, has his headquarters. </p>

<p>An outspoken member of the Free Trader clique in the Celestian hierarchy, Barachiel believes that tyranny and injustice will ultimately crumble thanks to the power of the free market. The more choices people have, he reasons, the more they will demand the right to choose goodness and order, especially if most of the products they use and enjoy come from Mount Celestia. He campaigns to have trade restrictions reduced all across the planes. As part of this, his layer has the largest advertising budget of anyone on the plane. Primarily he spends this promoting the products of the many companies based in Greater Heart's Faith, as well as promoting the idea free trade in general.  </p>

<p>Of the Lords of the Nine, Barachiel is most opposed to Levistus and Dispater.</p>

<p>Also in the Towers of Stars, but deep beneath the city streets, are the headquarters of the layer's military. Their chief general is Pheleg, an agathinon with a crusty and somewhat arrogant demeanor. He reports to Barachiel, but considers himself far better informed in military matters than his superior. He and Barachiel argue constantly, but he is too good at his job to be rid of.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold"><span style="font-size:16px">Mercuria</span></span><br />
Mercuria, the Golden Heaven, also known as Raquia, Hod, Jannatu el-Adn, or the Gardens of Perpetual Abode, is much closer to its medieval state than Lunia. Its sky is still bright gold; it's still filled with lush valleys and pure streams as well as rivers of oil, wine, honey, and milk. The tombs to fallen heroes are all cared for and well-preserved, and are popular tourist destinations for those who prove themselves worthy of ascending this high up the Mountain.</p>

<p>The places of learning, always important in Mercuria, have expanded greatly. Now the layer is filled with schools and universities, each the size of cities, but what really dominates the layer now is its tech industry; archons who once forged celestial weapons now make microchips in clean suits. Petitioners who were geniuses in the high-tech industries in life continue their careers here, accessing their former memories - or anyone else's -  from the Astral Plane as needed thanks to powerful psionic search engines that scour the silver void.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Bahamut</span> has abandoned his old palace, turning it into a museum open to all. He wanders the multiverse in the form of an old homeless man surrounded by golden canaries who are, in another form, golden dragons. He rides freight cars from plane to plane and drifts through the planar cities, invisible in the seas of mortal flesh.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Aurilon, the Golden Spire</span> is preserved exactly the way it was centuries ago, a 400 foot-tall tower of burnished gold by a pristine lake. This is the administrative center of the Golden Heaven. The former tome archon, Domiel, admitted he was out of his league when the layer went high-tech, and has long since ascended to the Illuminated Heaven. The new Tome is Remiel, who formally ran the Eschequer of Souls in Jovar. The digital revolution delighted Remiel, whose job was made so much easier by fast processing speeds.  He immediately jumped head-first into the data age, and was a natural choice to replace Domiel. He is eagerly directing projects to develop programs that can read difficult forms of data, like dreams and fire.</p>

<p>Remiel is a friendly and forgiving archon, always glad to look at the positive side of every situation. However, he has a stern side too, and is not afraid to punish those who fall short in their duties toward goodness and law. Mercuria thus has a secret prison complex for errant archons, where Remiel works hard to redeem his wayward brothers and sisters.</p>

<p>Remiel is part of the Free Trader clique in the Celestian hierarchy; together with Barachiel and Erathaol, he believes that the more Celestian products distributed throughout the multiverse, the more goodness and law will follow. Of the Lords of the Nine, he is most opposed to Mammon.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold"><span style="font-size:16px">Venya</span></span><br />
The Pearly Heaven, also known by such names as Sagun, Jannatu el-Ma'wa, Daru el-Qarar, Shehaquin, Netzach, Paradise, the Gardens of Refuge, the Dwelling of Peace, and Summerland, is the center of agriculture on the Mount. Its green fields are sown with all manners of edible or useful plants, and celestial cattle volunteer to be slaughtered for meat. There are even oil wells pumping the black blood of the mountain into barrels ready to be refined. The whole process is guided with great precision and economy by the tome archon Erathaol the Seer, who has made it his business to advance the science of agriculture to unprecedented heights. Every day he comes up with new efficiency guidelines, new and better ways of accomplishing the same thing. A new, daring idea he has is the renewal of old "pagan" fertility rituals; he has gathered many books on Wicca, Thelema, and even Tantra, and is experimenting with different ways that sexmagic can be used by lesser archons and petitioners to enhance the soil.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">The Glass Tarn</span><br />
An icy mountain lake in a secluded valley, the Glass Tarn has long been held to have great and profound powers. Erathaol once traveled regularly to this place of prophecy, which has defied explanation by modern science and thaumaturgy. He believes it is a channel by which the mysterious crown archons of the Illuminated Heaven communicate to the multiverse at large, beings with names like Duma and Izra'il. For the past one hundred and twenty years, however, few have journeyed here to draw forth its secrets. Erathaol has not visited it at all.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Shireton</span><br />
What was once the Green Fields is now a major city equal to any on the planes - only smaller. Modern halflings have adapted fully and enthusiastically to urban life, and the realm of their goddess Yondalla has followed suit. It looks much like a human city, and indeed has many portals to other cities throughout the planes through which halflings can slip in and out like mice through cracks in the walls. Yondalla is a kind, matronly power, lovingly tolerant of the missteps of her chosen people, but lately her other aspect, the shadowy, chaotic Dallah Thaun, has begun to dominate. As more and more residential buildings have turned themselves into smuggling operations trying to slip Celestian goods out of the plane without the archons' knowledge, it is beginning to look more and more as if Shireton does not belong on this plane. The more lawful halflings have actually begun to leave.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Xiranthador</span><br />
Erathaol's library-fortress of seashells still exists, but the sea it once lay under does not; it was drained to make room for more crops, something that was probably an overzealous measure on an infinite layer. Erathaol never does things by halves, however. He is a loyal member of the Free Trader clique, pushing to produce as many agricultural goods as possible, to feed, clothe, and fuel the multiverse with goods grown in the soil of incarnate goodness and law. Of the Lords of the Nine, he despises Belial and Fierana the most.</p>

<p>Erathaol's old interests in prophecy and learning have unfortunately fallen by the wayside, mostly delegated to subordinates he rarely pays attention to. His loyal seers, however, have found something interesting, and something they believe to be vital: a prophecy that Mount Celestia itself will fall, and its corruption will be from within. In a panic, they put an extra solar in charge of watching the halflings until they realized that it was not from Shireton that the threat came. But where? They need more seers on the project to find out, but Erathaol never has time for them anymore.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold"><span style="font-size:16px">Solania</span></span><br />
The Crystal Heaven is called Daru el-Salam, and the Dwelling Which Abideth. Pistis Sophia, the tome archon of the layer, calls it Utopia.</p>

<p>Solania has been engineered by Pistis Sophia to be the perfect socialist state. As part of the Enlightened Despot clique she opposes the Free Traders and all they stand for; she believes goods should be the property of the state and distributed freely as needed. The notion of selling goods for a profit or charging interest for loans - all things advocated by the Free Traders - is disgusting and dangerous to her. She believes that the secret of spreading the ideals of law and good throughout the planes isn't through crass commodities, but by acting as a shining and flawless example of Celestia's ideals.</p>

<p>Solania's high, treacherous mountains have been bridged with broad highways forming a perfect grid between the layer's major cities, and crosses diagonally between t hem as well. Each city is also laid in a grid. Each city performs a specific function in the social machine that is Solania; Tiphereth is the medical center; Mechanon is its industrial center, creating vehicles and weapons; Salem is its academic and administrative center; Erewhon manufactures soft goods, textiles and the like; Zebhul produces food. All under Pistis Sophia's command are expected to fulfill the function her tests determine that they're best at. They should not leave their designated districts without reason. Although there are official vacation days scheduled at regular intervals, the amount of forms and passports needed to travel anywhere beyond Solania make such trips nearly impossible.</p>

<p>Of the Lords of the Nine, Pistis Sophia most reviles Baalzebul, who was once known as Triel, though she saves quite a lot of animosity for the Hag Countess of Malbolge.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Erackinor</span><br />
The greatest and most sacred mountain of the Morndinsamman, Erackinor is home to the dwarven gods Moradin, Berronar, and Tharmekhul. Unlike the bustling technocracies of Dwarven Mountain in the Outlands or the bizarre Chaos-Works of Nidvellir in Ysgard, the dwarven spirits of Erackinor have not adapted to modern technologies. They practice blacksmithing and other traditional tasks, maintaining an art practically dead on other planes because their god insists on it. The settlements of Istor's Forge, Stonefall, the Rift, and Berronar's Side are much the same as they've been for tens of thousands of years.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">The Monastery of the Planes-Militant</span><br />
The Planes-Militant, on the other hand, have undergone a radical update. A military base considered exceptional in the planes, its technology is decades ahead of anything else on the plane. With a fleet of helicopters and fighter jets capable of crossing planar boundaries and a tremendous stockpile of tactical missiles, the air force and marines of the Planes-Militant are ready to take on any challenge anywhere in the multiverse. Their nuclear store is kept secret from outsiders; they want it to be a surprise.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Uroboros</span><br />
Uroboros, called the Gates of Wisdom, is a realm in mid-air, just beyond every one of Solania's peaks. It is intangible and transcendent; words of power spoken there are said to become living creatures of flesh. It is the only gate to the heaven of Mertion. The hermaphroditic couatl god Jazirian has been missing for a long time; it is feared she is dead, or asleep like her counterpart Merrshaulk in the Abyss. Caring for it in her absence is Aulasha the Librarian, a goddess of a race called the Illumians. She makes sure everyone who seeks to ascend to the higher heavens is properly tested, and she conforts the couatls in their father-mother's absence. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold"><span style="font-size:16px">Mertion</span></span><br />
The White Silver or Platinum Heaven is also known as Geburah, Jannatu el-Na'im, Machon or Ma'on, and Logres. The "mountains" of this layer are impenetrable black domes known as the Sentinels; in all the centuries the archons have not revealed to any not indoctrinated in their ranks what purpose they serve. The skies are silver-gray like the Astral Plane, but seem far brighter to those not sufficiently lawful or good; painfully, almost agonizingly so.</p>

<p>Mertion is a military dictatorship ruled wisely by Raziel, the tome archon now known as the Crusader. Raziel the Firestar was once the angel of divine wisdom, content to write in his book and contemplate the mysteries of the planes. It was he, it is said, who first brought the secrets of arcane magic to the eldest dragons.</p>

<p>It was only after the destruction of his predecessor, the warlord Mika'il, that he was appointed chief of Heaven's armies, originally as the chief sword archon of Soqed Hezi and later as the Tome of all Mertion. He took to it slowly, at first studying only books on warfare and strategy. With all his theory, his first campaigns were disastrous. Only later did he understand the real horrors of war and begin to study in earnest, this time with personal experience as his greatest tutor.</p>

<p>When Pistis Sophia and Sealtiel first began discussing their theories of Enlightened Despotism, both Raziel's scholarly mind and his military mind were intrigued, but he disagreed with much of what they had to say. The other Tomes spoke of the enlightened rule of scholars, but Raziel had already been down that path and had met, to his sorrow, its limitations. Only the discipline of a military mind could create the ideal society, he knew, so when he began to create his own utopia he put soldiers at the top of its hierarchy.</p>

<p>Of the lords of Hell, Raziel's natural rival is Bel, the Warlord of Avernus.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">The Hall of Heralds</span><br />
The fabled Hall of Heralds lie in the region known as Arvenna, the Chanting Grounds. The Heralds keep meticulous records of all the activities of everyone who dwells in Mertion - their great deeds, their not-so-great deeds. With great pragmatism born from brutal experience in battle, they ensure that everyone does their part in society, and that everyone's talents are used to the fullest.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">The City of Tempered Souls</span><br />
The old city of Empyrea has been much expanded and modernized. As a place of healing, it has no equal in the planes; Tiphereth in Solania is a village midwife by comparison. The very latest medical equipment combines with doctors on the cutting edge of medical research to ensure that everyone in Mertion is in condition for fighting as soon as possible. The entire city is sterile, and no one can enter or leave without an elaborate decontamination process. The head doctor and chief military officer in the city is the throne archon Och, who took over after his predecessor Tarahiel's unfortunate fall from grace.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">The City of the Sands of Time</span><br />
The Celestial Time Police leave Rempha, the City of the Sands of Time, through a massive time-gate through the Demiplane of Time into all times and places in history. The time-travelling equipment invented by the rogue modron Secundus has become very advanced indeed with the addition of modern processors, and the veil of time is not a barrier for them. This is still, somehow, a secret kept by the archons, and it seems no one else has yet found out about it. Still, other races occasionally find their own ways of traveling through time, and the Celestial Time Police make sure they don't affect history for the worse.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">The City of Swords</span><br />
Soqed Hezi, the City of Swords, is the center of martial strength in Raziel's domain. While its technology is not as advanced as that of the Planes-Militant, Soqed Hezi's airfleet is certainly far, far bigger, with all the resources of Mount Celestia at its disposal. The military leader here, a sword archon named Ruth, is answerable only to Raziel.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">The Celestial Court</span><br />
Seeming to teeter at the edge of a bottomless chasm, the Celestial Court is one of the most feared citadels in all the Heavens. Here are the headquarters for Mount Celestia's own police force; these are the archons who police other archons, a dangerous force to cross indeed. They do not answer to Raziel; their ultimate leader is Saraqael, who runs the Exchequer of Souls in Jovar.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold"><span style="font-size:16px">Jovar</span></span><br />
Illiyun, Chesed, Zebul, Makhon, the Heaven of Gems: whatever it is called, the Glittering Heavens are the very summit of Mount Celestia. Beyond is the great unknown, the bright light above. Jovar is a place of jeweled world-facets, raw elements, storms, and Yetsirah, the Unending Ziggurat and the Heavenly City. It is so far removed from the material world that it defies description.</p>

<p>The tome archon guardian of Jovar is Sealtiel, known as the Defender. Another member of the Enlightened Despot clique, Sealtiel has constructed from his layer a strict meritocracy. Everyone in the layer gets a ranking of how wise, how intelligent, how spiritual, how lawful and how good they are; those with higher total rankings command those with lower ones. Those with higher rankings in a specific area command those with lower rankings in that area - but only in situations where that area is most relevant. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">The Heavenly City</span> is Yetsirah, a ziggurat-shaped metropolis of moving walkways and escalators that ascends into the infinite sky. On the very top is rumored to be the bridge of al-Sihal, a freeway made of light that extends into the following layer.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Pax Exaltea</span> is Sealtiel's fortress near Yetsirah's very top, just below al-Sihal. It is itself a ziggurat made entirely of gemstones the size of buses. Sealtiel keeps himself busy those judged the most competent what to do, and they in turn tell others. Sealtiel commands the layer's armed forces, protecting the sacred Bridge, and entertains those who are honestly worthy of ascending it. When he is not busy with all that, he opposes the works of Baator's lord Mephistopheles.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">The Celestial Exchequer</span> is the highest court of law on the plane, and the headquarters of the law firm of Saraqael, Qaddisite, Qaddasite, Irite, Irite, and Uriel. These six archons (the Qaddasin and Irin are two pairs of twins) were once led by Remiel before he became the tome archon of Mercuria; now they have formed a celestial law firm that specializes in countering the diabolic lawyers of Baator. The celestial law squad comes, dressed in their identical gray suits, unsummoned and unbidden wherever it is needed, dismissing any existing attourneys with a severe glance. They have trained hard in the legalese of Baator, Gehenna, and elsewhere, and they are confident there is no good-aligned force in the multiverse more competent to defeat fiendish lawyers at their own game.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold"><span style="font-size:16px">Chronia</span></span><br />
The layer known as the Illuminated Heaven is also called Da'ath, Araboth, the Great Mystery, the Illuminated Heaven, Jannatu el-Firdaus, and the Ancient of Days. It is silence, solitude, emptiness, stillness, mystery and transcendence. Araboth is both the Eternity and the Time of all things prior to days and eternity and time. It is the home of the Unknowable, which the greatest and eldest of seraphim revere; the Unknowable is cognate to the Athar's Great Unknown, and represents the positive side of their faith as the Serpent Trench of Nessus represents the negative. </p>

<p>Chronia is the gap, the mystery; the space between the known of Jovar and the unknown. The separation created when the Aeons left the Mount for the realities beyond. It is the place where knowledge ends, the time and place of rest, the sacred taboo.</p>

<p>The current Tome of Chronia, Camael, inherited his position when the original tome archon Zaphkiel gave himself up to final transcendence, either merging with the pure white light of the plane or ascending to still higher layers. Camael was formally the leader of the Celestial Court in Mertion, a strangely scarred sword archon with a history of compromising deals with the lower planes. He and almost everyone else thought that he was just about the last possible choice to inherit Zaphkiel's title, but Zaphkiel saw a basic decency in him, a willingness to bend the rules in order to enforce their spirit that the other tome archons lacked. After several months of rituals intended to purge him body and spirit and bring him to full throne archon status, Camael was guided across the bridge of al-Sihal, to his destiny. Zaphkiel imparted some final advice to him, shook his hand, and transformed him into his current form, that of a golden-skinned humanoid with the right half of his face wreathed in darkness. Then Zaphkiel vanished, leaving Camael with the keys to the chocolate factory (as it were).</p>

<p>Camael's responsibility is enormous now, but he always took his jobs seriously, regardless of how much he felt like he was screwing them up. Camael is gifted with a far-sightedness, a long-term view that even other immortals fall short on, and he believes that no one is unredeemable, not the worst of fiends, not the Dark Lord of Nessus himself.</p>

<p>Camael still feels like he is not worthy of the role that has been thrust upon him, but he knows that Zaphkiel did not believe anyone else would be better, and Camael trusts Zaphkiel's judgement. He tries to guide the other archons wisely. Refusing to commit to either the Free Trader or Enlightened Despot cliques, he steers the plane toward a clear middle ground that Camael hopes will end up providing the best for everyone. </p>

<p>Camael, now called the Watcher after Zaphkiel, feels obliged to watch over everything in the multiverse. He keeps a particular eye on the fiends, but feels it is his role to look specifically at the fiend called Asmodeus, the Dark Lord of Nessus, and hopes his counterparts elsewhere will keep an equally vigilant eye on those most like them.</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">The Cliques:</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">The Enlightened Despots</span><br />
Ruling for the good at all, the Enlightened Despots seek to use well-intentioned principles of logic and reason to bring peace and well-being to the citizens of the planes.</p>

<p>Pistis Sophia, Sealtiel, Raziel</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">The Free Traders</span><br />
The Celestial Trade Organization seeks to bring prosperity and equality to the planes by controlling economies and the flow of capital. </p>

<p>Barachiel, Remiel, Erathaol</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">The Independents</span><br />
A faction unto himself, Camael the Watcher belongs to neither of the other two Celestian cliques. Whether this is because he sees merit in both approaches or because he sees merit in neither is something he keeps to himself.</p>       </div>

         <p>[Edited into usefulness]</p>

<p>It's a smooth and comfortable kind of read, though I have to wonder if its presentation is quite fitting. I quite like the thought, though, of Celestia being an inversion of Baator.</p>

<p>To start with, the Cliques seem reasonably well-defined. It seems a little odd that the higher layers are despotic, while the lower ones are trade-based; is this a result of accessibility concerns, or are the despotic regimes somehow better?<br />
The other point to be made here is that a free-trade clique is going to be exerting a very limited influence on trade. I imagine market distortions (like subsidies, price floors and ceilings, tariffs and so forth) would be either incredibly limited or non-existent, letting the market stabilise itself for maximal resource efficiency. Taxes would be spent on infrastructure development and, presumably, a well-designed welfare system.</p>

<p>Lunia doesn't really have a lawful-good feel to it. Its petitioners, rarely exceeding their standards and expectations, make it almost seem like the layer's ready to slide off into Arcadia. Barachiel seems like the kind to offer export subsidies, to try to compete against extraplanar import barriers.</p>

<p>Mercuria raises an interesting question. I was under the impression that petitioners only lost semantic memory upon death.<br />
The layer's likely to have strong competition for more computer-oriented petitioners, too. I'm not entirely comfortable with the idea of a psionic AstralSearch, though.</p>

<p>Venya's a bit of an interesting one. A couple of things defy comment without adding 'nsfw' in big letters.<br />
A free trade clique is quite unlikely to have a place for smuggling operations. If things can get in and out with a minimum of restriction, then smuggling simply isn't a profitable business - unless it's done to get around restrictions elsewhere.<br />
Venya seems to be hitting capacity problems, too - which makes for an interesting plot aspect, because a lot of very interesting things happen when economies hit their limits. Almost none of them are good.</p>

<p>It's at this point I'll make a brief mention of socialism, especially the idea that government should eventually cease to exist. The term I think you're after is 'planned economies', or similar.</p>

<p>Solania's an instant and brutal rejection of the previous layers, which is interesting in its own ways.</p>

<p>Mertion, to put it simply, reminds me of the clans from Battletech; I can imagine some of their social structures being used there.</p>

<p>My biggest concern with Jovar isn't that they have lawyers that can counter the fiends. The thought of them just striding in whenever they're needed isn't my favourite; then again, their ideas of 'need' aren't quite the same as for others. It'd be interesting, too, if they try to negotiate the fiends into the kinds of corners they paint others into.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I like this settup for heaven, however, Lunia seems a bit more neutral than one would expect in Celestia.  Heaven is a place of hope, and, in my opnion, the first layer should be more energetic than your description makes it feel like.  People are at the begining of their great reward, they have achived the first Heaven, and are ready to ascend to even greater joys.<br />
But other than that, it is very well done.</p>

Having all three sources able to affect history prevents any one from alteringing in a really drastic manor.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Interesting.</p>

<p>Something I've noticed, is that as soon as you mix two alignments, like Law and Evil, or Law and Good, the outsiders dedicated to the concept take up a few behaviors that at first glance seem to almost contradict one of their alignment aspects.  It is very intriguing.</p>

<p>I don't know about you, but it seems to me that Celestia teters on the brink of another Great Fall, or at least loosing some of its archons to Arborea or Elysia.  This will be fun.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Thanks for all the comments, guys.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&quot;Persephone Imytholin&quot;</em> wrote:</div>I have to wonder if its presentation is quite fitting.</div></p>

<p>What do you mean? How would you have done it?</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>To start with, the Cliques seem reasonably well-defined. It seems a little odd that the higher layers are despotic, while the lower ones are trade-based; is this a result of accessibility concerns, or are the despotic regimes somehow better?</div></p>

<p>I assume that all the tome archons are more or less equally lawful and good (with Camael something of an exception, though I'm not entirely sure how much of one). All of them ascended on their own merit at least up to the sixth layer of the plane before being transformed into their current forms; they've learned the lessons the plane sought to impart and proved their worthiness. The particular philosophies of each, then, aren't supposed to be progressively more good (or progressively more lawful), though the layers themselves are.</p>

<p>As for the layers, they <span style="font-style:italic">do</span> become both more strongly good-aligned and more orderly as they progress toward the seventh peak, since each layer builds on the lessons of the previous one. Lunia is the closest to the Outlands; it is both less good than Bytopia and less lawful than Arcadia (although this latter quality didn't really come across, and should be revised). It's somewhat more lawful and good than Excelsior, but doesn't need to be greatly so; the "average" citizen of Lunia is going to be not nearly as good or lawful than the average citizen of Celestia in general, since there's a constant departure of the best and brightest to the higher layers. Also, Lunia in this imagining has a lot of congress with many other planes, and this also contaminates it.</p>

<p>I didn't deal so much with this aspect of the plane, however; I mostly dealt with the way each tome archon had manipulated the layers in the wake of the modernization of the planes. Archons, as I mentioned before, might well have ascended to higher layers before being assigned to their current positions, and this is true for the tomes more than any.</p>

<p>The decision to divide the rulers into philosophies was a deliberate attempt to mirror the way deadone had divided the Hells. I also liked the idea that the two groups would represent economic views from the left and right of the political spectrum, with the idea that neither was inherently more "good" or "evil" than the other.  The authoritarian/anti-authoritarian axis is less of an issue: neither group is populated by democrats. The economic leftists tend more toward fascism (this wasn't a deliberate attempt by me to link the two philosophies, just an inadvertant link that came from translating deadone's hell factions; I might fix this). I thought this was kind of interesting, though; is a heavily authoritarian government inherently evil, or is it just the (very real) possibility of corruption we fear? What if the supreme leader was (almost) guaranteed to have the best interests of the people in mind? Would it be so bad then? From a chaotic/freedom-loving perspective, yes, but not from the perspective of beings for whom law and good are inseperable.</p>

<p>The actual division of the layers between laisse faire capitalists and economic leftist/authoritarians then, was based more on what I thought would fit best than where they fit as rungs on the celestial ladder. Which philosophy fits better with Solania/Pistis Sophia? It just happened to be that the arrangement that worked best in my mind clustered the members of both groups together.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the "enlightened despot" group (yeah, I think I really do need to at least change their name) does seem to be more lawful than the "free trader" group, and the layers <span style="font-style:italic">ought</span> to be getting more orderly as the lessons of the plane weed out those with more chaotic bents. Like I said, I didn't try to make them seem more good; that's harder to do anyway, especially with my cynical attitude.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>The other point to be made here is that a free-trade clique is going to be exerting a very limited influence on trade.</div></p>

<p>That's a good point, too. I wrote the definitions of the cliques before I started describing the layers, and I think something got lost in translation.  Should they really be laisse-faire capitalists, or are they mercantilists instead? I seem to have had both ideas in my head simultaneously. Simply removing barriers that were once in place is going to itself affect the cross-planar economy significantly, but once that happens and things stabilize they're going to have less to do.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Lunia doesn't really have a lawful-good feel to it. Its petitioners, rarely exceeding their standards and expectations, make it almost seem like the layer's ready to slide off into Arcadia.</div></p>

<p>The layer is where the natural portals to Arcadia will be located; their influence will create places in Lunia as Arcadian as the gate-town of Fortitude, though coming from a different base reality. What I need to remind myself is that there are just as many portals to Bytopia, so there will also be places very much like Tradegate. On second thought, maybe I didn't do such a bad job with that.</p>

<p>I didn't mean to say that most petitioners in Lunia rarely exceed expectations, only that those that do naturally progress to further heights, so the average is brought down significantly.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Barachiel seems like the kind to offer export subsidies, to try to compete against extraplanar import barriers.</div></p>

<p>Yeah, he does. Maybe he believes in subsidizing Celestian goods only so long as barriers exist?</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Mercuria raises an interesting question. I was under the impression that petitioners only lost semantic memory upon death.</div></p>

<p>They lose class levels.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>I'm not entirely comfortable with the idea of a psionic AstralSearch</div></p>

<p>I don't have any strong feelings about it, personally. Consider it gone.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>A free trade clique is quite unlikely to have a place for smuggling operations</div></p>

<p>I think what I meant to say was "fencing operations"; the halfling steal goods from the Celestians and sell them off-plane. Yeah, that's pretty different.</p>

<p>I do like the idea that the halflings sell Celestian goods in places where they might be illegal or limited. The archons would probably look at that more favorably, although deliberately allowing them to violate interplanar law makes them look bad and is against their natures.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>It's at this point I'll make a brief mention of socialism, especially the idea that government should eventually cease to exist. </div></p>

<p>I was actually thinking about that shortly before I wrote it, mostly because of <a href="http://www.qwantz.com/index.pl?comic=502" class="bb-url">this comic page</a>. I'm not sure whether the "socialist" tome archons are true socialists in the Marxist sense or not; I think they might actually be. After all, if their forms of government are intended as models for the rest of the multiverse, creating self-regulating systems that don't require a perfect celestial leader in order to work is a practical goal. Perhaps they simply haven't achieved it yet, or don't believe they have.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>It'd be interesting, too, if they try to negotiate the fiends into the kinds of corners they paint others into.</div></p>

<p>I agree.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&quot;Kaelyn&quot;</em> wrote:</div><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&quot;Persephone Imytholin&quot;</em> wrote:</div>I have to wonder if its presentation is quite fitting.</div>
What do you mean? How would you have done it?</div></p>

<p>There's just a few things in there, probably just since it's a forum thread. The chocolate factory bit, frex.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>The particular philosophies of each, then, aren't supposed to be progressively more good (or progressively more lawful), though the layers themselves are.</div></p>

<p>*nodnods* So the lower layers are chosen for their access to other planes?</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Lunia is the closest to the Outlands; it is both less good than Bytopia and less lawful than Arcadia (although this latter quality didn't really come across, and should be revised)</div></p>

<p>*nods* Agreed.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>It's somewhat more lawful and good than Excelsior, but doesn't need to be greatly so ... Also, Lunia in this imagining has a lot of congress with many other planes, and this also contaminates it.</div></p>

<p>That much makes sense. With all of the above, just be careful not to give the impression that one form of government is inherently more good than another.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>The decision to divide the rulers into philosophies was a deliberate attempt to mirror the way deadone had divided the Hells. I also liked the idea that the two groups would represent economic views from the left and right of the political spectrum, with the idea that neither was inherently more "good" or "evil" than the other.</div></p>

<p>All the more reason to suggest that the layers are chosen by the archons for their own traits, rather than their lawfulness.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>The economic leftists tend more toward fascism (this wasn't a deliberate attempt by me to link the two philosophies, just an inadvertant link that came from translating deadone's hell factions; I might fix this).</div></p>

<p>It'd be interesting to see the results.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>I thought this was kind of interesting, though; is a heavily authoritarian government inherently evil, or is it just the (very real) possibility of corruption we fear? What if the supreme leader was (almost) guaranteed to have the best interests of the people in mind? Would it be so bad then?</div></p>

<p>I think this is the divide we see - residents of the lower layers are choosing to do works of law and good, while residents of the upper layers have more law and good chosen for them. This'd be distressing to a chaotic (or even neutral!) character, but the ascending petitioners have already demonstrated an escalating commitment to both ideals.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>The actual division of the layers between laisse faire capitalists and economic leftist/authoritarians then, was based more on what I thought would fit best than where they fit as rungs on the celestial ladder. Which philosophy fits better with Solania/Pistis Sophia? It just happened to be that the arrangement that worked best in my mind clustered the members of both groups together.</div></p>

<p>*nods* That makes sense, too. Keeps down infighting, keeps up cohesion between cliques, and the ultimate of law and good is neither extreme.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>On the other hand, the "enlightened despot" group (yeah, I think I really do need to at least change their name) [ETA: Please do!] does seem to be more lawful than the "free trader" group, and the layers <span style="font-style:italic">ought</span> to be getting more orderly as the lessons of the plane weed out those with more chaotic bents. Like I said, I didn't try to make them seem more good; that's harder to do anyway, especially with my cynical attitude.</div></p>

<p>*nods* We do <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> want to upset people. <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/smile.png" title="Smiling" alt="Smiling" class="smiley-content"/></p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Should they really be laisse-faire capitalists, or are they mercantilists instead? I seem to have had both ideas in my head simultaneously. Simply removing barriers that were once in place is going to itself affect the cross-planar economy significantly, but once that happens and things stabilize they're going to have less to do.</div></p>

<p>Economics is full of automatic stabilisers. There's some unfortunate consequences to some things, though. Full employment, for example, causes a lot of really bad side effects.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>[Lunia] is where the natural portals to Arcadia will be located; their influence will create places in Lunia as Arcadian as the gate-town of Fortitude, though coming from a different base reality. What I need to remind myself is that there are just as many portals to Bytopia, so there will also be places very much like Tradegate. On second thought, maybe I didn't do such a bad job with that.</div></p>

<p>Fair enough.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&quot;I&quot;</em> wrote:</div>Barachiel seems like the kind to offer export subsidies, to try to compete against extraplanar import barriers.</div>
Yeah, he does. Maybe he believes in subsidizing Celestian goods only so long as barriers exist?</div></p>

<p>That makes sense, since they're trying to set an example for the rest of the planes. Fighting with market distortions won't help anyone.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>I think what I meant to say was "fencing operations"; the halfling steal goods from the Celestians and sell them off-plane. Yeah, that's pretty different.</p>

<p>I do like the idea that the halflings sell Celestian goods in places where they might be illegal or limited. The archons would probably look at that more favorably, although deliberately allowing them to violate interplanar law makes them look bad and is against their natures.</div></p>

<p>Hmm... implications, implications.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>I'm not sure whether the "socialist" tome archons are true socialists in the Marxist sense or not; I think they might actually be. After all, if their forms of government are intended as models for the rest of the multiverse, creating self-regulating systems that don't require a perfect celestial leader in order to work is a practical goal.</div></p>

<p>*nods* That makes a lot of sense.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Perhaps they simply haven't achieved it yet, or don't believe they have.</div></p>

<p>Or maybe both. It'd be interesting to see what'd happen if an archon tried to take one of those systems elsewhere.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">
