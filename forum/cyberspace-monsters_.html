</div> <p>Persephone, I´m sorry I created no more than this...</p>

<p>-Create those f***ing infomentals... Lord, how do you get into those things...?</p>

<p>INFOMENTALS</p>

<p>Infomentals are elementals born of a recently ocurring element: information. Although they´re much newer than the other four elements, meeting one is a matter not to be taken lightly.</p>

<p>COMBAT</p>

<p>Infomentals are smarter than any other elemental type, probably because they´re literally composed of culture. Fortunately, they´re physically weaker than any other type, given that they´re made to change.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Data mastery (Ex):</span> An infomental gains a +1 insight bonus to all attack rolls made as part of a special combat action (bull rush, overrun, trip, disarm, sunder, and so on), and on opposed rolls to resist such, or against an opponent using Power Attack, Expertise, or any such ability. They suffer a -4 penalty on weapon attack and damage rolls against opponents using full attack actions without modifiers from other feats that aren´t continuously in use.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Elemental Traits (Ex):</span> Not subject to critical hits or flanking. Immune to poison, sleep effects, paralysis and stunning. Darkvision out to 60 feet. Cannot be raised nor resurrected.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">A series of free-floating greenish rectangles and blue blocks rolls in all senses near the ground.</span></p>

<p>Infomentals speak four languages, plus one language per point of intelligence bonus. They start with elemental languages, then move on to Planar Trade, following up with languages such as Undercommon, Gnome, and Celestial.</p>

<p>COMBAT<br />
For whatever godforsaken reason an infomental may enter combat, one should well be careful. They´re much more vulnerable than any other kind of elemental, but they have a correspondingly dangerous attack.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Shape Attack (Ex):</span> As a full-round action, the infomental may reshape its attack so as to better deal with its target. At the infomental´s option, it may reshape its slam to deal either slashing, piercing or bludgeoning damage until the infomental decides otherwise. Additionally, the infomental may select any of the following advantages at the same time it shapes its attack:<br />
-x4 critical multiplier.<br />
-18-20 base threat range (if the infomental has Improved Critical for his slam, the final range becomes 15-20).<br />
-+1d4 damage on each sucessful attack. This extra damage is not multiplied on a critical hit.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Embody Tool (Ex):</span> An infomental can transform itself into a useful item if it so desires. As a full-round action, an infomental can do a complex shapechange, which allows him to become any of the following:<br />
-A two-handed weapon for a creature one size bigger than itself, with the same damage and critical range of the infomental´s slam attack at the time, with an enhancement bonus equal to the infomental´s base CR (that of an untemplated, unadvanced infomental of its type) +1, divided by 2. For example, a small infomental always becomes a +1 weapon, and a greater infomental always becomes a +5 weapon.<br />
-A one-handed weapon for a creature two sizes bigger than itself, with the same damage and critical range of the infomental´s slam attack at the time, with an enhancement bonus equal to the infomental´s base CR (that of an untemplated, unadvanced infomental of its type) +1, divided by 2. For example, a small infomental always becomes a +1 weapon, and a greater infomental always becomes a +5 weapon.<br />
-An undefined tool (or set thereof), which provides a masterwork bonus on a skill the infomental posseses, equal to the infomental´s CR +1 divided by 2. The size of the user is immaterial in this case. Any pieces taken from the set dissapear if they are brought more than 30 feet from the infomental´s current space.<br />
While embodying a tool, an infomental does not threaten any spaces and cannot take any actions, except to return to its normal form (a free action).</p>

<p>NOTES: Reflex is the good save for infomentals.</p>

<p>And now, the rest of info-related beings. I´m on a creativity rush, so excuse my creationism.</p>

<p>Popups are the biggest pest in Cyberspace. More than one has taken the cause of their eradication as a way of life.<br />
Popups have only one goal in life: annoying other beings, until they give in to the demand of clicking them, and thus being transported to the popup´s target page. Unfortunately, popups are a rather old means of redirection, and pages that resort to popups are generally unworthy of any attention.<br />
The only reason popups still survive in some areas is that their target pages, dark as they are, tend to be frequented by darker beings in their most secret areas. Popups are renovated by (and at times under the protection of) such beings.<br />
Popups speak Planar Trade.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">COMBAT</span><br />
Popups first attempt parleying with any being that comes by, be it fiend or celestial, primer or anything, into touching them. They attempt their best at any cost, but they do not hesitate to enter combat should it mean being touched.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Goad (Ex):</span> A popup is skilled at convincing opponents to hit him. As a move action, a popup can goad an opponent that threatens it, has line of sight to it, can hear it, and has an intelligence score of 3 or higher (the goad is a mind-affecting ability). When the goaded opponent starts its next turn, if it still threatens, has line of sight to, and can hear the popup, it must do a Will saving throw (DC 14). If the opponent fails its saving throw, the popup is the only creature it can make melee attacks against during this turn. (If it kills the popup, knocks it unconscious, loses sight of it, or otherwise is unable to make melee attacks against it, the opponent may make any remaining melee attacks as normal) A goaded creature can still cast spells, make ranged attacks, move or perform other actions normally. The use of this feat restricts only melee attacks.<br />
The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +5 racial bonus.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Displace (Su):</span> Any creature that touches a popup, or hit by a popup´s melee slam attack, must succeed on a Will save (DC 11) or be instantly removed to the popup´s target location, if within the same plane the popup occupies. If the target location isn´t in the same place, the creature is instead sent away to a random location within 5d% miles of the popup.<br />
A weapon that deals damage to a popup is displaced immediately.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Float (Ex):</span> Popups are weightless sheets of data. They always float a foot above their ground level, and thus are unconcerned with hard terrain, and never take damage from falls. However they´re completely unable to climb more than eleven inches at a time.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Rage (Ex):</span> A popup that cannot manage to convince another creature to "click" it enters a berserk rage. In this state, it gains +4 morale bonus to strength, a +4 morale bonus to constitution, and a +2 morale bonus to Will saves, but suffers a -2 penalty to AC (all the better to touch or be clicked). While in this state, some of the popup´s abilities change:<br />
HP 13; AC 5 touch 5, flat-footed 5; Grapple +8; Atk 1 slam +3 melee 1d1+2.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">As you approach the edge of the valley, you see a massive, indescriptible object in the center of it. It seems like a metallic nightmarish vision made of pipes and light sources of all kinds.</span></p>

<p>Search engines are the most important parts of the cyberspace, redirecting continuously everything around them so as to keep their surroundings at their own frantic pace. They are almost completely omniscient.<br />
Search engines speak a minimum of 99 radically different languages each, and may also communicate telepathically. Their normal battery of languages includes all 20 languages presented in the PHB (yes, including Druidic), and a minimum of 79 area languages and obscure racial dialects.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">COMBAT</span><br />
Fighting an omniscient being seems no big task when it is harmless, but it doesn´t take into account the engine´s ability to repair its own damage at an astounding pace, nor its ability to call for aid.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Instant Research (Ex):</span> When its life is threatened, a search engine can bring into action the whole potential of its speed. This ability combines a Knowledge check boosted with Moment of Prescience, a lore check, a Vision spell, a Metafaculty manifestation and a Gather Information check as a standard action. Assume the engine will know everything about a character when attacked.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Lore (Ex):</span> A search engine can use the lore ability of a 18th level bard at will, and gains a +4 insight bonus on this check.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Unmoving (Ex):</span> A search engine cannot move at all. It suffers AC penalties as if it had a dexterity score of 0, and an additional -5 AC penalty, as per an unattended, immobile object. It is also immune to bull rush or trip attempts.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Impossible Mind (Ex):</span> A search engine has deadly currents of thought in its mind. Anybody attempting to contact the search engine mentally without the engine´s knowledge must succeed on a Will save (DC 32) or have its own mind torn off in the torrent of information and shredded to bits (literally), effectively dying. This is a mind-affecting effect.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Spell-trigger-like abilities (Sp):</span> at will- quickened <span style="font-style:italic">discern location</span>, quickened <span style="font-style:italic">moment of prescience</span>, quickened <span style="font-style:italic">vision</span>, quickened <span style="font-style:italic">demand</span>.

<span style="font-weight:bold">Multispell/Multimanifestation (Sp):</span> The search engine can cast five quickened spells (or engage five quickened powers) per round as a free action.

<p>Antivirii (the plural of antivirus) are artificial outsiders that have as their life mission the eradication of all virii.<br />

An antivirus stands about 6 feet tall and weighs nearly 180 pounds.</p>

<p>COMBAT<br />
Antivirii have no sense of honor, since they know their foes won´t care about that. They never care, either, if any other creature is hurt; they live to hunt virii. They have no qualms against ambushing, or escaping if things go bad.<br />
Typically, they attempt to sneak on a virus to catch it flat-footed, then using their Power Attack feat impunely with both weapons at -4/+8 damage. After that, they cleave on to the next virus, and sneak back away to repeat the strategy.<br />
If forewarned, they forearm themselves, like anyone smart enough: they cast shield and invisibility to start up.<br />

<span style="font-style:italic">This being has a small red light on its forehead.</span></p>

<p>A virtokhut is an inevitable created to work with computers, and in them, attempt to simulate and improve upon inevitable programming and (why not?) design.<br />
Virtokhuts are dry, humorless creatures, unwilling to engage in chitchat. Sometimes they perform functions that other inevitables are sent because of: they can be trackers for bargain-breakers or undead, while they keep working for Mechanus through the planarnet.<br />
A virtokhut is a little over 6 feet tall, and weighs, despite its metallic yet gaunt build, 200 pounds.</p>

<p>COMBAT<br />
Virtokhuts shun combat. If forced to fight, they retreat at the first chance possible. They leave the fighting to constructs they make by themselves, which they command through infrareds.<br />
If their infrareds are broken, virtokhuts resort to slamming a foe in an attempt to stun it, then running away.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Infrareds (Ex):</span> Virtokhuts have a small light in their foreheads that allows them to emit infrared signals. Using those signals, they can control anything subject to infrared signals. It is presumed they can even control pacemakers, but this is unfounded.<br />
If a construct is made so as to accept infrared signals (and most of the time, virtokhuts add one even when it isn´t needed), the virtokhut can control the construct directly and personally, adding onto it the following benefits as long as the virtokhut concentrates on controlling it (a move action each round) and keeps line of sight to the construct:<br />
-Once per round, when it is attacked, the construct may replace its AC with a Computer Use check from the virtokhut.<br />
-The construct adds the virtokhut´s intelligence bonus to its attack and damage rolls.<br />
The red light may be attacked with a sunder attempt, but that provokes an attack of opportunity from the virtokhut: its AC is 28, it has a hardness of 8, and 2 hit points. <br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Interrupt (Ex):</span> A virtokhut´s blows have an added electrical charge that causes problems to most living beings. Although this electricity deals no damage, the virtokhut has a chance to stun any creature on a sucessful hit.<br />
Any living creature hit by a virtokhut´s slam must succeed on a Fort Save (DC 21) or be stunned for 1 round. The save DC is intelligence-based.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">*skills:</span> Virtokhuts gain skill points as if they were outsiders instead of constructs.</p>

<p>Navis are the manifestation of people outside of Cyberspace when they decide to enter it. They normally send a representing program, a kind of alter ego, into the net. The person in the real world becomes the operator, whilst the program becomes its eyes and ears (and hands) in cyberworld.<br />
Navis speak the same languages that their operators, and Planar Trade.</p>

<p>COMBAT<br />
Navis fight a lot, against virii for example. In any case, they don´t have any problem to enter combat... against foes they know they can defeat. Against other foes, they might attempt to parley first.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Buster (Ex):</span> A navi has a natural weapon that involves transforming one of their arms into a buster. This is a ranged weapon with a range increment of 30 feet that deals 1d4 base damage.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Synchro (Ex):</span> A trained operator can get more of a navi. Some navi are customized, for example, but real synchro is beyond that. If the operator has synchro feats, he might awaken greater powers in a navi. Those powers are described in synchro feats, below.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Planar Commitment (Ex):</span> For all the power they might be awakened, navis face one little problem: they´re stuck in Cyberworld forever.</p>

<p>(Honestly, I don´t like these navis.)</p>

<p>Free-Functioning Protocol (CR 17): Rumoured to be each a unique program, they seek out and retrieve or destroy specific data packets.</p>

<p>Virii (CR 3-7): Those small buggers stop areas of cyberspace from functioning correctly until destroyed.<br />
Virus types:<br />
-Romulus (all paths lead to Rome): This virus changes links to lead to certain places. It punctures holes on its foes.<br />
-Worm (Why reinvent the wheel?): This virus spreads junk data to corrupt computers. Once it spreads enough data, the computer may not work at all. It attacks with a sticky strand, and smashing with its tail.<br />
-Furnoid (Nothing´s worth in Cyberspace): This virus erases data it finds functioning.<br />
-Sujack (Lumbering beast for anyone): This huge mole with a greataxe finds and destroys entire computer functions.<br />
-Spyware (to keep some names easy): Those sniping virii seek out information within others´ computers.<br />
-Plague (Because they were necessary too): Those codes have the undead (extraplanar) type. They are the result of unbridled viral activity, and nest unborn virii.</p>

<p>Romulus virii are stinkier, bileful and less savory versions of popups.<br />
A normal Romulus virus stands over 5 feet tall thanks to its hunched build, and weighs like 300 pounds.<br />
Romulus virii can speak Planar Trade, but prefer Abyssal, Draconic or Infernal.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Combat</span><br />
Romulus virii attempt to kill any witnesses of them working, and also wait at the target places to kill those that have witnessed their handiwork at the link. This could lead to ridiculous situations if the link´s result is a well-populated place, since those creatures are solitary by nature.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Bleeding wound (Ex):</span> A romulus virus that hits with a claw attack creates a wound that stays bleeding for a long time. Until the application of either a DC 15 heal check, any spell that restores hit point damage, or the transformation of the damaged creature into another form, the wound deals one extra point of damage every round. Unlike other creatures with similar abilities, a romulus virus doesn´t cause multiple damage by causing multiple bleeding wounds.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Limited Hack (Ex):</span> Romulus virii are able to hack into links or portals, making them lead somewhere else if they so desire. Treat this as the ability to change a portal´s destination to one predetermined that varies by individual romulus, except that it is possible to see whether a portal has been hacked with a DC 18 Computer Use check. The save DC is Charisma-based and includes a +4 racial bonus.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Pounce (Ex):</span> If a romulus charges in the first round of combat, it can make a full attack at the end of a charge. Only one of its attacks gets the charge bonus, though.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">*Skills:</span> A romulus has a +4 racial bonus on listen and spot checks.</p>

<p>Worm virii are somewhat advanced worms that rely on their ability to replicate things to slow down and finally stop computers.<br />
Worm virii speak Planar Trade (or common, or binary).<br />
A normal worm virus is 15 feet long and weighs almost 1.000 pounds.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">COMBAT</span><br />
The typical worm virus tries to attack from ambush, shooting silk from its rifle end, then vanishing into the shadows. While those with the sprayed being are helping it, the worm tries to spray more of them. Once half the group is sprayed, the worm overruns a melee combatant, and then proceeds to hit it.<br />
At times, if given (or interrupted at) some time, the worm can throw a silk-covered being as a grenadelike weapon.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Overrun:</span> Opposed strength check. The worm has a +9 overrun midifier on this check, +11 on a charge.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Shoot Silk (Ex):</span> The worm virus can shoot silk on a target as a ranged touch attack (+6 attack bonus) up to five times per day. A target that is hit becomes entangled.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Spray Silk (Ex):</span> The worm virus can spray silk over an area as a breath weapon, up to five times per day. All targets in a 10-foot cone must succeed on a reflex save (DC 16), or become entangled. A target that is already entangled becomes immobilized.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Toss (Ex):</span> An immobilized victim may be used as a toy by the worm, which enjoys throwing things far, far away. As a standard action, a worm virus can throw a foe of medium-size or smaller against two adjacent squares, dealing a base 2d6+5 damage, plus 1d6 per every 200 pounds the target weighs, to all the contents on the square (Refl DC 15 negates). The maximum weight it can negotiate in this way are 400 pounds. The maximum range it can negotiate are 50 feet, and its ranged attack bonus in this form is +2 (Remember, though, squares have AC 10). The save DC does not vary for stronger or weaker worms.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">*skills:</span> Worm virii have a -8 racial penalty to Jump checks, and a +8 racial bonus to climb checks. They may always choose to take 10 on a climb check, even if rushed or threatened.</p>

<p>Sujacks are virii created to destroy places in cyberworld.<br />
Unlike most other virii, sujacks are cunning beasts, often with goals of their own, which may or may not conflict with their creator´s. They know enough to be aware keeping such things secret is the norm by excellence, but they have a villain´s drive to gloat sometimes.<br />
Sujacks speak Planar trade, Infernal, Abyssal, Binary and Draconic.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">COMBAT</span><br />
Sujacks relish melee chances as much as the following, although their ability at it might not be as great as they think. Normally they try to sunder an opponent´s weapons first, and keep the casters down with shockwaves.<br />
A sujack´s DR is an extraordinary ability.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Shockwave (Ex):</span> A sujack can raise its tail and lower it as a full-round action, sending a shockwave along the ground. Any creature stepping on the same ground as the sujack within a 60 foot radius must succeed on a DC 24 Reflex save, or be tripped. The save DC is strength-based.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Grinding Bite (Su):</span> A sujack can use its otherwise harmless bite to destroy buildings. As a full-round action, a sujack can hold its teeth to a wall, and wave its tail. This attack deals 10d10 damage to the wall, ignoring hardness, in a shockwave channeled with its whole body.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Adamantine Claws (Ex):</span> A sujack´s claws ignore the hardness of any object they strike.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Fissure (Sp):</span> When a sujack has finally claimed an area (i.e. destroying all resistance), it normally follows with destroying the boot record (thus disabling access to the data from any other plane). As a side effect, the ground in the area is cracked, alongside all buildings, as if an <span style="font-style:italic">earthquake</span> spell had been cast. A sujack can use a fissure prematurely, but this is a spell-like ability that takes three consecutive full-round actions... not recommended in the presence of adventurers.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">This being looks like a pile of diverse materials, held together fast by a pale yellow substance. It moves towards you without any hurry.</span></p>

<p>Plague virii are specialized forms of virii, created not to destroy, but to corrupt codes. In a way, they are more dangerous than mere destroyers, since the corruption they cause can´t be healed by merely destroying them.<br />
Plague virii don´t deign themselves to speak, not even among themselves. If magically coaxed, they can handle Planar Trade.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">COMBAT</span><br />
Plague virii aren´t particularly deadly combatants, but unless they are handled quickly, they can become slowly more and more deadly, as random starts playing in their favor if it didn´t before.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Corrupt Code (Su):</span> A blow from a plague against a creature in Cyberworld can cause the target to swiftly become another plague virus. A creature hit by a plague must succeed on a DC 9 Fortitude save or start being assimilated by the plague. Unless a creature manages to control the effect (see below), it swiftly becomes another virus. The save DC is Charisma-based.<br />
An afflicted character feels searing pain coursing along the nerves, so strong the victim cannot act coherently. The victim cannot cast spells, manifest powers, or use magic items, and he attacks blindly, unable to distinguish friend from foe (-4 attack penalty and 50% miss chance, regardless of the attack roll result).<br />
Each round the victim stays in the effect deals it 1 point of constitution drain, as its shape slowly melts into a pile of greenish blocks, blue orbs, red cones, and more color-coded shapes, all of them dripping a pale yellow substance.<br />
A victim can try to hold together by making a DC 15 Charisma check (this DC doesn´t change with different plague virii; it represents something entirely out of their control). A sucess halts the effects for 24 hours. On a failure, the victim can keep trying each round until it succeeds (or dies).<br />
Corruption isn´t a curse or a disease, and so it is hard to remove. A <span style="font-style:italic">polymorph, alter self,</span> or <span style="font-style:italic">shapechange</span> spell fixes the target´s form for the duration of the effect. A restoration, heal, or greater restoration spell removes the affliction. In any case, leaving the cyberworld removes the affliction, and all damage it dealt is immediately healed.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Corrupted Code (Su):</span> Each plague virus once contained a code (and most of it is the aforementioned code still). Each plague virus retains either a bonus feat, special attack, or special quality from the subject it was created from. However, since the kept part of the plague is so small, plague virii are considered a different creature and not a template. Using this ability, if a special attack, also adds the Corrupt Code Special Attack to its damage.<br />
The plague virus presented here is an "ideal" plague virus: it keeps no abilities.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">DATA CREATURE</span><br />
Beings programmed for existence in Cyberspace, those are created counterparts of "normal" creatures.<br />
A data creature looks normal, except for that its eyes are green, and any edge it has posesses an unnatural, subtle green tinge. In rare cases, those marked edges have some shine.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">CREATING A DATA CREATURE</span><br />
"Data creature" is an inherited template that can be added to any creature, herreafter referred to as "eidolon". The data creature uses the same stats as the base creature, except as presented here:<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Size and Type:</span> Size is unchanged. Type changes to Outsider (Extraplanar, augmented [original type])<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Speed:</span> Land speed increases by 10 ft.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Special Attacks:</span> Data creatures gain two special attacks: Shape attack, Augment Critical, and True Strike.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Shape Attack:</span> A data creature is culture incarnate, and as such, it is capable of doing impensable shifts to its structure. As a full-round action, a data creature can select one of its natural attacks, and if it deals slashing, bludgeoning or piercing damage, choose one of the aforementioned types of damage for it to deal from now on. Whenever it desires, it may take another full-round action to change damage type again.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">True Strike:</span></span> Once per day, a data creature can cast <span style="font-style:italic">True Strike</span>, with a caster level equal to its hit die.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Augment Critical:</span> Using a similar technique to its Shape Attack, a data creature can augment its criticals if it so chooses. As a full-round action as well, it may select one of those qualities to add to one of its natural weapons:<br />
- 18-20 critical range.<br />
- x4 critical multiplier.<br />
- No criticals. The weapon deals no increased damage from a critical hit, but its automatically deals 1d4 extra damage with every hit.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Special Qualities:</span> A data creature gains the following special quality: Embody tool.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Embody Tool (Su):</span> As a full-round action, a data creature can become an advanced masterwork tool. In doing so, it chooses one skill it has, and becomes a tool that provides a [(Data Creature´s CR +1)/2, maximum +6] bonus on the skill to another creature.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Data commitment (Ex):</span> A data creature cannot leave the Cyberspace.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Outsider Traits:</span> Can´t be raised nor resurrected, darkvision 60 ft., proficient with simple and martial weapons, doesn´t require food or rest.<br />

<p><span style="font-style:italic">This plated bull-like creature is covered in dusky, metallic scales. It has silvery horns, but there´s something like a greenish tinge on its eyes and edges of the scales that shouldn´t be there.</span></p>

<p>A typical gorgon stands over 6 feet tall at the shoulder and measures 8 feet from snout to tail. It weighs about 4,000 pounds.<br />
Gorgons are nothing if not aggressive. They attack intruders on sight, attempting to trample, gore, or petrify them. There is no way to calm these furious creatures, and they are impossible to domesticate.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">COMBAT</span><br />
Whenever possible, a gorgon begins an encounter by charging at its opponents. Cybergorgons are slightly more intelligent, but not much more willing to tolerate intruders. They typically trample first and ask later, since they consider that something unable to survive a trample doesn´t really warrant their attention. However, they don´t show nor ask for quarter when outnumbered.<br />
Prior to Combat: Keep critical augmented to x4.<br />
Round 1: Trample target (from ambush if possible)<br />
Round 2: Grapple target, ask its business (Diplomacy DC 25 to make it indifferent to passage; -10 to make as a full-round action; Concentration DC 20 to do grappled)<br />
Round 3: If the target cannot convince the cybergorgon to let go, breath weapon (standard action), followed by withdrawing motion (move action).<br />
Round 4: If the target survives the breath weapon, charge.<br />
Round 5: If the target doesn´t show much strain from being charged nor stepped on, shape attack to slashing damage (unless it seems obvious it <br />
won´t do), and attempt to identify whether the target is fortified/immune to critical hits (in such a case, shape as well +1d4 to damage instead of x4 damage).</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Breath Weapon (Su):</span> 60-foot cone, once every 1d4 rounds (but no more than five times per day), turn to stone permanently, Fortitude DC 19 negates. The save DC is Constitution-based.<br />

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Preternatural code template</span><br />
Preternatural codes are rare beings from Cyberspace, capable of affecting areas outside of the reality it belongs to. They come from a variety of backgrounds, but their abilities are universally feared.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Creating a preternatural code</span><br />
"Preternatural code" is a template that can be added to any creature from Cyberspace, in lieu or together with "data creature". Add the following special attack to its abilities:<br />

<span style="font-weight:bold">Preternatural attack (Su):</span> A preternatural code is dangerous beyond belief, for its abilities can cross the boundaries of Cyberspace.

<p>I´m deeply sorry for limiting myself to this, Persephone, but it´s as far as I go... I think I´m starting to get weary...</p>

<p>...Cyberspace format as a drug...</p>

<p>Drugs are similar to diseases, except that upon contact, instead of a save to decide infection, there are two saves to resist its effects (one for the initial, and one for the secondary). Someone who intentionally enters Cyberspace fails automatically both saves; the DC listed is only for those unwillingly dragged into Cyberworld. It isn´t possible, for example, to decide failing the first save and then try to resist the second one, nor vice versa. Side effects are automatic.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Cyberspace:</span> This is the effect of mere bodily exposition to Cyberspace.<br />
<span style="font-style:italic">Initial Effect:</span> If the character fails his first save upon immediate exposition, he suffers an insight penalty to Wisdom equal to 1d4 points. Multiple penalties of the same kind don´t stack.<br />
<span style="font-style:italic">Secondary Effect:</span> If the character fails his second save upon immediate exposition, the free-flowing information within Cyberspace flows through the character´s mind, granting him a +4 insight bonus to Intelligence for the duration of his exposition (for almost anyone, this should be more than enough to answer anything).<br />
<span style="font-style:italic">Side Effects:</span> Questions are endless despite however much information one takes. Following the disconnection, the character must succeed on a Will save (DC 17), or start planning his next foray into the Cyberspace (in my case. In yours, you might want to return immediately...).<br />
<span style="font-style:italic">Overdose:</span> None; Cyberspace, unlike most drugs, is continuously taken.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Special:</span> Cyberspace exposition works differently from most diseases. It takes a Will save, not a Fortitude save, to resist its effects. It´s also a mind-affecting, language-dependant effect (thus, creatures with intelligence scores below 3 are unaffected, as well as mindless creatures). The damage per day unless re-exposed is 1d3-2 Dex (can be 0 damage). The Will save DC to resist Cyberspace´s influence is 4.</p>       </div>

         <p>Replaced the post by a shorter one. That way we´ll get something readable.<br />
And removed the sblock tags.</p>

<p>EDIT: Oh, gory hell... Why is it that it still doesn´t fit?</p>

<p>Well, I´ll have to make room. No more visual constructions: these´ll be posted down there. As well as my own rants as I did those things.<br />
And the synchro feats.</p>

<p>-----</p>

<p>INFOMENTALKIN</p>

<p>Just as fire elementals are not the only elementals out there, data elementals aren´t alone either.</p>

<p>Data Mephit (CR 3): Those pesky, curious creatures have the ability to detect their foes´ thoughts, and breathe out shards of random material.<br />
Popup (CR 2): This bothersome being has the ability to displace its targets with a slam. It uses the Goad feat.<br />
Search Engine (CR 15): This colossal monstrousity can cast a quickened <span style="font-style:italic">discern location</span> spell at will, up to three times per round.<br />
Virii (CR 3-7): Those small buggers stop areas of cyberspace from functioning correctly until destroyed.<br />
Antivirus (CR 3): This being is a single-minded viral destroyer.<br />
Free-Functioning Protocol (CR 17): Rumoured to be each a unique program, they seek out and retrieve or destroy specific data packets.</p>

<p>Data creature (Template): This otherwise normal creature exists only in Cyberspace.<br />
Preternatural code (Template): Such a virus or program could cross the boundaries of possibility and become a danger even outside of cyberspace.<br />
Code Interphase (CR 7): This unassuming being compiles codes to make them function, and can create other infomentalkin or even infomentals.</p>

<p>18-20/x4 = 24<br />
19-20/x3 = 23<br />
   20/x2 = 22</p>

<p>A x4 2-h trip 4.5 (1d8)<br />
A 19 2-h -    7   (2d6)</p>

<p>Critical utility  Hands Maneuvers Damage  Dam type<br />
3                  2     1        4.5         2    = 12.5<br />
2                  2     0        7           1    = 12</p>

<p>I think this is enough to do it!</p>

<p>Recalling the most basic elemental data...<br />
Small: 2 HD, CR 1<br />
Medium: 4 HD, CR 3<br />
Large: 8 HD, CR 5<br />
Huge: 16 HD, CR 7<br />
Greater: 21 HD, CR 9<br />
Elder: 24 HD, CR 11</p>

<p>Recreating data-based abilities...<br />
Since those beings are made of bits and odds of culture, I´d say their mastery should come in anything but plain combat. A standard, dumb fighter would earn more of his share of protagonism against an infomental.</p>

<p>Creating a weapon...<br />
Incarnum would perhaps suit them on this one... no. I´d better keep to what I thought.</p>

<p>Creating details...<br />
Water elementals would be perhaps the most likely to have their movement mimicked... but how? No, fire elementals would be best. 50 feet until huge, 60 feet from there on.<br />
Natural armor... would have to wait. The thickest one is from the earth elemental, ranging from +7 to +15. The thinnest ones are fire and air, from +3 to +8. Since I´m not making plushie elementals or titanium elementals, I think I´ll go with the weakest one. But they´ll be swift guys.<br />
Special attacks, you ask? Well, data is supposed to make the difference quite swiftly. A high critical rate would do... varying from elemental to elemental, of course.<br />
Special qualities are going to give me a high harder time. Luckily elemental traits and the fixed DR are here, and since fire elementals are the only ones to break said mold, it´s here where mine won´t.<br />
Only one thing remains. Abilities and feats, the hardest part!<br />
Observing a bit the ol´ elementals, I see that hae transition from small to elder increases one of their ability scores by 16 points. Siiiick. Wow, I´m writing with my eyes closed! Can you believe it??? Oh my god, well, let´s get back to business.<br />
Infomentals will use standard physical ability scores for their size, and improve their mental ones. I´d make them unwise, but that´s what the modrons are, so I´d better try to find a way to say that PCs are wise, or charismatic in a way...<br />
Anyway... I imagine their intelligence will run from 16 (small) to 26 (elder), but no. I want those guys to be something mind flayers themselves can and will envy... 18 to 28, then? Wisdom and Charisma better stay 10, then, like all elementals... now only Strength, Dexterity and Constitution will haunt me. I´d better keep them about standard for creatures of their size... Dexterity a bit higher and Constitution a bit lower, Strength normal. NO! When has an elemental had a low constitution? Lower strength, then.<br />
Finally their feat selection. Only PHB and MM1 stuff, I promise, because they´ll be deadly enough with their special slam attack I´m designing.</p>

<p>Str 8, Dex 12, Con 12,<br />
Str 10, Dex 14, Con 14, <br />
Str 12, Dex 16, Con 16, <br />
Str 18, Dex 18, Con 18, <br />
Str 22, Dex 18, Con 20, <br />
Str 24, Dex 18, Con 22, </p>

<p>However, it seems that giving them a constitution of 22 outstrips even the Earth elementals. So I´ll keep it down to 18.</p>

<p>Synchro feats:<br />
Synchro feats represent a deepening connection between a person and a navi, such a connection that starts trascending the limits of nature (and cyberspace, and more than often, the villain´s patience, or even others´ patience).<br />
Synchro feats grant a navi greater powers when the operator controls him directly, but the feats must be taken by an operator. As such, they´re kinda rare.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Augmented Navi [Synchro]</span><br />
Your skill at programming has led you to develop new ways to strengthen your navi.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Prerequisites:</span> Computer use 5 ranks.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Benefit:</span> Your navi gains a +4 enhancement bonus on its Strength and Constitution score.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Digitalized Constructions [Synchro]</span><br />
Your skill at programming allows you to create digital versions of items.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Prerequisites:</span> Computer use 8 ranks.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Benefit:</span> Your navi can use your equipment as if it had a copy of it. However, at the start of every day, you must spend 15 minutes reprogramming and debugging, because bugs are always ready to eat at magic data.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Advanced Defense [Synchro]</span><br />
You know how to protect your navi well.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Prerequisites:</span> Computer Use 1 rank.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Benefit:</span> Once per round when your navi would be hit in combat, you may do a computer use check. If your check result is greater than the attack roll of the offender, you may negate all of the attack´s effects.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Heartfold protection [Synchro]</span><br />
Your deepening connection to your navi protects it with all your heart.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Prerequisites:</span> Cha 15.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Benefit:</span> Your navi gains your charisma bonus on all its saving throws.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Special:</span> This doesn´t stack with the Divine Grace ability, or similars.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Navi familiar [Synchro]</span><br />
Your familiar is on the net.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Prerequisites:</span> Familiar ability, Computer Use 4 ranks.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Benefit:</span> Your selected navi gains benefits as if it was your familiar.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Soul Synchro [Synchro]</span><br />
Your navi and you are one forevermore.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Prerequisites:</span> Character level 6th.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Benefit:</span> Your navi shares your stats, with the exception that it has two negative levels.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Full Synchro [Synchro]</span><br />
Your navi and you are no longer two creatures, but even then more than one. When you two are together, no one may stand before you.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Prerequisites:</span> Character level 9th, Soul Synchro.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Benefit:</span> The shared stats from Soul Synchro no longer invoke two negative levels on your navi.</p>

<p>(Visual construction: The wolf that fed Romulus (Rome´s [City in Italy. All paths lead to it, according to the saying] mythical founder) was female... a total b*tch. And well, something that always finds home? A homing pigeon. But wing muscles are on the upper torso: that´s why birds have those edible muscles, whose names I don´t recall now, on the breast. It had to look obsessed (sewn eyes), and the anklets... I had been toying with the idea that it could extend and retract its legs, depending on the direction it was headed (always longer strides towards its target area). But I decided to just make it fast, and leave them for my own sick hubris.)<br />
(Visual construction: I first added the worm thing because one shouldn´t reinvent the wheel. Worms are worms, and that´s as classic as the golem. Then decided to make it out of something that´s bothersome: beachballs! The shiny dots are eyes, because outsiders need their darkvision, and the small rifle mouth is because it needed to be a bit more threatening with all the weirdness. Finally the wig... it needed something useless, because a worm´s function is self-replication and weighing as much as possible on the systems, without weighing itself down)<br />
(no visual construction... I really didn´t know why to make those.)<br />
(Visual construction: At first, I wanted to call them "slumbers", because they´re made to damage boot records [you know, that thing that makes the PC start working in the first place]. And then I thought "lumberjacks", because they land thy PC like a falling log. Well, a slumbering lumberjack... a slumberjack? No, it was too stupid. Sujack, that´s it. The lumber part stays with the axe, and they have mole shapes because I wanted them to be damaging to the foundations of buildings. The beaver´s tail is there only for the attack it has, since a 10 HD outsider can´t be respected if all it does is melee combat... and because I wanted them to, in all ways possible, be earth-shaking beings. As for the helmet... I don´t know.)</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>I haven't had a chance to read through in much detail yet, but it looks to be much with the good. And, really, if you're feeling that terribly bad about not having done much, please do feel free to create more. <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/lol.png" title="Laughing out loud" alt="Laughing out loud" class="smiley-content"/></p>

<p>I'll make some time to read through it soon-ish, and I'll give you a better response then, but it looks fairly good from what I've looked at thus far.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Well, thank you all... yet I doubt this is the right flavor. I don´t want to see two days of work go to the trashcan, but to tell you the truth, I feel like the first time I came to this place to harass Shemeska (back then I was a flamer  :cry:  believe in redemption, it exists). I´ve got kinda a bit sense of the planes in myself now,<br />
but in cyberspace, I´m so far completely clueless. What flavor do we want to give it? Else, we could merely use the rules for a bunch of demiplanes, or a theoretical space that connects them. You know, like the unexplored Ordial Plane.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">
