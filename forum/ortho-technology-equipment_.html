Last update: Added 'Kersh'</span></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Some nips and tucks here, and slight change in tone. I’m sensitive to Charles’ concerns about creating a ‘steampunk’ feel (even though I think some of it’s probably inevitable given the magic heavy/physics light nature of D&amp;D); I have eased back on some of the weirder stuff and its availability. There are exceptions, but that’s my general strategy. In general, I’m going to maintain a more realistic tone by sticking to ‘real world’ technology when possible. I’ve also lowered our estimated tech level a little, roughly to Stewart/Edwardian with exceptions for the classic D&amp;D traditions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-weight:bold">Magic &amp; Technology in the Pax Harmonium</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">In examining the advancement of our economic and social strength to its current prosperity, a scholar cannot overlook the importance of the two primary inventions of the Second Harmony: The press-print machine and the personal eye lens. </p>

<p>The effect of the press-print machine can be seen throughout our great society – the benefit of accurate and standard records, of mass-produced missives without the error and deviation inevitable from the use of scribes and copyists, and the social benefit of freely available literature. Citizens from Heka to Motmurk to the Flamedance Mountains can read exactly the same information, in the same language, at the same time; free from local ambiguities. Even those who would abuse such technology for subversion of our great agenda cannot doubt its power.</p>

<p>The effect of the eye-lens or ‘ocular’ is as simple as it is elegant: In previous centuries, craftsmen in as diverse fields as clockwork machinery, jewellery, or the simple but essential pin-making could labour only until their eyesight began to fail; but with the use of oculars and the increased frequency of magelight over candle and lamp, these ageing craftsmen – often masters of their art – were able to continue in their chosen profession for many more years, creating innumerable masterworks of art and invention for the betterment of our society. </p>

<p>- From “An examination of the prosperity of the modern age"</span></p>

<p>Ortho has made some amazing advances in technology under the Pax Harmony. Works physical, alchemical, and magical. In almost every industry production has been mechanised and brought the benefits of mass-production; Press-print machines have brought literacy to the masses and a single unified language; Refined coals and alchemical liquids feed steam engines and giant mechanical tools doing the work of many hands with a single operator; Trade itself has become the concern of a unified world that’s connected by Knights’ Roads, canals, shipping lanes both across the sea and through the air, and the strong backs of mules and labourers. </p>

<p>As national borders became less defined and excise procedures became unified and simpler, international trade flourished. The Orthorian Central Authority balanced the books of once-rival nations, making each Province dependent on the well-being of its neighbours. Knowledge and technology spread alongside the cause of Harmony, and the new world peace brought other benefits too: bandits and brigands could no longer hide in border regions or under the protection of enemy states. Epidemics of disease were restricted and eliminated using methods and personnel from far beyond infected areas. The population swelled, but so did demand for new goods and services - wealth increased as merchants travelled freely and unafraid, and tolls and tariffs were reduced on respectable and necessary goods. Money flowed into almost all levels of society. </p>

<p>Hundreds of years of peace and cooperation brought developments in agriculture, mass production, smelting and heavy engineering, printing and literacy, transport infrastructure, and military technology. Harmonium tutors spread the word in ‘Technological Harmony Programs’ that reached the farthest shores of the empire. Natural magic may have waned with the rise of technology, but alchemical treatments, crop rotation, and specially engineered food-strains replaced the fey blessings and druidic rituals of earlier centuries. </p>

<p>The OCA also introduced mechanical clocks, unified calendars, and accurate almanacs to bring standardised time and date to all Ortho’s inhabitants (GHT, or ‘Global Harmonised Time’). At first the strange new artefacts and devices were viewed as sorcerous wonders, with whole villages gathering to watch their arrival and installation. Now the chime of public clocks are as natural-seeming as birdsong to the populace. Indeed, modern philosophers are claiming that the people of Ortho are losing their ability to tell the time by the sun’s arc and other natural cues.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div><span style="font-weight:bold">Sidebar: Global Harmonised Time </span></p>

<p>GHT is the standard time on Ortho, based on the time in Harmony’s Glory. Every hour on Ortho has the same number and is of the same length – although the actual ‘time of day’ varies depending on global location (when it’s noon in Harmony’s Glory it is still early morning in Voll for example). Most Provinces also use local time, officially called ‘Harmonised Provincial Time’ despite the OCA having tried consistently to discourage this practice for years. </p>

<p>Because of this variation, most hours also have a name in the common tongue. The ‘Clattering Hour’ for example, is five hours before dawn regardless of whether that’s the 5th Hour GHT (Harmony’s Glory) or the 11th Hour GHT (which is five hours before dawn in Voll). See ‘Life in the Pax Harmonium’ for more information on the named hours.</div></p>

<p>Encouraged by the work ethic of state and temple, the rising merchant class developed a strong belief in progress, technology, and hard work. These beliefs cross-pollinated into the civil service as well, alongside the strong Harmonium ethic. The increased population was swiftly put to work building roads, clearing land for farms (and working them), constructing the new cities, or marching in the red plate armour of the ever-growing army. A core aim of the OCA was to keep its workers paid and occupied, which has resulted in some staggeringly massive works of civil engineering – sometimes needless, but always impressive. </p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-weight:bold">Orthorian Equipment &amp; Services </span></span></p>

<p>Although the Pax Harmonium has produced its share of great inventors, officially the OCA sees innovation solely as a means of producing stability and productivity. The world government is very skilled in utilising technology, but not a great sponsor of innovation for its own sake: World-changing inventions inevitably cause disruption and chaos, after all. Each department of the OCA has its own bureau of technology review, which finances research and development, analyses the impact of new technology, and sees that each innovation is distributed steadily and with foresight across the whole of Ortho. Attitudes vary from bureau to bureau - from hostile and reactionary to open and enthusiastic – but in general the OCA prefers a measured trickle of new technology, allowing society plenty of time to adjust. The Octave is perfectly prepared to use economic and legal means to enforce its will, much to the chagrin of inventors and potential user’s alike. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Ortho Equipment List</span></p>

<p>More than a few inventions have become synonymous with the Pax Harmonium, for good or ill. Rolling fortresses, the steamhorse, the clackharp mechanical loom; these are all icons of the age – held up as examples by both the state and its detractors. Other advances are seemingly less impressive but no less ubiquitous, like the humble umbrella or the tiny but significant ocular. </p>

<p>Many inventions are banned or restricted by the OCA for reasons of security or social impact; others are simply restricted to those who have proved to be responsible – effectively ‘OCA or Harmonium personnel only.’ Sometimes goods and services are given a higher classification to discourage their use or monitor those who chose to partake of them. Classifications are as follows (these classifications are also used for spells):</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic"><span style="font-weight:bold">Class A: </span>Legal and harmless<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Class B:</span> Legal (may be used in the course of committing a misdemeanour)<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Class C: </span>Controlled (requires license to own, use, craft, or teach) <br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Class D:</span> Restricted (this usually means ‘Harmonium/OCA personnel only’) <br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Class E:</span> Forbidden </span></p>

<p>Typical Class E goods include ivory from the intelligent races of Intagril, various harmful drugs, ‘chaotic’ magical items like Wands of Wander, and certain texts, both secular and religious. </p>

<p>The Harmonium also has a ‘disapproval list’ of goods which are subject to punitive tariffs and limitations designed to discourage the consumption of an otherwise legal good or service; the various businesses of the Licensed Quarter being a prime example.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold"><span style="font-size:18px">Armour </span></span></p>

<p>Orthorian armour follows the same basic pattern as elsewhere, save that Harmonium-issue items are almost always painted or lacquered in their traditional red. It can be quite difficult to find commercial armourer in some places (especially central urban areas); it’s the Harmonium who are supposed to be protecting the populace after all – why would anyone else need heavy armour?</p>

<p>Demonslayer Plate armour was introduced during the War of Iron, specifically for use against the abyssal hordes. It is actually based on armour designs first used against the fey in the War of Harmony, but refined with another four centuries of experience and technology. In addition to the special materials below, the armour is bedecked with holy icons and symbols of the Lords of Order. </p>

<p>Demonslayer plate is crafted from adamantine, and grants the wearer Damage Reduction 3/- in addition to the statistics above. A combination of special materials, techniques, and the all-encompassing nature of the armour grant the wearer a +2 bonus to all saving throws versus physically damaging magical attacks, gas attacks, and similar physical effects. The wearer suffers a -4 penalty to Spot, Search, and Listen checks while wearing the armour however. Removing the helmet negates these penalties but reduces the AC protection by 2pts and also negates the save bonus. The armour has Hardness 20 and 65 hit points. </p>

<p>Lacquered in gleaming Harmonium red, those armoured in demonslayer plate resemble spiky celestial lobsters rather than men. Although heavy and highly cumbersome, it is said that there is not even space for a pin to be pushed between the heavy overlapping plates. As well as containing integral armoured pouches, the suit is studded with cold iron armour spikes of masterwork quality, and the armour’s gauntlets may also be used as lock gauntlets.<br />

<p>The Ogre Jack has become synonymous with its namesake: It consists of a rough, tough jacket and trousers made from thick leather and cord, worn primarily by labour clan ogres and other hard-working types. Although more cumbersome than standard leather armour, it has the advantage of not being seen as ‘real armour’ and so can be worn around town without too much trouble. </p>

<p>The above version is sized for a Large creature. A human-sized version is only half the cost and weight. </p>

<p>The Rake’s Vest is a common accoutrement worn by the well to do in the Licensed Quarter, designed to blend in with one’s fashionable outfit. Its basic component resembles a waistcoat, but contains hidden steel plates between layers of leather, providing decent protection against knife attacks or brawling. Additional pieces include an armoured codpiece, a bracer for the gentleman’s shield arm, a reinforced steel collar (to defend against strangulation), and a small steel skullcap to protect the head from coshing, which fits neatly inside a hat.</p>

<p>The DC to identify a rake’s vest as armour is 17, with a +5 bonus if the garments are actually handled by the observer. </p>

<p>This armour is crafted by the mountain tribes of Bafatai, and its design predates the rise of the Knights of Harmony. It consists of a tabard, pouldrons, bracers, and a kilt made from tightly woven rope cords. In time of need it can be disassembled into 30ft of rope, and there are countless stories of Bafatan climbers saved by unpicking their armour and using it in this fashion, although this effectively destroys the suit. </p>

<p>Crafting the armour utilises the Use Rope skill, DC and requires special training from a Bafatan craftsman. Picking it apart to create a rope takes 1 hour and requires a Rope Use check, DC 15. </p>

Although unsuitable for arid climates and extreme heat, the armour generally suffers no ill effects for being used out of water in more temperate areas if appropriately maintained. Designed and used by underwater races, Shell armour is a little more streamlined than other suits. Reduce the Armour Check Penalty by 2 point with regards to swimming checks. </p>

<p>Weapon Type: Simple (hand held); Martial (attached) <br />

<p>A bayonet is a simple knife-blade, often quite long, that is designed to be a removable addition to an existing weapon, usually a musket, crossbow, or in rare cases, a quarterstaff. </p>

<p>If carried in the hand, a bayonet counts as dagger in all respects. When mounted on a suitable weapon however (attaching the bayonet is a Move action), treat that weapon as a shortspear, with a -1 penalty to hit representing the less than optimised makeup. Although the mount for the weapon requires slight reworking to accept a bayonet, the work requires only marginal competence and only the most basic of tools (the bayonet itself will do). </p>

<p>Bayonets are specifically designed not to impede the firing of crossbows or muskets. </p>

<p>Hollow wooden tube three feet long, often decoratively carved on the outside. It fires long needle-like darts, to which poison is often applied. A traditional lizardman weapon, used in hunting. The statistics are based on the Blowgun from the DMG, p145. </p>

<p>The bracer blade is a small knife, attached to a spring-mechanism on a metal bracer worn around the wrist. A secret catch allows the weapon to be activated, causing it to spring out into a ready position. In this state it counts as a lock gauntlet, but the mechanism is much more fragile and grants only a +4 to avoid being disarmed. The Search DC to spot at bracerblade is 18. </p>

<p>Because of tighter laws and the watchful eye of the civil patrol, many criminals have taken to carrying apparently innocent tools as concealed weapons. The simplest and easiest to obtain is often the folding razor, used by barbers across Ortho. </p>

<p>A folding razor is a light weapon, and can be used with the Weapon Finesse feat.</p>

<p>A swordcane resembles a normal walking stick or stave until its deadly secret is revealed: A slim steel blade similar to that of a rapier. Noticing the concealed weapon requires a Search check DC 20, with a +5 bonus if the viewer actually handles the weapon. </p>

<p>You can use the Weapon Finesse feat to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to attack rolls with a swordcane sized for you, even though it isn’t a light weapon for you. You can’t wield it in two hands in order to apply 1-1/2 times your Strength bonus to damage. </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div><span style="font-weight:bold">Sidebar: Variant Sword canes </span>
Some sword canes are designed to house an illegal hilt-pistol rather than a blade – the small and unique design means that it must be a masterwork pistol in this case. A few versions even come with a concealed wand (in this case add the wand’s cost to the above). Both these variants are class E items, forbidden for all citizens.</div></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-weight:bold">Outfits &amp; General Goods </span></span></p>

<p>Unlike other worlds, many of Orthorian goods are mass-produced in urban factories (and workhouses), keeping their cost down. Subtract cost of all outfits?</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dye Works</span></p>

<p>The image of red armoured soldiery marching in uniform rank on rank is so ingrained in the popular psyche (of both its allies and enemies), that any change in the Harmonium’s colour or design are unthinkable. Pity then the poor dyer, who labourers each day in awful stink to produce the cloth-dye and armour-paint required by millions of officers across both Prime and Planes. </p>

<p>The first dyes were also made from the powdered crimson carapace of beholders who opposed diplomacy with the other races, and who were murdered en-masse by their fellows at the ‘debate’. Such a murderous formula is no longer required, however. In fact, the exact colour and hue has been specified by law since the time of Juhlien, and each batch must be approved by a Harmonium alchemist or master dyer. Blood Clay mining is a major industry in the Flamedance Mountains, and everywhere else the clay or other suitable dye is found. Similar materials are a major import from Ortho’s colonies, and seeking our new sources is a duties of all expeditionary forces. </p>

<p>Dying is an unpleasant and thankless task. One of the primary ingredients is brewed from the rotting intestines of sheep, and the resulting vats of dye have a powerfully noxious smell, not helped by their usual proximity to the area’s abattoirs. The dye can also taint local watercourses, and stain or kill plant-life exposed to it. The dye stains human flesh too, and all dyers are eventually marked with reddened skin and the accompanying terrible stench. A coughing sickness known colloquially as Dyer’s Cough is also a common affliction among dyers, but whether this is a product of their work or just their impoverished circumstances is not yet known. </p>

<p>Edicts during the expansion of the Second Harmony forbade the building of dye works within town and city limits, and people in the profession were routinely stigmatised and excluded from larger society for generations. This custom was overturned by edict of the Composer a hundred years ago: </p>

<p>“The Dyers of Ortho and her colonies suffer and sacrifice as much for our great Harmony as any active soldier of the harmonium, and bare bloody wounds just as obvious as those who return from our campaigns. Although the placement of their workplace must be restricted for the general good and safety of the populace, it would be inharmonious, cruel, and unjust to measure these loyal citizens as one whit below our soldiers.” </p>

<p>Although many dyers remain as unwelcome as ever when they journey to town, their work is now at least officially recognised and more than few wear their red blotches with pride. </p>

<p>A tough simple outfit in red. The tunic’s front is marked with the Harmonium symbol. Crafted from cheap but rugged cloth, it’s worn by soldiers throughout Ortho and her colonies, and is instantly recognisable. Ragged and patched suits are sometimes given out as part of the provender as well, especially during disaster-relief efforts.</p>

<p>Included in the outfit is a wide ‘soldier’s belt’ of red leather (whose studs and badges are used to indicate rank and service) and a heavy winter cloak - hooded, insulated, and impregnated with natural oils to make it waterproof. The final component in the outfit is a sturdy pair of ‘stompers’ - hobnailed boots, exceptionally tough and durable (and which make a satisfying thump when they hit the ground). Stompers are even useable as a weapon for kicks (damage 1d4, crit 20/x2, but armed opponents receive an attack or opportunity). </p>

<p>Powerful though they may be, as part of the Harmonium, Beholders must obey the laws like everyone else. The restrictions on magic-use apply to the natural abilities of Beholders as well as spells. Beholders without the appropriate permit or authorisation for their eye-rays must wear ‘Caps’ over their ‘dangerous’ eyestalks at all times when in public. These are made of thin hammered brass, padded for comfort and set with an internal lock. The Cap effectively blinds the eyestalk. Eye Caps must be worn and locked in all public places (unless the beholder has appropriate permission to do otherwise), but each Beholder is also given the keys to unlock them in private.</p>

<p>The Eye Tyrants are notoriously obstructive and unhelpful in the matter of eye caps, and very lax in enforcing the regulations among themselves.</p>

Cost: 10gp<br />
Wgt: 2lbs</span></p>

<p>The politics of Motmurk have given rise to the belief that within even the lowliest pig-herder is the potential of a great hero and general. Such quality is best demonstrated with the orcish version of chess, called <span style="font-style:italic">kersh</span>. This is a game in which opponents play to dominate territory on a square board with markers of differing values. The fact that a marker may have a different face value on its reverse side makes this game as much one of memory as of strategy. Its a complex and nuanced game, easy to learn but hard to master.</p>

<p>Many sets are heirlooms passed down through the generations, made to commemorate famous battles and personages. The statistics above are for a good quality travelling set, but nothing intricate, prestigious, or magical.</p>

Magnifying Ocular (masterwork magnifying glass) - 100gp <br />
Spyglass, Orthorian (as spyglass, see PHB) - 400gp <br />
Double Spyglass (masterwork spyglass - binoculars) - 900gp</span></p>

<p>Personal eye lenses are set in a thick wooden, horn, or metal frame. They are known as “oculars” or “eye glasses”. These were actually derived from the Planar Harmonium’s contact with the modron race, who have long used enchanted oculars. The successful study and replication of modron lens-grinding techniques were an important early success in the Planar Harmonium, and an important first cooperation with the Fraternity of Order outside of Sigil. The populace and even many lower-ranked Harmonium (on either side of the Pool of Planes) are unaware of how important this success was in cementing support for the Planar colony. </p>

<p>Oculars come in several varieties. The simplest is designed merely to counteract vision defects in citizens, simply called ‘lenses’. More advanced versions are used by craftsmen for working with tiny materials and by Harmonium investigators to examine crime scenes. Advances in ocular design have also improved the magnifying glass and spyglass, as well as significantly reducing the cost. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Peacebond</span></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Availability: A <br />
Cost:  <br />
Wgt: ½ lb</span></p>

<p>Peacebonds have been in existence since long before the coming of Romhel and the Knights of Harmony. They consist of a cord or ribbon tying a weapon into its scabbard, from the simple (a bit of frayed rope) to the ornate and elaborate (such as the patterned silk coloured and knotted to indicate status, which is the norm in Osmopondia). The price listed above is for an expensive version, suitable for a noble’s outfit. They are seen most commonly on the frontiers of the Pax Harmonium, where weapon and armour restrictions are usually much lighter. In more civilised areas, citizens shouldn’t be carrying weapons without a good reason anyway, and having a peacebond doesn’t make much difference in those cases, but it does at least show willing.</p>

<p>Peacebonds are still used in many parts of the world, where necessity requires citizens and soldiers to go about armed. The zealousness with which it is enforced however, varies greatly. In some places, a peacebond is enough for the authorities to assume the bearer has a permit for their weapon; in others, carrying even a peace-bound weapon will get you constant hassle from the Civil Patrol.</p>

<p>A Peace Bonds require a Move Action to untie, and this usually takes 1d2 rounds – longer if the knot is particularly large or tight (or damp, in the case of rope). </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Pressprint Machine </span></p>

<p>This has got to be the primary tool for Harmonium propaganda. Everything is distributed quickly, mass produced, and in standardised format, and can be released simultaneously in all provinces on a certain date. The “block arrangements” (how each letter, space or design is arranged in the printing frame) can even be used as a simple code – one that only harmonium printers would know. </p>

<p>Only Harmonium-owned printing presses would be allowed of course – they are a weapon far too dangerous to be allowed in untrusted hands. Those who oppose the harmonium must do scribble out their pamphlets by hand, and for every one of theirs, the hardheads can run off a hundred in equal time. </p>

<p>Printing houses are a major part of every town, city, and army camp. They take commissions from non-Harmonium members, but these always require appropriate authorisation and papers - and the needs of Harmony always come first. Ordinary citizens usually have a wait of several weeks for their papers to be done. </p>

<p>The first print of any arrangement must also be scrutinised by a specialist OCA clerk to ensure no errors have been made. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Timepiece </span></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Availability: A <br />
Cost: 80gp <br />
Wgt: 8lbs</span></p>

<p>This heavy and complex item is composed of meticulously arranged cogs, springs, and counterweights – a masterpiece of advanced design. If the springs are wound daily, the clock keeps near perfect time for up to a year, after which it will need the attentions of a skilled chronometersmith to recalibrate it. More expensive versions also act as a simple calendar and almanac. Vigorous movement can potentially damage the timepiece. </p>

Cost: 15gp <br />
Wgt: 0.5</span></p>

<p>Eallian Cheese comes from its namesake, the troubled colony world of Eallia. It is a marbled cheese, with thick blue-green veins. It has a strong slightly greasy taste and a powerful odour that’s not always considered a pleasant one. Nevertheless, the cheese has numerous health benefits and many Orthorian doctors swear by it as a remedy for constitutional disorders. Sadly for its thousands of aficionados, unrest on the troubled colony world has caused supply to falter. Where once the colony produced Eallian as a major export, many ‘cheese towns’ are now empty and desolate.</p>

<p>Eallian Cheese contains an algae-based mould with powerful antiseptic properties. Eating a ‘dose’ of cheese grants someone who eats it +1 to Saves verses poisons and disease for the rest of the day.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Fjorge Honey</span></p>

<p>The colony-hives of the Fjorge produce massive quantities of honey for use as an alchemical agent. It is used extensively in the reproductive cycle of the Fjorge (and certain ceremonial events as well), but the colony world also exports (relatively small) amounts of it to the rest of the Pax Harmonium, where it is a valuable healing tool.</p>

<p>One dose of honey smeared on a wound acts as an antiseptic and also accelerates the recovery processes, granting a +2 bonus to Heal checks. Characters treated with a dose of honey each day also naturally recover faster: increase the character’s level by 1 for the purposes of natural healing.</p>

<p>In most places, the Daily Provender is a simple loaf of bread, perhaps containing a few nuts or dried fruits if fortunate. It is marked by the Harmonium seal, and many private groups also pay to add their own mark to it as well, when they want to curry favour with the poor. </p>

Cost: 300gp<br />
Wgt: 1lb</span></p>

<p>Black Ice is found only in the unmelting glaciers of the Ice Coast, in Bafatai. Thin veins of it can be mined from the glacier, for uses including alchemy and magic.</p>

<p>In normal climes a chunk of ice radiates glacial cold for almost a year before melting, making it useful for refrigeration and preserving goods. If tossed into a normal flame, the ice will snuff it out (usually surviving the process). The ice will also endure magical flames though it is incapable of snuffing them. This black ice is a valued export and is usually bought up swiftly by alchemists or the Ice Guard of Iathra.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Eating Black Ice</span></p>

<p>The black ice has another aspect though. If a tiny sliver is sucked on, it has a mild narcotic effect. A small cult has sprung up around this it known as The Dreamers of Shadow. Friends and family of dreamers regularly report large personality shifts, as the dreamer seems to become more driven and ruthless, uncaring of past relationships. The Harmonium is reluctant to regulate black ice as it remains very useful to many governmental projects and the impact of the ice on the population as a whole seems minimal. At the present time it is hovering on the edge of the Disapproval List</p>

<p>Craft DC: 25<br />
Effects +2 versus fear/-4 to Sense Motive</span></p>

<p>Nerve is a purely artificial substance, first brewed by Harmonium alchemists during the War of Iron.  It produces a feeling of confidence and a lack of concern for the wellbeing of the user and others. This grants +2 bonus to Saving Throws versus Fear effects, but users suffer a -4 to any Sense Motive checks. Effect lasts for 1d3+5 hours.</p>

<p>Nerve is very addictive, and regular users soon find themselves unable to cope with stress without it. Because of this it is no longer issued to Harmonium troops and is illegal on Ortho and her colonies. Unfortunately many addicted soldiery managed to smuggle a supply home during the War, and the formula was cracked by underworld alchemists. These days it is most often used by violent criminals.</p>

<p>Pressman’s Ale is a poison used in the past by unscrupulous recruiters to ‘pressgang’ citizens for service. It is a strong narcotic processed from a certain strain of Drowsepoppy flower. These days it’s cultivated in secret gardens and used mainly by rogues, although the Harmonium (specifically Exigency Teams and the Civil Patrol) sometimes use it to subdue dangerous criminals.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Vezzum </span></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Availability: C <br />
Cost: 8cp <br />
Wgt: n/a </span></p>

<p>Vezzum is potent liquor, which smells like strong rum but is clear in colour. It is often added to other drinks to increase their potency, or served in small cups alongside another drink. A few hardcore vezuum-addicts also snort the substance, even going so far as to purchase elaborately carved tiny spoons for the purpose. Snorting Vezzum is widely reputed (accurately as it turns out) to rot the brain, and is generally not permitted outside the Licensed Quarter. </p>

<p>Vezzum is a traditional Thaeran liquor, brewed in copper stills across the former empire and used by its oppressed and unhappy populace to escape the miseries of life. The substance is on the OCA’s ‘disapproval list’ – it’s not actually illegal but production and movement is regulated by punitive tariffs and sale is illegal outside the Licensed Quarter. Despite these restrictions, amateur vezzum production is popular throughout the Thaeran Provinces and even further afield. Discretely concealed vats can be found bubbling away in the jungle near many towns and villages. Scalefolk like kobolds and lacerde seem particularly fond of the stuff. </p>

<p>Pakari is a stimulant nectar found in the bulb of certain plants in Hazhkan and the Thaeran Provinces. As well as a mundane ingredient in potions of Bear’s Endurance and the like, the nectar can be taken raw for a sudden burst of energy, granting the bonus listed above. This boost lasts for about an hour, after which the user takes 1d2 Subdual Damage. Additional does taken can stave off the end of the high (and its negative effects), but the subdual damage taken is cumulative with every dose taken. Pakari addicts regularly ‘crash’ when their supply runs out and fall into a deep state of unconsciousness.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold"><span style="font-size:18px">Books &amp; Paperwork</span></span></p>

<p>Orthorian books are printed rather than scribed, mass produced, and above all cheap. Unlike other worlds, the population of Ortho is almost entirely literate – although their actual level of proficiency varies greatly. They are not necessarily widely read however; most Orthorians will have read much the same books as fellow citizens from across the Provinces and colonies.</p>

The Bard’s Almanac </span></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Availability: Class A <br />
Cost: 100gp <br />
Wgt: 5 </span></p>

<p>Each year every bureau of the OCA produces a book of significant events in its department. Each is named after the specific bureau and year (The Bard’s Almanac of Civic Harmony, 471PH for example) and serves as a “who’s who and what happened” for that year within that part of the OCA. The book is an invaluable reference tool, and grants a +2 bonus to Bardic Lore or Knowledge checks made about the correct subject for the correct year. </p>

<p>These books were originally published only as reference materials for the Octave and the Council of Ortho, but proved so popular that production was expanded about 70 years ago. Many citizens collect year after year of almanacs and major collections are a prestigious thing. Books from more than 70 years ago (when they were made public) are exceptionally rare and frequently sell for much greater sums than that listed above. There are literally only a handful books detailing the years before the Schism, and these are considered priceless. </p>

<p>This giant-sized slim book contains a simplistic – but still accurate – portrayal of Harmonium beliefs. It concentrates on Do and Do Nots, has many illustrations, and is clearly aimed at children or less mentally adept races. Its rules and explanations seem superficially juvenile, but they are at least clear and unambiguous; Orthorian scholars have been perfecting them for almost five hundred years now, after all. For most citizens, this is one of the first books they learn to read. For some, it’s the only one.</p>

<p>The book has a picture of a saluting ogre in spiked Harmonium plate armour on its front cover, and is sometimes cruelly referred to as the ‘Ogre Edition.’ </p>

<p>This is the legionary’s campaign edition, ironbound and designed to survive the worst that life in the Harmonium can throw at it. Fire, flood, swordblows, demons claws… these books have survived them all. It can even be used as a weapon in time of need (Simple Weapon, 1d4 damage, x2 on a critical). Crafted by masters of the art with five hundred years of experience, these tomes can survive everything from a trip to the depths of the ocean to a visit to the Elemental Plane of Fire.

<p>There are twenty five volumes in this mammoth set, one book for each Province and colony of the Pax Harmonium (including the Outer Planes). The books are basic gazetteers of each distinct area of Ortho and beyond, including recommendations on dealing with the natives, local customs, food and drink, etc. </p>

<p>These guides is somewhat broad and occasionally inaccurate or out or date, but referencing the relevant Gallivant’s Compendium gives a character +2 to basic Knowledge checks and Bardic Lore in the area detailed.

Wgt: 5 </span></p>

<p>The original Legacy Tome was penned by Romhel himself, shortly before his death. He passed the book to his successor to help guide them and the empire he created. It was actually a diary back then, upon which his more famous public memoirs The Journey is partly based. His successor also wrote in the remaining pages of the book and passed it on to his heir, who began a new tome in the same spirit, and the tradition continues right up to the present day. Legacy Tomes are the records, hopes, regrets, and advice of each Harmonium leader to his successor. </p>

<p>They are also supposed to remain a secret. As well as personal opinions and moral stances of the Composers and advice to their successors (including in some cases, a list of people to be killed), the tomes contain state secrets of the highest order - experiences in diplomatic wranglings, wars, even murders committed for the good of Harmony. It deals with the massacres of the fey and elves, the ignorance and pride that lead to the War of Iron, and other subjects that would shock the average citizen and provide a great deal of weight to the propaganda of its enemies. </p>

<p>The whole collection remains the personal property of the Conductor of Prime Harmony, and officially only the Octave are privy to their existence (although rumours have leaked, they are never confirmed). A few have gone missing over the years however, and the Harmonium is determined to get them back. Even rumours of a page or two can be enough to have an Exigency Team dispatched to ensure that they don’t fall into the wrong hands. </p>

All trench spades are made to exactly the same specification, to allow them to be used as measuring tools. The handle even comes with standard notches marking different distances. Military slang calls it a “dwarfy.”</p>

<p>One edge of the spade is sharpened, allowing it to be used as a weapon at need (especially if troops are attacked while digging entrenchments). All Harmonium soldiery receive basic training in fighting with a Trench Spade, and treat it as a Martial Weapon. The spade is even balanced for throwing. There are countless stories of troopers’ lives being saved by their trench spade. Some soldiers even carry it at their belt as a secondary weapon. </p>

<p>‘Mechanical Bard’ is the catch-all term for various clockwork devices that can be attached to a musical instrument, to play it in place of a living performer. Each bard is designed to be attached to a specific type of instrument and this can’t be changed once the machine is created (although it can be dismantled and moved from one appropriate instrument to another). The device is powered by an array of tightly-coiled springs and needs to be cranked before each piece is played. Each device can also play only a single piece of music, unless it is recalibrated by an expert (see below). </p>

<p>The Mechanical Bard Requires a Craft (Automaton) check, DC 20 and a Peform check of the appropriate skill with a -2 penalty, to programme with a specific song. The device will replay exactly the same performance each time it is activated. For every point of DC below 20 on the Craft check, lower the Perform result by one. </p>

<p>The magic lantern uses a light source, a lens, and pictures painted on glass plates to project a static image on a wall or suitable screen. The result is an unmoving two-dimensional phantasm, as realistic as the images’ creator can produce. Although some slides contain traditional painted images, in modern times magic is often used to produce more realistic results. Some traditionalist users refuse to carry these new-fangled magical plates, but their popularity is rapidly outstripping that of the old style. Only the relative expense of Phantasmal Glass has so far prevented it from completely replacing the more traditional style. </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div><span style="font-weight:bold">Sidebar: Phantasmal Glass </span>
Illusionists may seal their creations into a glass slide, allowing a realistic (although clearly not real) image to be projected onto a wall or screen. The creator must have access to an appropriate illusion spell (usually Silent Image), and have the Craft: Wondrous Item feat. The process takes 1 day and 6XP </p>

<p>Creating the glass slide requires Craft (Glassblowing) DC 20 and costs 100gp. The result has Hardness1 and 1hp.</div></p>

<p>There is a thriving trade in itinerant magic lantern shows across the inns of the empire, and many Freefolk make a living as ‘Phantasmagologists’ performing for the public. Accompanied by large numbers of slides, they create illustrated stories or show educational images of life across the Pax Harmonium. These performances are often accompanied by ‘special effects’ produced by means of extra sections that are slid or rotated across the main plate. One of the most famous of these - very popular with children - is the tale of Jhary’s Demon Bag, where an endless processing of demons, monsters, and cruel parents are stuffed into the wizard’s magical sack. </p>

<p>Magic lanterns are also sometimes used for educational purposes, record keeping, and for military reconnaissance by the OCA.</p>

<p>A zoetrope is an entertainment device, which produces an illusion of moving images by showing a rapid succession of static pictures. Many ‘Phantasmagologists’ (as magic lantern performers are known), also take a Zoetrope on the road with them. </p>

<p>This device a cylinder with slits cut vertically in the sides. Beneath the slits, on the inner surface of the cylinder, is a parchment band of sequenced drawings (which can be easily changed by the operator). As the cylinder spins, the user looks through the slits at the pictures on the opposite side of the cylinder's interior. The scanning of the slits keeps the pictures from simply blurring together, so that the user sees a rapid succession of images producing the illusion of motion, the equivalent of a ‘motion picture’ – such as horse galloping, soldier’s marching, or athlete jumping. The advent of Phantasmal Glass has reduced the popularity of Zoetropes; at present however there is no magical upgrade available for this device </p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Availability: Class A <br />
Cost: 35,000gp <br />
Wgt: n/a </span></p>

<p>The Orthorian steam horse is a portable steam-driven engine used to move heavy loads or work machinery. Although in limited use for over a hundred years, the steam horse has now been perfected for use by the civilian populace and is slowly spreading across Ortho. Most are supplied by the OCA for use in cities or on Provender Farms, but the kobold-run Kugnut Cartel of Xaric also produce a commercial version. Their steamhorses are available for hire or purchase, although they’re somewhat less reliable than the state machines. </p>

<p>Steamhorses are large and powerful but also extremely heavy and react badly to being. Nevertheless they have revolutionised many labours with their mechanical might – from turning mill wheels to running textile machines, to pulling ploughs. The frame-like hull surrounds a furnace, boiler, and spider-like array of wheels and pistons. It’s most notable feature however is a giant wheel called a rotor-arc that serves as the ‘arm muscles’ of the device for pulling and lifting. The average steamhorse functions with an effective Strength of 28 (counting as a large quadruped, meaning it can lift 7,200lbs and drag 36,000lbs). </p>

<p>Craft (Automaton) is the appropriate skill to build/operate these machines. The DC to build one is 30. </p>

<p>Most steam horses are technically portable, fitted with large wheels and a simple steering mechanism so it can be hitched to a team of draft animals. They are extremely heavy however and notorious for getting bogged down in the soft earth or mud, and its delicate mechanics don’t take too well to being moved; as a consequence, moving a steamhorse is usually a major operation that is done only under supervision of a skilled engineer. Most users just set them up near to where they are needed, powering other devices by means of continuous leather belt that runs from the rotor-arc to the chosen device, or dragging a cable with a tool on it up and down the field between two steam units. </p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic"><span style="font-weight:bold">About Aerostats</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Zeppelin Ticket: 1gp per mile <br />
Ferdie Hire (inc. Pilot): 10gp/hour</span></p>

<p>The Iirondan aerostat is a flying machine based around the principles of solarium gas. Boiling solarium extract in an alchemical liquid causes it to release of a gas that is lighter than air, though alas it’s also foully pungent and dangerously flammable. Pumped into air-tight sacks, the gas can send even the weight of a small ship rising up off the ground. The term for this aerial buoyancy is “aerostatic” and so these wondrous vessels are officially known as Aerostats. Once aloft, the vessel can be steered and propelled by sails similar to those of nautical craft, by steam-driven propellers, or by magic. </p>

<p>Aerostats are very expensive to build and maintain, and are still a relatively rare sight beyond Ortho’s great cities and provincial capitols. Iironda is the exception to this rule; here mooring towers and giant hangers dot the landscape, paid for by the mighty merchant houses of Han the Gem-Studded. Financed by the deep pockets of Hanish Houses, aerostats are also spreading steadily through Osmopondia and Xaric to connect the east in a network of aerial trade routes.</p>

<p>The Osmondians have used balloons and kites for military purposes for centuries, but Ferdios of Xaric was the first to construct a flying vessel from those principles. A keen ornithologist and somewhat eccentric land-owner from a remote part of the Province, he had long envied the soaring hawks he viewed by telescope. Unable to tempt a wizard into his service or secure a source of magical flight, he tinkered for years at creating a purely mechanical flying machine. He eventually secured the services of a clan of kobolds to aid in his experiments – or more precisely, to be his test subjects. Some historians have condemned this action of using helpless peons as experimental subjects, but rightly or wrongly Ferdios’ invention changed travel on Ortho forever. </p>

<p>Ferdios’ first invention surrounded the captain’s position entirely with gas sacks, leaving only a narrow window through which they could see. Later improvements allowed for steerage to take place on a ‘centre castle’ built on the top of the balloon. Larger aerostats now use an underslung structure designed along the lines of a ship’s hull (still called a gondola after the first boat Ferdios used for this design), but the top-mounted design still predominates on smaller craft, which are known as ‘ferdies’ in honour of their creator. </p>

<p>Ferdios’ machine gained him notoriety across Xaric and he was soon after approached by agents of the merchant houses of Han the Gem-Studded, bidding for the secret of non-magical flight. Ferdios sold out and his simple rural workshop became a full production line and research station. Five years later (after a number of outright failures and explosive accidents) the first commercial aerostat, the mighty Giant of Han went into service. </p>

<p>The Iirondian cartels have secured a monopoly on aerostat production, citing the numerous dangers and security issues that accompany solarium gas. Although they produce devices for use across Ortho and beyond, the centre of production remains Iironda and Xaric. </p>

<p>The typical commercial aerostat consists of a ‘gondola’ (virtually identical to a ship’s hull, except that it has a flat bottom and extendible ‘legs’ for landing); this is suspended beneath a series of individual gas-sacks lashed together to form a rough sausage-like shape, and covered by a protective tarpaulin. Legend says that Ferdios’ design was inspired by a visit to a provender factory where he witnessed sausage meat being pushed into pre-prepared skins. </p>

<p>The average commercial aerostat can lift 50 tones of cargo, controlling its flight by means of rigging and sails (similar to those found on ships but extending horizontally from either side of the craft). A few of the newer vessels, the ‘Founder Class’ - named after the original Knights of Harmony – have experimented successfully with steamhorse driven propellers and a second generation of steam-powered airships are now in production, named after famous Composers. </p>

<p>Ferdies follow the same basic design of gas sacks and horizontal rigging but the crew positions are often stationed not below, but in a cramped compartment on the top of the device (commonly known as the centrecastle). A very light internal frame allows the ferdie to sit (a little unsteadily) on the ground, and leaves space of a few items of equipment as well, including a cramped cabin. The Ferdie sees most use by the Harmonium as a scouting and exploration tool, but in recent years a few independent hire services have started up (which is swiftly becoming a smuggling nightmare in places). Some more eccentric noblemen also enjoy flying them as a hobby.</p>

<p>The Osmondian scout balloon is a dangerous-looking device that’s half balloon and half kite. The user ‘rides’ it by means of a backpack-like frame. This in turn is tethered to a long anchor rope, which connects to a caparison-like wheel and anchor on the ground. The anchor-wheel is used to extend and retract the guide rope, controlling the balloon’s height. </p>

<p>The brave scout straps himself into the harness while the balloon is filled with Solarium (originally hot air alone was used, but this proved unreliable). The balloon is then allowed to float upwards to the desired height using the tether rope and caparison. The occupant can steer the balloon somewhat by using the kite-like vanes to turn it into the prevailing wind, and can also pass messages up and down the rope using a pulley and twine system connected to the guide rope. </p>

<p>Scout Balloons are used mainly by lookouts to spy on enemy forces, and were most commonly seen during sieges, employed by both sides. Vulnerable to magical attacks, flying creatures, and (at lower altitudes) missile fire, balloon scout was (and remains) a perilous profession; many scouts carry a boot-mounted saw blade to cut the anchor rope in emergencies, even though this leaves them at the mercy of the winds. </p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic"><span style="font-weight:bold">About Ironclads... </span></span></p>

<p>The ironclad is a new breed of ship that is slowly replacing wood and sail vessels in the Harmonium navies. Originally the term just described military vessels, but has also become a general term for all advanced watercraft (even civilian ones) that are powered by steamhorse. </p>

<p>Military ironclads are literally ‘armoured ships’ – overlapping steel plates bolted to the hull of a regular Ship of the Line. Most ironclads still use sails, but also house a powerful steamhorse to drive a screw-like mechanical propulsion system when the wind is not in their favour. It’s expected that within a hundred years, many new ironclads will dispense with wooden hulls and perhaps even sails altogether.</p>

<p>Steamhorse-driven ships can reach their 2/3 of their normal speed using steamhorse alone (against the wind and eliminating the need for tracking), or when using both sail and steam it moves at 130% of their speed under sail alone.</p>

<p>Ironclads use most of the normal rules for ships, with a few exceptions. The iron cladding functions as ‘barding for ships’ except that it cannot be removed without significant work and also provides a bonus to hardness to and hp. The ship effectively counts as ‘wearing’ plate mail.</p>

Too expensive for most civilians, boilerboats are mainly used as tugs, messenger ships, and other transportation. The Harmonium uses them for coastal patrols and smuggler-hunting. </p>

<p>A few private boats can also be found in the hands of the wealthy, but relatively few nobles prefer the grime of soot and steam to the sleek lines of sail. </p>

<p>Paddlesteamers are giant riverboats propelled by steamhorse-driven paddles, which are mounted either at the vessel’s stern or in a hollow section at its centre. All but the largest models are confined to lakes and rivers. Paddlesteamers are the most impressive civilian ironclad available, but opinion on them is divided. Some people see them as a wonder of modern technology; others revile them as slow, smoke-belching monstrosities. This latter view is much more common in the traditional West, and so most Paddlesteamers are found in the heavily industrialised east, where they have a (sometimes undeserved) reputation as illicit houses of ill-repute - floating taverns, gaming halls, and brothels.</p>

<p>A typical paddlesteamer ticket costs 2sp per mile. </p>

         <p>I think the consensus is a late 17th - earlier 18th century, minus whatever is needed to keep the setting balanced. </p>

<p>Magic remains a practise of the individual, too draining (i.e. too few spells) to be put on the production line. Magic combined with technology is probably the most appropriate theme - think <span style="font-style:italic">Apparatus of Kwalish</span> - or "apparatus of the crab" as its now known. Poor old Kwalish lost the patent to the Harmonium it seems...  <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/cool.png" title="Cool" alt="Cool" class="smiley-content"/> </p>

<p>There's been some talk about "magic failing" on Ortho since the - ahem - 'disapearance' of the Fey, but whatever effect we decide on it probably isn't widespread or significant - at least yet.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Aye, the weakening of magic (and the environment, etc) is something to play up in plots - it's a developing thread.</p>

<p>I really really like the oculars and the eye caps in this writeup <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/smile.png" title="Smiling" alt="Smiling" class="smiley-content"/> </p>

<p>The oculars because it is a subtle and hands down *good* sort of item, and really reflects the benefits of living under the Pax Harmonium. This writeup just adds depth to the world.</p>

<p>Do we have any rules on how fast the caps can be taken off in case of emergency - medical or otherwise? There may also be some provincial rules in the beholders home province that loosens the cap restrictions but in those areas i could see younglings being required to wear them anyway. Imagine the havok a five yr old with distegrate could cause.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p><span style="font-weight:bold"><span style="font-size:18px">Special &amp; Magic Items</span></span></p>

<p>In addition to magic and alchemical items, this section also contains several examples of cutting edge Orthorian technology such as the Silvershield, Combat Zoetrope, and Dragonroar. These items are all rare, expensive, and strictly limited to specialist Harmonium personnel. They utilise advanced knowledge of physical laws and magical energies, but are somehow neither magical nor psionic in nature. In truth, each works only by an advanced understanding of natural laws, beyond even the understanding of most engineers and artificers. Rumour has it that such devices are created by a single individual, which urban legend names only as Deathsage or the Demon Engineer or the Lord of War. Who this genius is - or indeed if he or she is just a single person - must surely be one of the most closely guarded secrets of the Harmonium…</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic"><span style="font-weight:bold">Alaetine Staff </span></span><br />
These white wood quarterstaffs are carried by itinerant priestesses of Alae to defend their honour and their lives in time of need. Topped with the goddess’ symbol in steel, each stave is imbued with the Goddess’ merciful touch. Orthorian law does not consider them weapons. </p>

<p>It was Varzak of the Crushing Fist who gave such a mocking name to so terrible a weapon as this, when he experienced their effects first hand in the retaking of Iathra. The orcs give high praise to those able to laugh in the face of danger, and the phrase “Varzak’s laugh” has entered the Motmurk lexicon as a term of respect for one who shows know fear in the face of certain doom. </p>

<p>Although never exactly numerous, these weapons were seen all too often in the war against the Master of Brands. Thankfully most of them were taken and destroyed when Alzrius’ earthly minions were defeated. A handful of these relics still survive however, sought after with all-consuming lust by his remaining cultists; legend says that entire cabals exist simply to re-acquire these lost relics. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Powers: </span>The Alzrian Toothpick is a shaft of eternally red-hot iron, whose head burns constantly with vile abyssal flames (unlike a normal flaming weapon, it cannot be turned off). It functions as an Unholy Flaming, Flame Burst, Returning Shortspear +1.

<p>Arrows of the Viper are found primarily in the Thaeran Isles, although who exactly makes these deadly weapons is unknown. The tips are green-tinged iron, the shaft is painted with shamanistic designs, and the flights are brightly coloured feathers from Thaeran jungle birds: The materials may be primitive, but they are assembled with masterful skill and significant magical knowledge. They are of course, highly illegal. </p>

<p>Arrows of the Viper are favoured by assassins and rebels. They are traded on the black market in small numbers, and can be obtained from nefarious sources throughout the Thaeran Provinces (although easiest in the Isles). Exactly who makes these weapons remains unknown – it’s just one more of many mysteries among the Isles. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Powers</span>: Arrows of the Viper are +1 Arrows.

<p>This enchanted scabbard is used by freefolk and criminals, not all of them assassins – but its infamy is indelibly connected with the Thief Lords and their murderous wiles. The Harmonium also uses such devices occasionally - although not for assassination, it claims. Diplomats and Exigency Teams have used Assassin’s Sheaths to provide them with an unexpected advantage when a supposedly peaceful parley suddenly became a murderous melee. </p>

<p>An Assassin’s Sheath looks like a normal, if somewhat ornate, scabbard. Several styles exist, each suitable for a particular style of weapon (dagger, longsword, and bastard sword being the most common). The command word is sometimes worked into the scabbard on the side which rests against the wearer. When this is not the case, the pattern on the scabbard usually alludes to the word in some way. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Powers</span>: When the command word is spoken, the scabbard and any weapon in it shrink to miniscule size, effectively becoming part of the belt they are attached to; only a Search check at DC 30 can spot them in this state.

The scabbard can be shrunk or enlarged any number of times per day. <br />

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Automaton (Orthorian Construct)</span></p>

<p>Summoning and binding elemental spirits to empower golems and constructs is illegal in the Pax Harmonium. Dooming creatures (if creatures they are; the matter is still debatable) to slavery and madness was deemed unacceptable – as was the constant risk of a golem going rogue. Debate over the exact nature of the spirits used and the moral repercussions raged for years, but eventually the threat to safety was used by the OCA to justify forcing the issue and barring their use. In theory all such constructs were dismantled and their spirits freed in a “golem amnesty” when the law came into force, but even today its rumoured that many old and hidden constructs are powered by elemental slaves. There’s little to tell the two kinds of construct apart, especially if care is taken to disguise one. </p>

<p>Constructs can be found throughout Ortho, assisting labourers in its fields, factories, and occasional sieges. Known as ‘Automatons’ rather than golems, they are not empowered by elemental spirits, but Gear Spirits summoned from the Clockwork Nirvana. They are somewhat more numerous can regular golems, as the expense of creation is often taken on by the state or rich Cartels, but they’re still not exactly common - most automatons seen by the general public are merely rented rather than purchased, or assigned to a specific task by an OCA supply yard.</p>

<p>Although superficially similar, Automatons are usually constructed of more intricate and complex form than golems. Whether cast of clay, metal, or stone, an automaton is engineered to a more complex level than most golems, up to and including duplication of the joints and muscles of a human body. The more complex the automaton’s engineering is, the easier it is for the Gear Spirit (or Spirits) to occupy the body and the more powerful the resulting construct. Such construction is much more comfortable to the Gear Spirit than a golem’s body is to an elemental spirit, and automatons lack the potential to go berserk that taints other golems. </p>

<p>Treat Automatons as regular constructs, except as noted below: </p>

<p>No civilian-owned automaton may deliberately injure a living being. This is bound into the enchantments of every legal automaton and are integral to its construction. Automatons can be created without this safeguard, but they are restricted to the military (Class D). Illegally created “attack automata” should be treated as normal golems.</p>

<p>Every automaton comes with a Master Key as part of the enchanting process. Each Automaton has a matching socket for this key prominent in the automaton’s chest casing (known as the Master Lock). When the key is inserted and turned, the automaton is ‘locked’ (becomes inanimate) until turned back on again. The key may be removed without re-activating the automaton. The automaton also obeys the commands of the key bearer over any other instructions (not including the ban on doing harm). </p>

<p>Inserting and activating the master key into a disobedient Automaton requires a touch attack against the construct with a -10 penalty, and a Dex check at DC 20. A failed Dex roll leaves the key inserted but not turned. Master Key sockets are also vulnerable to the Knock spell, but military automatons are usually protected by an Arcane Lock enchantment (which negates the Knock and also prevents the Master Lock from working for 10 minutes). </p>

<p>Automatons have no chance of going berserk in combat. They do however have a 1% chance every time they are given a command of misinterpreting it and acting somewhat outside the bounds of their instructions. If the automaton is not given explicit literal instructions (DM’s discretion) this chance is doubled (2%). If given a command that lasts more than a single day, the DM makes a roll for the automaton once per day. Suggested actions for a malfunctioning automaton are listed on the table below. Roll 1d12 for a random result:<br />
 <br />
1) The automaton endlessly repeats the action and never considers it to be “finished” – it refuses further orders. <br />
2) The automaton attempts to repeat the task every time circumstances will allow it and whenever it is not directly involved in following other instructions, but abandons the task while fulfilling new orders. <br />
3) The automaton moves on from the command to a related task or matter (or just one that happens to be occurring nearby), believing it to be part of the original task. <br />
4) The automaton immediately heads off in a random direction, endlessly heading in that direction and refusing to obey other orders (a particularly common malfunction when a task is described as “over there.”) <br />
5) The automaton’s “lock” ceases to function. There are no outward sign of malfunction. <br />
6) The construct no longer automatically obeys the bearer of its Master Key. There are no outward signs of malfunction. <br />
7) The automaton becomes obsessed with a certain element of the task, or some aspect of the scene in which the task takes place (a type of person, a colour, a certain action, etc), and acts as though that thing is essential to all tasks from this point onwards.  <br />
8 ) The automaton attempts to ‘mate’ with the nearest complex mechanical object, attempting to integrate itself into that object. <br />
9) The automaton develops a “quirk” based on the next strong personality trait it perceives, and intermittently imitates it from then on. <br />
10) The automaton loses control of one of its limbs, which locks in place or dangles uselessly until repaired. <br />
11) The automaton does exactly the opposite of whatever it is instructed to do. <br />
12) The automaton ceases to function entirely.</p>

<p>Most deviations from orders are minor and resolved when the task is done, or add an ignorable quirk to the perceived character of the automaton. If the problem becomes significant however, the Automaton’s owner has two options: </p>

<p>First and most simply, locking the Automaton with its key and leaving it for about a minute usually dismisses the problem. The chance of this is a percentage, equal to 5 x level of the construct’s creator. If this fails the Automaton requires more complex and time-consuming repairs. This requires a Craft: Automaton roll, DC 15 – 25 (DM’s discretion), 1d3 days, and material costs equal to 10% of the construct’s value. </p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Making Automatons: </span>This requires the skill Craft (Automaton) although the DC varies depending on the construct or item to be created (see individual descriptions of the construct). </p>

<p>The Floating Towers of Thaera come in various shapes and sizes, but are rarely of more than modest size. Most are between forty and sixty feet high, and from twenty to forty feet across. Each tower is built on a small, manmade island, which covers about half again the land area of the tower itself and extends about twenty feet into the water. This landmass counterbalances the tower's own weight and provides a bit of beachfront for small boats and the like to tie up to.<br />

<p>Despite the name an Iron Brain is a lifeless machine, not a Construct. It is a calculating device made of gunmetal and polished brass. It consists of a yard-long cubic frame, within which are set columns each displaying the numbers from 0 to 9 on separately rotating segments. The first column represents the numbers 0 to 9, the second column 10 – 19, the third 20 – 29 etc. The rest of the mechanism is made up of various cogs and leavers for operating the system, which performs mathematical calculations. There’s no theoretical limit to the number of columns a machine can be made with, but most Iron Brains can calculate only into the hundreds of thousands. Larger machines exist (notably those performing budgetary calculations for the Council of Ortho), and these can calculate into the millions however. Once the majority of Brains were produced on Ortho, but the insectile colonies of Fjorge have recently outstripped native production in both quantity and aesthetic design. </p>

Ortho’s largest Iron Brains is called ‘Acumenus’ – a giant machine that keeps track of the total number of Harmonium converts made across the Multiverse.

<p>The Iron Brain calculates strictly mechanically, with no chance of error. Operators however, have been known to make mistakes: An INT check at DC 5 is required to set the machine correctly; the Brain always gives a correct answer to the question it is given, but may actually be answering a question that was inputted wrongly. The base time to perform a calculation is one minute for simple mathematical problem measuring in the hundreds or thousands. <br />

<p>These wide belts are made by the Seaborn Exiles, from sealskin set with pearls, embossed with images of Mer and sea beasts, and embroidered with thread dyed by the inks of rare molluscs. The Exiles guard the secret of its construction, but sometimes give them out to heroes who earn their respect – woe to those who then break the ancient pact of friendship between the Seaborn and the Mer however: A blood feud is the only honourable response. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Powers</span>: A Girdle of the Sea-kin Oath gives the wearer the ability to speak and understand the Merfolk language, and also grants them Cold Resistance 5. The wearer can also draw upon Aid once per day. If the wearer harms a Mer however, all these powers disappear until they receive an Atonement spell from a Mer cleric. </p>

<p>Harmonised Armour is made from fine steel that has been impregnated with the axiomatic energies of Arcadia. Blended by a secret magical method by Planar smiths, Harmonised Armour protects the wearer from even the most despicably chaotic foe. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Powers</span>: Harmonised Armour is a +1 value quality that can be applied only to metal armour. It grants an additional +1 AC versus chaotic attackers and a +4 bonus to Saving Throws from spells or effects with the Chaos descriptor. </p>

<p>The Helm of the Emberhawk is made of burnished steel, with a red plume of its namesake’s feathers and a beaklike visor that gives the wearer an avian appearance. It was contributed to the Harmonium armouries by an otherwise reclusive (human) wizard from northern Keln, by the name of Anok Sabé. She was one of the first humans to colonise Keln after the Beholder hegemony joined the Alliance of Harmony, and her tower still stands today, perched precariously on one of its towering peaks. Many historians believe that a regular supply of Helms of the Emberhawk was the price she negotiated to be left alone by the beholders. As a consequence these items are readily available in the bazaars of Keln, Bafatai, and Kharazam. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Powers</span>: The Helm provides no additional bonus to AC, but two useful benefits: Once per day the wearer can summon a Young Emberhawk (see the Ortho Bestiary for more details) to serve her as if by means of Summon Monster IV. Secondly, the avian magic of Anok Sabé grants the user a permanent Feather Fall effect, which automatically activates if the wearer falls more than 5ft. </p>

<p>No one knows exactly how these oddly-named items found their way in the arsenal of Ortho’s thieves and Freefolk. Hullwalker Boots enable even the most clumsy rogue (or thug) to evade pursuit or begin a thriving career in second-storey work. Due to the depredations of rogues armed with this item, the Harmonium have categorised it as a Class E item – possession is grounds for immediate arrest. </p>

<p>Many believe the name stems from some nautical (mis)adventure by an unknown freeblade. Sadly his or her name has not survived, but their boots have. Copies of the original are available from various disreputable sources among the Free. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Powers</span>: These calf-length magical boots look like they’d belong on a stereotypical sea captain’s feet. They stick to any surface to user wills them too, adhering so strongly that the wearer can walk up walls and even stand on a chamber’s ceiling. In fact they stick so hard that the wearer requires significant extra effort to take every step: half the wearer’s movement while the Boots are activated. </p>

<p>The Midewwin Bag is a sacred satchel carried by Hazhkan’s tribal hunters. Created by tribal shamans (these days often converts to the Lords of Order), the bag is attached to a bead-embroidered cloth that wraps around the waist. Into the bag go the bones of totem animals and other secret magical ingredients, and the bag itself is made from a specific animal’s skin (see below). The bag is sealed with a complicated sacred knots, and it’s forbidden for anyone but a Hazhkan shaman to open them. </p>

<p>Midewwin bags grant the wearer spiritual aid in hunting the type of creature that the bag is dedicated to (identified by the skin used to make the bag). In this enlightened age, bags created from intelligent races are of course forbidden by law. Unfortunately a few ‘Bad Midewwin Bags’ (created from the skin of intelligent races) are available on the black market, made by unscrupulous shamans and witchdoctors. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Powers</span>: A Midewwin Bag is worn as a belt. It grants the wearer use of the Favoured Enemy bonus (as a 1St level Ranger) against the specific race of creature that the bag is dedicated to. If this creature would normally be subject to a favoured enemy bonus from the wearer, then they calculate their bonus as if they were 5 levels higher. </p>

<p>These tiny stylised figurines of red-tinged clay are the latest resource to spring from the taming of Hazhkan. Produced by tribal ‘medicine men’ for their warriors, these one-shot minor magical items have proved incredibly popular in the rest of Ortho. As well as being a valuable resource for newly civilised tribes, their popularity has attracted many foreign wizards in search of their secrets. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Powers</span>: Each Clay Fetish can be used only once. On discharging its magic, the fetish crumbles to dust. Known fetish-powers include the following: </p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Fetish of the Boar: user +10 temporary hit points (lasts 1 round) </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Oath Seal of the Lords of Order </span></p>

<p>Among the scrupulous merchants of Ortho, it is tradition to seal important contracts with an oath upon a relic of the Lords of Order. These icons were created to assist that purpose. They are also used by diplomats and peace-makers to seal accords between nations, colonies, and provinces. </p>

<p>An Oath Seal is essentially an enormous holy symbol, dedicated to all the Lords of Order. It resembles a two-handed mace with a shaft of red steel and an eight-faced head, upon each side of which is the divine symbol of one of the Lords of Order. These symbols are worked in silver, but change colour when an oath is spoken by someone touching the Seal. If they speak the truth, the symbols turn golden; if the speaker lies, they turn inky black. Traditionally each side of the negotiations requests an Oath Seal from their favoured church, which is sworn on by the other party. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Powers</span>: The Discern Lies effect is useable only per day (the colour change lasts 24 hours). Although not specifically designed for it, Oath Seals can also be wielded in combat: Treat it as a Great Club+1 with the special property that it becomes a +3 weapon and does +2d6 damage against any target it has revealed as a liar within the last 24 hours. </p>

These weapons were crafted for use against the Shadow Lords of ancient Osmopondia, and their minions still fear their bright golden flames.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Powers</span>: The Osmopondian Fire Shield is a +1 Blinding Tower Shield of Light Fortification. On command of the wielder it also burns with bright celestial fire: This causes 2d6 divine fire damage (half normal fire and half holy celestial fire, as per a Flamestrike spell).

<p>Nahr-aglar means ‘shining glory’ in the cruel elfish tongue. It was created by Dowager Queen Nahnehth, last ruler of the Western Shaar in the latter days of the War of Unification. After suffering several major defeats in the war (including the loss of her champion and beloved son, Fuin Mor), Queen Nahnehth created Nahr-aglar to reverse the defeats of her people and lead the elves to glorious victory. The Knights of Harmony were a match for even its deadly magic, but the sword was never captured by the Knights or their followers - it was carried away from the battlefield by an unnamed elven deserter after the last Champion of the Shaars was killed. Unheard of for generations afterwards, it resurfaces from time to time to plague the heirs of Romhel; always somehow managing slip out of the Harmonium’s grasp, as if protected by fate or the Lords of Chaos. The OCA would give a great deal to see it finally destroyed, and this alone has given Nahr-aglar legendary status among the Harmonium’s enemies. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Powers</span>: Nahr-aglar is a +5 Baneful Anarchic Keen Mighty Cleaving, Adamantine Longsword in the distinctive elven style of the ancient Shaars. Its Bane quality is directed against humans.

<p>As part of his reformation, the god Didairdin taught his priests the ritual to make this sacred pouch, which the Lord of Order then filled with divine earth from his own celestial garden. Since that time Didairdin’s Blessing has been used by his clerics to clear land for farming and to cultivate new crops. Creating this item is one of the most longstanding miracles of the faith: After the Pouch is properly sewn and sanctified it is left in the chapel’s tabernacle overnight - miraculously filling with sacred soil by dawn. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Powers</span>: Each pouch of Didairdin’s Blessing contains five handfuls of his sacred soil. One handful of soil scattered onto the ground produces one of the following effects (or magic of a similar level, if the DM so desires): </p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Availability: n/a <br />
Cost: n/a</span></p>

<p>Impenetrable to arrow and pistol-shot, heavy enough to crush a village beneath its wheels, large enough and so surrounded by smog as to be mistaken for a small volcano. The Rolling Fortress is a smoke-belching, cannon-bearing terror that has thankfully seen few battles. </p>

<p>Each is a massive fortress of steel and stone, built like a ziggurat on immense granite rollers. Cannons bristle from every level, alongside terrible magical and alchemical weapons, a Silvershield, and a Big Preacher cannon. From within its belly, legions of harmonium troopers can be disgorged, or can hole-up safely for a prolonged siege. Beyond all these means of death however, it is the sheer size and monstrous majesty of the thing that cows many opponents. The mere sight of a Rolling Fortress is often enough to bring submission to a rebellious colony or hostile world. </p>

<p>Fist of the Hierarch was the first of the Rolling Fortress, supplied by the great Varzak of Motmurk for the Iathran campaign. It was a Baatezu creation made green-tinged steel and cruel magic, but whether they forged it for him or he somehow bought, bartered, or stole the machine is unknown. Its effectiveness was undoubted, but the Fist acquired a reputation for terror and destruction that has followed all the Rolling Fortresses from that day to this. </p>

<p>Rolling Fortresses are massively expensive undertakings, both to construct and maintain. As a result the whole Pax harmonium maintains only three such machines, although there is also a fourth standing inoperable. Despite the incredible expense, the Planar Harmonium is also said to have three these great ‘land leviathans’ - but there names, location, and orders are not common knowledge. Ortho’s Rolling Fortresses are: </p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">The Hierarch’s Fist </span>– located in south Thaera, where it serves as headquarters of the Harmonium Legions of that realm. It rolls forth occasionally to graphically illustrate some point of the ruling triad to its troublesome province. </p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">The Fury of Arcadia</span> – Dispatched to the far north of Ulfrheim on unspecified duties near the North Pole. Although no one has seen the fortress for almost a decade, the Harmonium continues to receive reports on its progress via magic. </p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">The Glorious Indomitable</span> –This fortress is currently serving on the colony world of Eallia, providing a mobile command post for the pacification forces.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">The Mount Triumphant </span>– This fortress was designed to resemble an Osmopondian ziggurat, and was instrumental in bringing those city states in line. Originally set to watch over the insular nomads of the region, it was destroyed by rebel forces during the Schism, although the shell remains mostly in tact. Today a thriving tent town has grown up around it, used for trade and parley by itinerant tribes.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Availability: D <br />

Wgt: n/a </span></p>

<p>The Silvershield is a defensive weapon employed at major Harmonium installations across Ortho and the colonies. The TFB is a mass of boilers, steam turbines, and arcs of lightning, from which an array of tall cannon-like barrels sprout upwards. The machine is huge and immobile, and requires a significant emplacement as well as producing constant rumble and vibrations sufficient to set a person’s teeth on edge. A heavy smell of burning also permeates the air, further disturbing those in proximity to the device. Rolling Fortresses are the only vehicle big enough to house one. </p>

<p>Little is known about the internal structure of the TFB because the engineering principles are state secrets of the highest order. Even the scientist-engineers who maintain the device live in virtual seclusion, all members of the Harmonium and guarded throughout their lives. What is known is that the TFB harnesses powerful natural forces to create something called ‘naturalistic psionics’, a force which accelerates vapourised adamantine to several hundred times the speed of normal artillery. The result is a fountain of fine silver mist, which can penetrate through even the thickest armour plating without slowing in the slightest. It is devastating to both creatures and objects, normally destroying them outright. Only powerful magic can protect against its effects. </p>

<p>The Silvershield is designed to defend primarily against spelljammers and flying attackers and is of very limited use against other targets. When activated it sends a brief umbrella of particles high into the air, which form an arc almost 200 miles in diameter. The silvershield’s super-accelerated particles crash through anything in their path, acting as a Disintegrate spell. Thankfully the particles never seem to fall to the ground. </p>

<p>The effect is neither magical nor psionic, and any such Resistances do not protect against it, although it is stopped by a Wall of Force or similar powerful magic. At maximum capacity, the generator can fire once every 2d3 minutes, with each ‘shot’ using 1,000gp worth of powdered adamantine for ammunition. </p>

<p>The OCA is exceptionally cautious about the security of each and every Silvershield, with a well-known “better safe than sorry” attitude to its defence. In the event of its capture, each device has explosives built into it, which can be set to destroy it utterly if necessary. So far, only a single Silvershield has ever been lost: A device was “lost in transit” after arriving in the planar city of Sigil, on its way to be installed in the City Barracks. The mysterious entity known only as The Lady is suspected to be responsible, but the Conductor of External Harmony has reported that confirming the artefact’s fate or reacquiring it is impossible at this time. </p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic"><span style="font-weight:bold">Shackles of the Archmage </span></span></p>

<p>These adamantine manacles aren’t designed for use by an arch-mage, but on one. They are used to capture powerful spellcasters and supernatural creatures, eliminating any powers beyond mere physical might. They first saw use during the pacification of the colony world of Meter, being used to capture the powerful Demarcator mages of that empire, but since then their use has spread significantly. Most major cities or Provinces have access to a set of shackles (but rarely more than one) in case of supernatural trouble. These items are particularly prized by troopers in the planar branch of the Harmonium – an export that nets considerable gold for the OCA’s coffers. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Powers</span>: The wearer is subject to the effects of an Anti-magic Field. The Escape Artist DC is 28. The break DC is 40 (thanks to their adamantine construction). </p>

<p>Speculums are scrying devices designed to allow 2-way communication between distant locations. These items are the exclusive province of dignitaries of the Council of Ortho, the Octave, and certain other major dignitaries – such as ambassadors and legates. Although harmless and used simply for communication by officials, rumours exist of ‘Master Mirrors’ which can eavesdrop on active mirrors without their knowledge. </p>

<p>Physically, a speculum resembles a full-length mirror of masterwork quality, framed by a red-gold boarder set with azurite, diopside, and apatite (all crystals that aid in divination magic). The glass is 3ft wide and 6ft high. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Powers</span>: By touching the glass and concentrating on activating its magic, a mystical connection is forged between a pair of attuned mirrors. Those stood before each speculum can communicate as easily as if the mirrored glass were an open doorway between two adjoining rooms. Communication is two way and not restricted to the activator/owner of the speculum; anyone in the vicinity can see and hear through the glass. Once activated, a speculum’s link can be maintained with minimal mental effort for as long as the initiator wishes. </p>

<p>Each Speculum is attuned to a one other of its kind, and only communicates with that Speculum. The attunement can be reset between two different mirrors, by a relatively simple ritual that involves casting Greater Scry while touching both mirrors. </p>

These days it is used mainly by cultist-assassins of Jislana, and a few rebel Thaeran monks and warriors trying to uphold the ancient ways. </p>

<p>The Wyverntail is a length of light chain, tipped with a triangular blade, somewhere between a dagger and a shortsword in length. It is easily recognisable because the steel shimmers with colour, as if made of solidified oil. Treat the Wyverntail as a Spiked Chain, but change the damage type from Piercing to Slashing. </p>

<span style="font-weight:bold">Solarium</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Availability: Class D (C in some cases)<br />
Cost: 1sp per charge<br />
Wgt: 1/20lb</span></p>

<p>Raw Solarium occurs on Ortho and some of its colonies alongside sulphur and coal. In its natural state it is a crumbly yellow stone that is unstable, inflammable, and toxic. Once considered simply a hazard, alchemists have learned to harness its explosive properties. Solarium contains what Orthorian alchemists have named ‘the essence of the sun’ and so is sometimes known as solidified fire or sunpowder.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div><span style="font-style:italic"><span style="font-weight:bold">Sidebar: Solarium Poisoning</span>
In its natural form, Solarium irritates naked skin causing painful rashes. If inhaled however, it is a potentially deadly poison. Fortitude Save DC 15 - damage: 1d2 Con/1d2 Con.</p>

<p>Repeated exposure to Solarium (over a number of years) leads to swollen flesh, rotted bones, and severe disfigurement, as well as a sickly luminous yellow colouring to the flesh. There are stories of long-term factory workers in the industrialised east whose diseased flesh literally glows in the dark. </span></div></p>

<p>When exposed to flame, solarium combusts in a bright flash of golden light. Alchemists have used it for years to create thunderstones, glow rods, and flashpowder. Mixed with other ingredients, solarium powder is now used in cannons, aquebus, and other powder-based weapons, and Solarium charges are used alongside Disintegration magic to dig tunnels and clear roads. It has some use in advanced engineering, but after a number of explosive accidents the substance has been banned from general use until further developments in alchemy render it safe for general civilian use.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most impressive use of Solarium is as a gas. Boiled in an alchemical solution, solarium gas is released, which is highly flammable and lighter than air. Pumped into an air-tight sack, solarium gas has sufficient lift to raise it off the ground but remains highly flammable. See ‘Aerostat’ for more details.</p>

<p>Around three hundred years ago, Harmonium experiemental philosphers began adding alchemical liquids to the solarium refinement process. This refined powder keeps better and is safer and more potent. Most solarium is transported in barrels of on-flammable oil, and required drying before it can be used. Copper boxes are used to carry readied sunpowder, as that material does not create sparks when struck. Possession of refined solarium is a Class C/D Offence – only the Harmonium and certain licensed individuals may craft, possess, or use it.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic"><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div><span style="font-weight:bold">Sidebar: Solarium Weapons</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Solarium is essentially Masterwork quality gunpowder. It burns more reliably and evenly than standard materials, and with noticeably more force. Weapons charged with Solarium rather than gunpowder or smokepowder have +1 to hit.</p>

<p>There is a small chance of powder detonating if exposed to fire. The powder is generally safe unless the amount of damage is large enough to burn through the container, but if the character ever fails a Saving Throw versus fire and rolls less than the spell’s level, any powder carried ignites.</p>

<p>A twentieth of a pound of solidified fire ignites at the touch of flame and flares brightly for 1 round: Treat this effect as a sunrod – it is enough to dazzle creatures who are vulnerable to bright sunlight, and if done in darkness it ruins Darkvision for 1 round after it dissipates.</span></div></p>

<p>Tiny paper packet, containing a bullet and a charge of solarium. It grants a bonus of +1 to hit when loaded into a firearm. If subject to a flame, it explodes as described above. </p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Availability: D<br />
Cost: 3sp per foot<br />
Wgt: 0.1lbs per foot of length.</span></p>

<p>Fuses are lengths of twine impregnated with solarium. They burn with a bright yellow spark and a noxious smell, consuming about 1 foot of fuse per round. Lighting a fuse requires a source of fire and is a move equivalent action. Depending on the method used, the action may or may not provoke an Attack of Opportunity.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Solarium Torch</span></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Availability: B<br />
Cost: 15gp<br />
Wgt: 1</span></p>

<p>A solarium torch looks similar to a glow rod, but larger. The head burns with a bright halo of golden sparks, and doesn’t smell very pleasant. Although alchemically produced, it counts as ‘magical fire’ with regards to being extinguished. It lasts three hours, and has a light radius of 50ft (shadowy after 30ft). </p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Exotic Weapon (cannon) – uses the chief artillerist’s INT modifier rather than Dex when rolling to hit. “Rate of fire” is 1 per hour, assuming a large trained crew is present.</span></p>

<p>The Big Preachers are the largest and most powerful cannons that the Harmonium can build. Cast in a special alloy called black bronze, each weapon is 50ft long and weighs 17 tons. The Preachers normally fire stone shot (a sphere weighing 700lb), but occasionally use projectiles of adamantine for destroying particularly tough (usually magical) targets.</p>

<p>Each Big Preacher is named after a famous patriarch of one of the Lords of Order, and whole Provinces sponsor their construction. Even the shot they fire is blessed by priests before going into service, and is named and numbered as well as inscribed with prayers.</p>

<p>The hilt-pistol is a concealed weapon available occasionally to undercover Harmonium personnel (mostly in iironda) but illegal for civilians. The device consists of a single-shot pistol incorporated into the hilt of a sword, the grip of a cane, or some other item. The Search DC to notice the Hilt-pistol is 18 (23 if the searcher is unfamiliar with firearms). Reduce the DC by 5pts if the weapon is actually physically handled.</p>

<p>The weapon is somewhat smaller and less accurate than a true pistol, and inflicts a -2 to hit on the wielder. Loading the hilt-pistol requires two Move Equivalent actions.</p>

<p>The Heavy Pistol is a larger version of the normal weapon, often carried by assault troops storming enemy implacemcements. It resembles a normal pistol, but is larger and heavier, and has a steel bulb on the end of its hilt, allowing it to be used as a club in combat (the user reverses his grip on the weapon and wields it by the hilt).</p>

<p>The Heavy Pistol has two barrels. These can be discharged individually or together – the latter inflicts a -2 penalty on the hit roll, but does 2d10 damage. Loading a breach pistol requires two Move Equivalent actions for each barrel.</p>

<p>The Longwrath rifled aquebus is an advanced version of the standard firearm. All Longwraths are masterwork quality and grant +1 to hit rolls. It fires specialised ‘pointed’ shot, which spins in the barrel and flight to give it additional stability and range. The longwrath is traditionally issued only to specialised scouts and marksmen.</p>

Charge Required: 10</span></p>

<p>The ogre gun is a massive firearm, like an oversized pistol with a trumpet-like-barrel, used mainly by ogres. It is incapable of anything resembling accuracy, but spreads shot over a wide area. Medium-sized creatures suffer a -4 penalty if using the ogre gun in one hand. It uses about 10 packets of powder and shot, but can also be loaded with just about anything (stones, glass, shards of metal): in this case reduce the damage to 5d4. It can also be loaded with rocksalt, which transforms its damage from lethal to subdual.</p>

<p>The ogre gun inflicts 5d4 damage to all targets in a 50ft long cone. For every 10ft away from the weapon, the target takes 1 dice less damage. All potential targets can make a Ref Save, DC equal to the attacker’s hit roll, for half damage.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Availability: D<br />
Cost: 100gp<br />
Wgt: 10</span></p>

<p>Solmite explosive is a charge of refined solarium contained in a thin wooden barrel. Ignited by fuse of a magical fire attack, solmite explosives creates significant force as well as heat and fire. A barrel produces an explosion of 5d6 force damage and 5d6 fire damage to all creatures within a 30ft radius.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Petard</span></p>

<p>A special form of charge is called a petard, which directs the force of the explosion in a particular direction. This version of the bomb directs the force in front of where the explosive is placed. This halves the Hardness of any object that the bomb is placed against. Petards are used in siege warfare to destroy castle gates and fortifications, and come with a carrying harness. Petardier’s Apprentice is possibly the most dangerous assignment in the Harmonium – carry the primed bomb to its location in mid-battle. The symbol of their profession is the Petardier’s Belt, which is essentially a 30ft rope with a knot on the end, which trails out behind the unlucky soldier as he runs, indicating ‘safe distance’ for any troops accompanying them.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>My immediate reaction is that I very much like most of what you've done here.  My secondary reaction is the fact that some of this threatens to turn Ortho into something it shouldn't be and that's Steampunk.  </p>

<p>Some basic things that shouldn't exist in Ortho as far as I'm concerned are the following...</p>

<p>1. <span style="font-weight:bold">Trains</span>:  A great deal of the Harmonium's feel is the fact that they have a world wide organization but they're rather restricted their own provinces and the law has difficulty catching up with those who can travel.  </p>

<p>2. <span style="font-weight:bold">Airships</span>: Likewise, these make the setting seem too Final Fantasy or Eberron-esque.  They also revolutionize the nature of commerce and make the world, again, too small when a major theme is its too big.</p>

<p>3. <span style="font-weight:bold">Mechanical Men</span>: In addition to the Warforged bit, the Harmonium strike me as the types to have all sorts of objections to the idea of creating life on moral grounds.  Just look at the fervor over cloning.</p>

<p>4. <span style="font-weight:bold">Rifles</span>: I have no doubt that the Harmonium has access to some smokepowder weaponry but this should be primarilly from Outer Planes where they've observed it.  A good idea would be implying the Harmonium is experimenting with gunpowder's military applications.</p>

<p>5. <span style="font-weight:bold">Steam Engines</span>: Everything should still be sailing ship.</p>

<p>So definitely closer to Renassiance and less Victorian</p>

<p>I like the Beholder "peace bardings' best of all.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

          Ortho: Technology &amp; Equipment        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>As a general response, I think there was a consensus (before I joined actually) that Ortho would have a higher technological level than standard D&amp;D, partly to show the advances possible under a world government and partly because Ortho's lessened magic (fantasy's long standing <span style="font-style:italic">high technology balances dying magic </span>trope). Airships and firearms are specific examples of this in the early PDF document. </p>

<p>I agree that we don't want to create a steampunk setting, but I think there are stylistic aspects to steampunk that we're not going to include, and which we can avoid while still including better technology. Also, saying that there are airships and firearms is not the same as saying they are common or easilly available... but I'l admit that I probably don't say it clearly in the document. I couldn't comment on Eberron specifially because I know nothing about it. I'm certainly not aping Eberron (I can't, I've never read it) and <span style="font-style:italic">hopefully </span>when we're done here Ortho will have sufficient flavour of its own to counteract any similarities in tech level.</p>

<p>From a D&amp;D balance point of view, most of the technology here is designed to replace magic that would fulfill the same function in a normal world. The 'fading magic' theory means that Ortho lacks a lot of the showy magics that populate other worlds, and OCA restrictions limit and restrict magical items. Most items of advanced technology are just replacing one magical boomstick with another kind. At least, that's the theory...</p>

<p>Specific comments:</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Trains</span>:  I agree. But I haven't written anything about trains! I guess this is a "if they can be mobile, won't they just use steamhorses to push carriages?" point, which is a fair point. There's a big difference between a traction engine and a train, but the engines probably need to be rarer (and less reliable) than I've implied. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Airships</span>: They do indeed make the world smaller and revolutionise trade. A big part of the setting is that the world <span style="font-style:italic">is </span>smaller - interlinked, peaceful, and prosperous; essentially 'one community' (at least in theory). Semaphore towers are another example.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Mechanical Men: </span>Golems (sorry, <span style="font-style:italic">'automatons'</span>) have a writeup mainly because they are an example of the fusion of magic and technology. The same kind of magical exploitation that goes on in most D&amp;D worlds, but mass produced. I wouldn't be too horrified to see them go if there's a general consensus against them. The whole gear spirits over elemental spirits issue is designed to get around the moral question of constructs though.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Rifles</span>: Smokepowders also a big feature of Spelljammer (and technically Ortho is a spelljamming power), and another easy example of advanced technology. Your comments about them still experimenting with smokepowder probably needs inclusion however. I definitely wasn't saying that firearms are common, so if it comes across that way it needs tweaking.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Steam Engines: </span>I think you're probably right about the shipping. I'll reign back ironclads to sailing vessels with armour (the earliest form), and emphasise the ongoing experimentation rather than saying that they're on the verge of full Victorian steamships. I don't see any problem with expensive small steamhorse-driven boats however, for the same 'tech not magic' reason given above.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Thanks for the input; I always take it onboard even if I argue against it.  <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/lol.png" title="Laughing out loud" alt="Laughing out loud" class="smiley-content"/>  I guess I should throw the steampunk question open now: anybody else feel strongly one way or the other?</span></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Eberron is a "Magepunk" or "Magitek" setting. They don't have trains and zeppelins,, but magic trains and flying boats. Eberron is actually one of the most magical settings out there. They even added a new NPC class, the magewright, just to run it all. As long as we emphasize the <span style="font-style:italic">technological</span> advances such as gunpowder (which I'm considering just calling gunpowder. I'm sick of all the funny euphemisms people come up with for it), we won't have much confusion. Plus there is difference of tone. Eberron is done in the style of over-the-top pulp adventure and isn't meant to be taken entirely seriously, whereas the Ortho PDF currently reads more like a really interesting civics text book. </p>

<p>As for the steam punk thing, the hallmark of Steampunk is having nineteenth century technology be capable of things that are impossible or barely possible now. Steam powered robots, time machines, giant mechanical insects, etc. As long as we stick with things that would be possible and practical within the appropriate tech level we should avoid the genre. </p>

<p>I like the idea of having the tech level of say, 1800. So we have flintlocks, muskets, carbines, cannons and early rifles, but not revolvers, repeating rifles, gattling guns or howitzers. Semaphore, but not telegraph; early steam boats (maybe used by the Harmonium), but not ironclads or ocean going ones; scouting balloons, but not zeppelins; seed drills, but not mechanical reapers; steam power, but not oil or electricity, and so on.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>You make a good point about the swords and crossbows. While I could make up an explanation for the discrepency, it would be just an excuse and we'd all know it.

         <p>Pretty much every D&amp;D setting exists in a state known as <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalStasis" class="bb-url">Medieval Stasis</a>. Basically, the current tech level in a given setting will be a poorly researched version of the early Renaissance (nevermind that the average D&amp;D <span style="font-style:italic">society</span> is suspiciously Iron Age). The weirdest part though, is that it's generally implied that their tech level has been that way for the last millennium or so. They switch it up some. Spelljammer had more magic and gunpowder added to the mix, Dark Sun was more post-apocalyptic, and Eberron has a higher (magical) tech level. But in general, every setting from Forgotten Realms to Planescape is permanently stuck in this weird approximation of Medieval Europe. Frankly, it's stupid.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Planescape provides a ready excuse. The planes are built on belief, so if most people in the multiverse believe that the trebuchet is the hight of military technology, then, guess what, it is! Sure the average Sigilite isn't going to care much what a bunch of backplane primes think, but belief still seeps through, and if everyone believes that gunpowder weapons are unreliable and slow to load, then that fancy new assault rifle you picked up on a trip to Earth isn't going to work any better than your average arquebus.</p>

<p>If a belief bases explanation doesn't fit, then you could always just say that firearms are expensive and unreliable and the average Harmonium officer doesn't need more than a crossbow anyway. Elite troops and front-line soldiers on the other hand, can be <span style="font-style:italic">quite</span> well outfitted.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>"The Harmonium tends to use crossbows and blades on Sigil due to the repeated encounters with Outsiders that they are forced to involve themselves in.  As yet, no one has successfully created a enchanted rifle or powder pistol.  Furthermore, enchanted arms are overall as effective as powder weapons.  The Harmonium has successfully enchanted cannon shot and these have been used in great effect against fiends in Sigil and during the Faction War."</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

          Ortho: Technology &amp; Equipment        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><span style="font-weight:bold">EDIT: <br />
An updated version of this section has moved 'up' the thread now, and is incorporated in an earlier post.</span></p>

<p>You don't <span style="font-style:italic">have </span>to inscribe magical runes on shot - or any other magical item for that matter. The rules are 'wonderfully' vague on teh whole subject. There's simply no reason why you can't enchant shot (o guns) in the basic rules. Ortho also has links to an already existing setting (Spelljammer) where magical firearms are actually fairly prevelant. Fortunately we have plenty of legal/social restrictions in place to keep Ortho from becoming too gun-heavy instead (that's definitely <span style="font-style:italic">not </span>the idea). I <span style="font-style:italic">deeply </span>appreiate your point of not turning Ortho into the Wild West, and especially not the 'Wild Wild West'</p>

<p>But anyway.... in the spirit of xmas i bring toys - for Orthorian PCs, anyway. None of them are guns, though <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/lol.png" title="Laughing out loud" alt="Laughing out loud" class="smiley-content"/></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">These items aren't exactly mind-blowing in terms of creativity; many of them are just new varients of existing items or me playing with the item creation rules. I've tried to include at least a little "bardic knowledge" to tie each entry to Ortho however, which is the main point of having a magic item section in the PDF, I think.</span> </p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-weight:bold">Alaetine Staff </span></span></p>

<p>These long white staves are carried by itinerant priestesses of Alae to defend their honour and their lives in time of need. Topped with the goddess’ symbol in steel, each stave is imbued with the Goddess’ merciful touch. Orthorian law does not consider them weapons.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Powers: </span>An Alaetine Stave is a Merciful Quarterstaff +1, which can invoke Sanctuary spell on its wielder once per day. When carried by a chaste and pious priestess of Alae, this weapon also counts as a holy symbol of that deity.</p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-weight:bold">Alzrian Toothpick</span></span></p>

<p>It was Varzak of the Crushing Fist who gave such a mocking name to so terrible a weapon as this, when he experienced their effects first hand in the retaking of Iathra. The orcs give high praise to those able to laugh in the face of danger, and the phrase “Varzak’s laugh” has entered the Motmurk lexicon as a term of respect for one who shows know fear in the face of certain doom. </p>

<p>Although never exactly numerous, these weapons were all too often seen in the war against the Master of Brands. Thankfully most of them were taken and destroyed when Alzrius’ earthly minions were defeated. A handful of these relics still survive however, sought after with all-consuming lust by his remaining cultists; legend says that entire cabals exist simply to re-aquire these lost relics.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Powers: </span>The Alzrian Toothpick is a shaft of eternally red-hot iron, whose head burns constantly with vile abyssal flames (unlike a normal flaming weapon, it cannot be turned off). It functions as an Unholy Flaming, Flame Burst, Returning Shortspear +1. When thrown, the weapon seems to disappear on impact in an explosion of fire – but at the same instant it vanishes from the body of a victim, it reappears in a flash of flame in the thrower’s hand.</p>

<p>Caster Level: 12TH<br />
Prerequisites: Craft Arms &amp; Armours, Fireball or Flamestrike, Telekinesis, Unholy Blight.<br />

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-weight:bold">Shell Armour of Sealord</span></span></p>

<p>While many Seaborn Exiles utilise suits of Shell Armour in battle (especially marines), only a lucky few have enchanted sets provided by their Mer allies. Armour of the Sealord is usually carved with elegant flowing images of beneath the waves, and inset with pearl and slivers of rare coral. Although its protective enchantment is minimal, it has many other useful properties. </p>

<p>Like most such items, both Exiles and Mer will want to know exactly how the wearer came by such suit, which is another icon of the ancient alliance between the Seaborn and the Mer.</p>

<p>Powers: Armour of the Sealord is a suit of Shell Armour +1, which grants a +5 bonus to Swim checks and allows the wearer to breathe underwater. Finally, it also absorbs the first 10 points of cold damage per attack that the wearer would normally take (similar to the resist energy spell).</p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-weight:bold">Arrow of the Viper</span></span></p>

<p>Arrows of the Viper are found primarily in the Thaeran Isles, although who exactly makes these deadly weapons is unknown. The tips are green-tinged iron, the shaft is painted with shamanistic designs, and the flights are brightly coloured feathers from Thaeran jungle birds: The materials may be primitive, but they are assembled with masterful skill and significant magical knowledge. They are of course, highly illegal.</p>

<p>Arrows of the Viper are favoured by assassins and rebels. They are traded on the black market in small numbers, and can be obtained from nefarious sources throughout the Thaeran Provinces (although easiest in the Isles). Exactly who makes these weapons remains unknown – it’s just one more of many mysteries among the Isles.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Powers: </span>Arrows of the Viper are +1 Arrows. On striking their target, they unleash a Poison effect on their victim: This deals 1d10ts of temporary CON damage immediately and another 1d10pts one minute later. Each instance of damage can be negated by a Fortitude Save, DC 17. </p>

<p>Caster Level: 9TH<br />

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-weight:bold">Assassin’s Sheath</span></span></p>

<p>This enchanted scabbard is used by freefolk and criminals, not all of them assassins – but its infamy is indelibly connected with the Thief Lords and their murderous wiles. The Harmonium also uses such devices occasionally - although not for assassination, it claims. Diplomats and Exigency Teams have used Assassin’s Sheaths to provide them with an unexpected advantage when a supposedly peaceful parley suddenly became a murderous melee.</p>

<p>An Assassin’s Sheath looks like a normal, if somewhat ornate, scabbard. Several styles exist, each suitable for a particular style of weapon (dagger, longsword, and bastard sword being the most common). The command word is sometimes worked into the scabbard on the side which rests against the wearer. When this is not the case, the pattern on the scabbard usually alludes to the word in some way.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Powers: </span>When the command word is spoken, the scabbard and any weapon in it shrink to miniscule size, effectively becoming part of the belt they are attached to; only a Search check at DC 30 can spot them in this state. The scabbard and weapon can be willed back to normal size with but a thought (a free action). The scabbard can also invoke a True Strike effect once per day on a weapon being drawn from it. The scabbard can be shrunk or enlarged any number of times per day.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold"><span style="font-size:18px">Boots of the Mountainrunner</span></span>	</p>

<p>The hedge-wizards and wise-women of the Hhuanu tribes make these split-toed fur boots for their scouts, out of only the finest hide and furs. With the coming of the Harmonium and the rise of urbanised life and trade, these items are now in wider circulation, produced by Marn and foreign wizards. The traditional Hhuanu style is still renowned as the most comfortable and reliable, however.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Powers: </span>These sturdy boots are warm and comfortable in even the bitterest cold, granting +1 to Saves versus Cold. They allow the wearer to move easier across mountainous terrain: The wearer moves at full overland speed on Mountain highways, paths and trails, and at ¾ normal over trackless terrain (see PHB for more details). On the tactical scale, ignore the effects of ‘difficult terrain’ when this is caused by rocky mountains.</p>

<p>Boots of the Mountainrunner also know the way back to the area in which they were created. This is certainly not an exact sense and only draws the wearer to the rough local area (about 10 miles diameter), but the user will always have an innate sense for the boots’ home, similar to that granted by the Know Direction spell. This is a continuous effect.</p>

<p>The Bow of Retribution is crafted in the image of Saeduenical’s own magical longbow, Far Retribution. It is said that the string is woven from the goddess’ own hair and never frays of breaks. Like many of Saeduenical’s artefacts, a Bow of Retribution is seen most often in the hands of her Sinhunters – although the church also sometimes loans these weapons to harmonium troopers charged with bringing down a particularly dangerous foe. It is said that Saeduencial herself is reluctant to allow these weapons to be used, for the oblivion they inflict can almost be considered a mercy when compared to eternal imprisonment in her harsh and terrible realm.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Powers: </span>A Bow of Retribution is a +2 Mighty Composite Longbow (designed for a +4 Str bonus). Any arrow fired from it becomes an Arrow of Slaying. Slain targets are utterly destroyed both body and soul. </p>

<p>The Bulawa, or ceremonial mace, is the symbol of Tyerusus, Lord of Judgement. Its current form originated in Motmurk, where priests and shamans used the Bulawa as both a literal and figurative rod of authority to keep order in tribal councils. Each tribe of Motmurk still keeps a Bulawa among its regalia, in honour of this ancient tradition.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Powers: </span>A Bulawa is a Lawful Heavy Mace +2. Once per day the wielder can call upon the Lord of Judgement to invoke Protection from Chaos.</p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-weight:bold">Champion’s Scabbard</span></span></p>

<p>The original Champion’s Scabbards were created at the behest of Lord Xiang Zhou, Chamberlain of the Court of Han, who fostered the first alliance between the Knights of Harmony and the state of Iironda. After his death the court wizards of the Gem-Studded City took it upon themselves to continue this work, until it became an enduring tradition of the city. The giving of Champion’s Scabbards is now a prestigious annual event, with numerous Houses competing for the honour of sponsoring these gifts.</p>

<p>Each Champion’s Scabbard was (and is) created for a specific hero of the Harmonium – from famous champions and diplomats to humble footsoldiers who distinguished themselves above and beyond the call of duty. The scabbard is plated in red gold and carved with the receiver’s heraldry.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Powers: </span>The wearer may invoke Magic Weapon and Keen Edge once per day upon a weapon in the scabbard.</p>

<p>The Crusader’s Blessing is an enchantment used by servants of all the Lords of Order, including external deities on the Harmonium’s accepted list such as Saint Cuthbert. It invokes the names of Didairdin and other goodly warrior-gods like Hieroneous upon a weapon, turning it into a permanent icon of law and good faith.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Powers: </span> Crusader’s Blessing is a +1 value enchantment that can be applied to any weapon. It duplicates the effects of a Bless Weapon spell, raising the effective plus of the weapon by +1 with regards to penetrating the Damage Reduction of evil creatures (but does not provide an additional combat bonus). The weapon is also counted as being Good for the purposes of overcoming Damage Reduction, and critical threats are automatically confirmed when they strike evil creatures. The weapon also functions as a Lawful Good holy symbol.</p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-weight:bold">Deathwalker Mask</span></span></p>

<p>Deathwalker Masks are ancient magic from the Age of Cabals, when undead sorcerers walked among the populace and manipulated nations as if they were mere pieces on a game-board. The mask is made from another creature’s face, cut from the still-living flesh of the victim. It allows an undead creature to pass as human to both mundane and magical means. Rumours persist that in ancient times the elves also had a version of this item, allowing them to pass secretly among humanity.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Powers: </span>Creates the appearance of the living person from whom the mask was made, similar to the spell Disguise Self. The wearer does not register as undead to spells such as Deathwatch and Detect Undead while wearing the mask, which also suppresses certain undead traits which would give away the disguise, such as a Lich’s aura of death and fear. The mask can be worn for up to a month, absorbing all the rot and putrid corruption of the undead. When removed, the Deathwalker Mask instantly crumbles into a pile of mould. </p>

<p>The use of powerful undead abilities (Energy Drain, A lich’s Aura or Paralysing Touch, etc) causes the mask to degrade prematurely (1d6 hours – or 1d6 minutes for cases of repeated power use).</p>

<p>Devotees of the cult of Alzrius often wield these wavy-bladed daggers of burnished steel. Wounds from a Fire-Runner Knife burn as if the blood is boiling and the flesh aflame; pain crackling like lightning through the victim’s body. They are used in mainly in the cult’s rituals, to inflict tortuous deaths upon sacrifices.</p>

<p>Powers: These weapons function as +1 Daggers. The wounds they cause are so painful that every time a victim is wounded by the knife, they must make a Fortitude Save at DC 10 + the damage inflicted or be stunned with pain for 1 round.</p>

<p>Ghoulslayer Swords are issued by the city of Han the Gem-Studded, as a standing reward for anyone who can permanently destroy one of the cursed ships of the Ghoul Fleet. Each is a gorgeously jewelled scimitar, engraved with runes sacred to Tyerusus and the name of whoever earned it.</p>

<p>Despite the status these weapons grant in Han, several of them have ended up on the open market when their owners later found themselves in need of gold. Ghoulslayers are often purchased by rich adventurers and naval captains who would like to earn another such blade legitimately from the Lords of Han, because those who serve the city in this way often earn a lucrative patronage from a merchant House.</p>

<p>The Helm of the Emberhawk is made of burnished steel, with a red plume of its namesake’s feathers and a beaklike visor that gives the wearer an avian appearance. It was contributed to the Harmonium armouries by an otherwise reclusive (human) wizard from northern Keln, by the name of Anok Sabé. She was one of the first humans to colonise Keln after the Beholder hegemony joined the Alliance of Harmony, and her tower still stands today, perched precariously on one of a towering peaks. Many historians believe that a regular supply of Helms of the Emberhawk was the price she negotiated to be left alone by the beholders. As a consequence these items are readily available in the bazaars of Keln, Bafatai, and Kharazam.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Powers: </span>The Helm provides no additional bonus to AC, but two useful benefits: Once per day the wearer can summon a Young Emberhawk (see the Ortho Bestiary for more details) to serve him as if by means of Summon Monster IV. Secondly, the avian magic of Anok Sabé grants the user a permanent Feather Fall effect, which automatically activates if the wearer falls more than 5ft.</p>

<p>No one knows exactly how these oddly-named items found their way in the arsenal of Ortho’s thieves and Freefolk. Hullwalker Boots enable even the most clumsy rogue (or thug) to evade pursuit or begin a thriving career in second-storey work. Due to the depredations of rogues armed with this item, the Harmonium have categorised it as a Class E item – possession is grounds for immediate arrest.</p>

<p>Many believe the name stems from some nautical (mis)adventure by an unknown freeblade. Sadly his or her name has not survived, but their boots have. Copies of the original are available from various disreputable sources among the Free.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Powers:</span> These calf-length magical boots look like they’d belong on a stereotypical sea captain’s feet. They stick to any surface to user wills them too, adhering so strongly that the wearer can walk up walls and even stand on a chamber’s ceiling. In fact they stick so hard that the wearer requires significant extra effort to take every step: half the wearer’s movement while the Boots are activated.</p>

<p>The Midewwin Bag is a sacred satchel carried by Hazhkan’s tribal hunters. Created by tribal shamans (these days often converts to the Lords of Order), the bag is attached to a bead-embroidered cloth that wraps around the waist. Into the bag go the bones of totem animals and other secret magical ingredients, and the bag itself is made from a specific animal’s skin (see below). The bag is sealed with a complicated sacred knots, and it’s forbidden for anyone but a Hazhkan shaman to open them. </p>

<p>Midewwin bags grant the wearer spiritual aid in hunting the type of creature that the bag is dedicated to (identified by the skin used to make the bag). In this enlightened age, bags created from intelligent races are of course forbidden by law. Unfortunately a few ‘Bad Midewwin Bags’ (created from the skin of intelligent races) are available on the black market, made by unscrupulous shamans and witchdoctors.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Powers:</span> A Midewwin Bag is worn as a belt. It grants the wearer use of the Favoured Enemy bonus (as a 1St level Ranger) against the specific race of creature that the bag is dedicated to. If this creature would normally be subject to a favoured enemy bonus from the wearer, then they calculate their bonus as if they were 5 levels higher. </p>

Produced by tribal ‘medicine men’ for their warriors, these one-shot minor magical items have proved incredibly popular in the rest of Ortho. As well as being a valuable resource for newly civilised tribes, their popularity has attracted many foreign wizards in search of their secrets. </p>

<p>Among the scrupulous merchants of Ortho, it is tradition to seal important contracts with an oath upon a relic of the Lords of Order. These icons were created to assist that purpose. They are also used by diplomats and peace-makers to seal accords between nations, colonies, and provinces.</p>

<p>An Oath Seal is essentially an enormous holy symbol, dedicated to all the Lords of Order. It resembles a two-handed mace with a shaft of red steel and an eight-faced head, upon each side of which is the divine symbol of one of the Lords of Order. These symbols are worked in silver, but change colour when an oath is spoken by someone touching the Seal. If they speak the truth, the symbols turn golden; if the speaker lies, they turn inky black. Traditionally each side of the negotiations requests an Oath Seal from their favoured church, which is sworn on by the other party.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Powers: </span>The Discern Lies effect is useable only per day (the colour change lasts 24 hours). Although not specifically designed for it, Oath Seals can also be wielded in combat: Treat it as a Great Club+1 with the special property that it becomes a +3 weapon and does +2d6 damage against any target it has revealed as a liar within the last 24 hours. </p>

Since that time Didairdin’s Blessing has been used by his clerics to clear land for farming and to cultivate new crops.

They are used to capture powerful spellcasters and supernatural creatures, eliminating any powers beyond mere physical might. They first saw use during the pacification of the colony world of Meter, being used to capture the powerful Demarcator mages of that empire, but since then their use has spread significantly. Most major cities or Provinces have access to a set of shackles (but rarely more than one) in case of supernatural trouble.

<p>Speculums are scrying devices designed to allow 2-way communication between distant locations. These items are the exclusive province of dignitaries of the Council of Ortho, the Octave, and certain other major dignitaries – such as ambassadors and legates. Although harmless and used simply for communication by officials, rumours exist of ‘Master Mirrors’ which can eavesdrop on active mirrors without their knowledge.</p>

<p>Physically, a speculum resembles a full-length mirror of masterwork quality, framed by a red-gold boarder set with azurite, diopside, and apatite (all crystals that aid in divination magic). The glass is 3ft wide and 6ft high.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Powers:</span> By touching the glass and concentrating on activating its magic, a mystical connection is forged between a pair of attuned mirrors. Those stood before each speculum can communicate as easily as if the mirrored glass were an open doorway between two adjoining rooms. Communication is two way and not restricted to the activator/owner of the speculum; anyone in the vicinity can see and hear through the glass. Once activated, a speculum’s link can be maintained with minimal mental effort for as long as the initiator wishes. </p>

<p>Each Speculum is attuned to a one other of its kind, and only communicates with that Speculum. The attunement can be reset between two different mirrors, by a relatively simple ritual that involves casting Greater Scry while touching both mirrors.</p>

<p>The Wyverntail is a length of light chain, tipped with a triangular blade, somewhere between a dagger and a shortsword in length.

<p>Nahr-aglar means ‘shining glory’ in the cruel elfish tongue. It was created by Dowager Queen Nahnehth, last ruler of the Western Shaar in the latter days of the War of Unification. After suffering several major defeats in the war (including the loss of her beloved son, Fuin Mor), Queen Nahnehth created Nahr-aglar to reverse the defeats of her people and lead the elves to glorious victory. The Knights of Harmony were a match even for its deadly magic, but the sword was never claimed by the Knights or their followers; it was carried away from the battlefield by an unnamed elven deserter after the last Champion of the Shaars was killed. Unheard of for years afterwards, it resurfaces from time to time to plague the heirs of Romhel; always somehow managing slip out of their grasp as if protected by fate or the Lords of Chaos. The Harmonium would give a great deal to see it finally destroyed, and this alone has given Nahr-aglar legendary status among the Harmonium’s enemies.</p>
