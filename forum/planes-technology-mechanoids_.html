</div> <p>OK, so this thread is multifaceted - it covers all things related to technology and its various sub-elements, and includes (but is not limited to):<br />
<ul class="bb-list" style="list-style-type:circle;"><li>Player Races</li>
<li>Classes / Prestige Classes</li>
<li>Factions (new or otherwise)</li>
<li>Skills, Feats, Abilities</li>
<li>Equipment &amp; Magic Items</li>
<li>Spells, Powers, other</li>
<li>Monsters (constructs, living constructs, mechanoids)</li>
<li>Divinities and Domains</li>
<li>Tech types and traits (I got this one pretty much done, but could use review)</li>
<li>Campaign ideas or setting elements to utilize tech concepts</li></ul></p>

<p>I will begin with some information on Modrons first - including some illustrations I am making for them - but I have to upload, so I need a minute.  Please be patient, and I will post them in another following response.</p>

<p>To be clear, this is not for a purely SF campaign, and it in no way should rely ENTIRELY on the PSCS, but should be relatively transparent with the 3.5 rules of such.  This was originally developed for another homebrew cosmology, but deals with issues that could easily be placed in Mechanus or another tech-dominant outer plane, a new demiplane, in the transitive planes, or even on the Prime Material worlds.  The Pyrrothian Cosmology is a variant cosmos centered around the world of Pyrroth.  You are not required in any way to put forth information specifically concerning this new cosmology, since I am aware that none of you know too much about it yet.  <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/wink.png" title="Eye-wink" alt="Eye-wink" class="smiley-content"/></p>

<p>I am taking comments and input, and when some more is posted, I would love to hear your thoughts, especially on Modrons and their homebrew Outer Planes successors, the Omnati &amp; Quixoti, on the tech types &amp; their traits I have been developing recently, and on anything new that you think might also be helpful.  I can also say that some of my ideas were more recently influenced by the Mechanus ecology set up on <a href="_.html">Plugin &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Not Found</a>, but again - this is not necessary for the uses of this material.</p>

<p>Be back soon with pictures!  ;D<br />

<div><div class="collapse-text-text collapsed-text"><p>Alrighty - all images are made with two profiles; the one on the left is a front view of a fully-composed modron (or at least mostly composed and featuring most of its parts together or near to where they should be), and the split-up components on the right of that figure are all the same pieces or else similar renderings from the left-hand side of the Modron.</p>

<p>Beginning with the Monodrone:
</div><fieldset class="collapse-text-fieldset collapsed-text-fieldset collapsible collapsed"><legend>Monodrone illustration description</legend><div class="collapse-text-text collapsed-text"><ul class="bb-list" style="list-style-type:circle;"><li>He has standard spindly legs with cup-shaped feet, something which is interchangeable with the Duodrones, and with exiled rogue Quadrones.  They mount on the side of a body exterior with a set of sovereign wheels circling a rod-like shaft (axle-pin)  with some limited amount of left-right motion against the mounting shaft to help with advanced walking locomotion.  Their feet are permanently attached saucers (ovoid plated cups) based from the same concepts as the higher grade legs, but without a locking-unlocking foot mechanism (as with Tridrones / Pentadrones).</li>
<li>Basic spherical shell that only Monodrones use.  The rear section has a storage space made specifically for repair tools and spare parts.  Monodrones cannot repair themselves, as it is typically part of the duties of Duodrones.</li>
<li>Standard spindly arms of the same basic style as the legs, with the locking mechanism at the end fitted into small utilitarian (humanoid) hands.  The arms do not require the same mounting piece that the legs do, because of less weight restrictions, and do not have sovereign wheels.</li>
<li>A Monodrone typically does not automatically receive flight-active wings, but instead receives a pair of flightless mini-wings that are mostly for balance, equilibrium upsets (meaning they help to get back up falling over on one's side), and for simple deflective defense against aerial attacks / grapples - not the best, but good enough for some attacks made against them from above.  These mini-wings are sometimes given to exiled rogues modrons instead of standard flight-active wings, depending on availability when exiled.  Some Monodrones have no wings at all, though this is not standard.</li>
<li>Recognizeable internal features include the eyeball and flesh plates, which make up the facial profile inside a segmented circular face tray.  Flesh is made from a rubber silicate compound, and eyeballs are made from a two jelly forms (internal), and an acrylic silicate compound shell.  These parts are interchangeable with many other castes (most Modrons have standard eyeballs), and the flesh plates can be somewhat stretched to fit other shapes of the same basic size.  Most Monodrone facial parts are directly congruent to basic Duodrone parts.  Mouths are simply flesh plates that have motion mechanisms behind them and an open slit made to wrap around those mechanisms.</li>
<li>Hidden internal parts include human-like teeth, tongue, and mouth motion mechanisms, gears and internal wiring (fluff material, pictured in all Modrons as a dark shaped mass without additional detail), eyeball mounts &amp; scrubbers / squeegies, a standard Modron Filament Core (the circular object which has a crossed diamond and smaller circle inside it), and a repair kit storage space - which includes tools and spare parts inside a simple latched, enclosed space with a hatch for outer access by Duodrones.</li>
<li>A standard Modron Filament Core can be found in each of the Base Modrons, as well as many of the Hierarch Modrons, and is a spherical object that is incredibly difficult to open and access its interior.  If opened, it immediately shuts down all energy, functions, and communications between the Modron and the Infinity Web, to which it is also connected.  It has an inner chamber that is shaped generally like an equilateral octohedron, which delicately and firmly holds a single looped strand of the Infinity Web, to which Primus and the Energy Pool of Regulus are connected.  From it, many other silvery wires connect the filament to the mechanical plugs leading to the Core's outside; it has 14 plugs in total - one for each side of the inner octohedron, and one for each vertex.  On the outside, these plugs are directly connected to a Modron's most important internal structures and mechanisms.  It is both the energy source and intelligence source for the Modron, and when it ceases to function, the Modron is no longer active.  Reactivating a Modron is something that can only be done in Regulus by Primus, using the Energy Pool and Infinity Web in a manner typical to creating or upgrading any other Modron.</li>
<li>I forgot to include spectacle mounts on these guys, but they are shown with them all over the place...  I assume they are placed very near to eyeball, and would be easy to add to the current setup without a hassle.</li></ul></div></fieldset>
<div class="collapse-text-text collapsed-text">

<p>Okay, the Duodrone is next.
</div><fieldset class="collapse-text-fieldset collapsed-text-fieldset collapsible collapsed"><legend>Duodrone illustration description</legend><div class="collapse-text-text collapsed-text"><ul class="bb-list" style="list-style-type:circle;"><li>You might notice that this guy looks nothing like the original AD&amp;D Duodrone, and only somewhat similar to the Duodrone featured in Dragon v.318.  This one is designed as described in the WotC Web Enhancement for Manual of the Planes, as having 'one eye and one mouth' on its 'blocky, rectangular body'.  I incorporated the two descriptions together, and gave a little flexibility in how their faces appear.  The version in Dragon v.318 has a full two eyes, nostrils and mouth in one face plate (which is the one that is exchanged with some Quadrones and most exiled rogue Quadrones) - and this one is the standard model.</li>
<li>When upgraded, a new Duodrone receives the facial segments used in its Monodrone form, stretched somewhat and fitted to its new form.  The eyeball and flesh plates above the Monodrone eye become the upper face plate (with a new grate or 'rack' to hold them in place), and the mouth and its original rack is used on the bottom section.  Some internal parts, such as the teeth and tongue (and connecting 'fluff' mechanisms) can also be salvaged and re-used from its former state.</li>
<li>You'll notice a faint vertical line between a set of front panels and an alternative set in the side profile.  The ones on the left (closest to the front profile) are the ones shown in Dragon v.318 - a metal plate bottom half, and a full-faced upper half including two eyes, nose, and mouth in one horizontally placed segment.  These are not standard, but rather optional parts that might be utilized during inadequate parts supply, or simply to save time or resources.  The 'fluff' behind the full-face plate is adapted to meet the needs of the non-standard face, while the lower half simply remains more empty internally.</li>
<li>Connecting the two semi-cubic boxes of the body is a large cog-like screw with a screw-threaded tube with a ball bearing head.  This section allows the two boxes to move separate from one another, and the ball joint allows the upper box to tilt side to side in any direction up to around 25 degrees variance.  The threading allows it to spin and raise/lower, and the hollow tube connects wiring and mechanisms between the two body portions.</li>
<li>The Modron Filament Core rests in the lower segment, centered side to side and just in front of a repair kit storage space (containing specialized tools for Modron physiology, and a set of many varying spare parts for Monodrones, Duodrones, and Tridrones).</li>
<li>The wings on Duodrones are always standard flight-active wings, and in the event of their non-existence, no other arms or wings are ever put in their place to conserve resources.</li>
<li>The arms on Duodrones are much more sturdy and stronger than spindly arms, and are mounted from the top of the upper box portion of the body.  The mounting brackets are hinges, and each joint of the arms is able to rotate (swiveling sovereigns), and features a brake-style clasping disk to help keep movements strong, controlled, and to be stiff when held motionless.  These 'disks' are semi-circular gripping slides that fit into slots above the joint sovereigns, and lock into place and slide at an adjustable pace with two 'brake pads' placed inside the hollow arm above the sovereign.  This setup allows 360 degrees rotation around the joint, and over 180 degrees rotation around the hinge with the 'brake pad' circling exactly around that hinge.  Rotating more than 360 degrees around with the arm will of course cause damage, since the internal wiring and mechanisms cannot handle more than that much rotation at the joint sovereign - this is the only weakness of the design.  The hand is in all ways similar to the hand structure of the Monodrone's spindly hand, but it is somewhat fortified to deal with lifting heavier weights than the Monodrone is typically capable.</li>
<li>Duodrones receive the fortified spindly legs that Monodrones use, since they can easily support the weight of its body because of the sovereign wheels' flexibility and support.  Anything better than this is completely non-standard, and likely only used in times of dire need and low resources.</li>
<li>There is an antenna-like object placed on top of the head - I saw this in Dragon v.318 and don't know what it is, so it can stay or go.  I was not prepared to make the Base Modrons wireless creatures, but I don't know what else they could be....  Spectacle mounts?  I never saw any spectacles on them.</li></ul></div></fieldset>
<div class="collapse-text-text collapsed-text">

<p>And, for the Tridrone:
</div><fieldset class="collapse-text-fieldset collapsed-text-fieldset collapsible collapsed"><legend>Tridrone illustration description</legend><div class="collapse-text-text collapsed-text"><ul class="bb-list" style="list-style-type:circle;"><li>The first divergence I made here is that Dragon v.318's version of this guy gives him two legs on each side - a direct contradiction to the written descriptions of them from each version of D&amp;D, and most especially the most recent, v3.x.</li>
<li>This guy's arms are way better, and bigger than in Dragon v.318.  This is because of a dual-purpose (arms and as legs), and to help with the concept of stabilizing after a fall (this guy is top-heavy - he needs that!).</li>
<li>The Tridrone has a unique face grate (rack) for its triangular pyramidal shape with a separated upper segment for the facial portions (mouth, flesh plates, eyeball), a notch for the arm insert, and a lower segment that holds a bottom plate with a notch for the leg insert.  The inside of the racks and body is reinforced with steel rods - one on the inside of each lateral edge.  These rods connect with the middle fortification bar (the 'midway beam').  Three identical external bumper-style reinforcements that appear like hollowed pyramids and one longer version cap off each corner of the creature's strangely shaped body; these are about 3/8" (0.5cm) thick, and primarily to protect the internal beams from dislodging, and to keep the entire body together even during a hard fall.</li>
<li>A Tridrone's facial segments are largely remnants from its existence as a Monodrone and Duodrone.  The same 'fluff' mechanisms exist here - teeth, mouth motion, tongue, eyeball and eye scrubbers / squeegies.  I will take a minute here to describe how the eye scrubbing system works...  Most Base Modrons of Quadrones or lower caste do not typically have working eyelids or functional brows included standard.  If a Modron's eye become dusted, dirty, or gets something miniscule on its somewhat moist and often statically charged eyeball, it can simply roll it around 360 to use its internal scrubbing system.  On the top and left of the eyeball - soft, moist, spongy rolling scrubbers (like miniature paint rollers with sponges and a mild anti-static cleaning fluid on them) attract large pieces of minutia into their porous surfaces while also coating the eyeball in a light film of cleaning fluid.  On the bottom and right side of the eyeball, small window-wiper like squeegies slick away the fluid and any dirt, dust or other materials that might cause harm to the eye.  A simple rolling motion of the eye in a full circle in any direction activates this, beginning by rolling on fluid and grabbing large particles in the sponges, and ending with a slicking by the lower squeegies.  If you ever see a Modron roll its eyes up into the back of its head and back up from the bottom, followed by turning them both to the left side and doing the same in a side to side motion: they are not retrieving information from Primus, and they are not short-circuiting...  They are 'blinking' - or to us: quickly cleaning their eyeballs.  The scrubbers and squeegies are mounted on the same side on all eyeball 'fluff' to help ensure that the parts remain as accessible as possible during shortages or while more parts are being made; I originally thought of making them symmetrical in motion, but then thought against it for the sake of keeping parts completely interchangeable.</li>
<li>A Tridrone's Filament Core is situated just behind the mouth/eye mechanism, as low down as possible but still above the 'rollbar' or midway beam.  The midway beam acts as a reinforcement for the stability and durability of the body shape, a center of balance (for weight distribution), and as a support beam for the upper appendages (I would call them arms, but they double as legs too).  At the very bottom, a heavy hollow rhomboid keeps the center of balance from being too top-heavy, while still allowing debris from the eye-cleaning system to fall to the bottom, where it can be removed by removing the bottom corner-cap of the body; this is unique to the Tridrone composition - Monodrones and Duodrones remove the debris and carry it along small conveyor systems to their repair storage spaces, to be cleaned when the kits are accessed.</li>
<li>The Tridrone's primary concern during movement and activity is its shape and weight displacement, especially while moving overland and using its large and intricate upper appendages.  Because of this, it has seven internal gyroscopes - a characteristic unique to its body form.  There is one large primary gyroscope in the main body, just below the midway beam, and three smaller ones in the upper corners of the body, situated in between the very tips of the face plates and support rods.  The other three are placed inside the upper arm shaft, near to the 'elbow joint' and connecting the smaller shafts of wiring and mechanisms that tunnel through to the ends of the shaft (at the elbow region, after reaching the wrist region and coming back up the bladed footing / locking apparatus).  These gyroscopes spin constantly unless shut off for the purpose of turning or moving in a particular manner or direction, and they are situated on a pair of circular cogs that allow them to shift 360 degrees in any direction.  After falling over, a Tridrone's gyros also help to alleviate some of the weight distribution to the appendages, as having the cog sovereigns around them helping to change their alignment also causes it to be easier for them to stand upright once more.</li>
<li>The Tridrone's legs are considered the better leg system of the Base Modrons, and are used in the Tridrone, Quadrone, and Pentadrone body compositions.  Rogue Modron legs are often replaced with sub-standard spindly legs, and these ones are used on other Modrons.  They have mounting inserts similar to the ones used in the upper appendages, but they mount to the face plate and lower corner cap rather than a midway bar or support rod.  They are not built to lift heavy objects or run; they are simply built to walk with functional gyroscope activity and normal or slightly above normal body weight (holding around 25 pounds of objects / material).  They have footings at the ends of them that are useful as feet as well as simple hands (with an opposable thumb-like back-toe), and they can grip reinforced saucer footings similar to those found on spindly legs - except that these versions of the legs can let go of their footings, and they are placed into the repair storage space in the top of its body when not attached.  Unique joint mechanisms allow up to 45-degree variances in either direction (left or right of straight out), as well as allowing a full range of motion back and forth (straight out, pivoting at the hinge), in three separate places - the 'hip', 'knee', and 'pre-ankle'.  The 'true ankle' - the place where the back toe meets the 'foot' - can only move back and forth laterally in relation to the small foot connecting armature - known as the 'ankle armature', and allows the leg to shift its placement when the fortified footings are adorned (when the 'ankle' becomes the heel of the foot inside of the metal casing, where the toes grasp the internal components of the footing and hold it into place).  At the 'knee' of the legs, two sets of retractable claws can spin slowly out to be used as a defensive item - one set on set of the joint points one direction in a circle, and the opposite side's set points the opposite direction around the pivot of the joint (maybe +1 Claw 1d2 - 1d4 dmg).</li>
<li>The top face plate of the body is a solid plate with a circular opening that features a metal iris that can slide open and closed like a camera shutter.  This opening allows access to the Tridrone's repair kit area, featuring tools and spare parts, as well as the creature's footings which can be stored here during periods of no use.  Inside the storage space there is an upper dish wish a smaller dish placed at its bottom, and in the center of the lower dish is a cylindrical device which can raise and lower with extendable shafts placed one inside the other - this device holds the primary repair tools.  Tiny finger-like armatures extend and retract to move and relocate objects and spare parts, assisting the major appendages when they are grabbing for items in the open space.  To help see the parts inside, six smaller eyeballs face inward and remain active only when the top iris is open, also featuring smaller versions of the scrubbing systems of the other eyeballs - two of them are placed to the side of each corner mini-gyroscopes, allowing the creature to see in any direction inside its repair kit space (the are not helpful for external Spot checks).</li>
<li>The upper appendages of the Tridrone are the most remarkable feature, and a truly helpful upgrade from its previous states of existence.  As a set of arms, it can lift heavy objects with relative ease and reach in nearly any direction, including into the top repair kit space - which can often require the release action of the elbow mechanism in order to fully pivot around to the inner crevices of the kit space.  The upper arm is heavily reinforced, and features the secondary gyro for the arms, which is placed near to the 'elbow'.  A hollow shaft that extends all the way through all portions of the arm allows wiring and thin mechanisms to wind through it, connecting the arm gyro and mechanisms of the whole appendage to the inner Filament Core and allowing overall function of the arms.  The 'shoulder' joint allows a full 360-degree rotation around the joint, and a 180-degree up/down rotation at the hinge - the 'elbow' also has this ability, as well as an extended hinge rotation of almost 220-240 degrees.  The 'forearm' segment actually contains two distinct pieces of reinforced shafts - one simple forearm shaft, and one bladed footing armature known as a 'sub-forearm'; the latter piece pivots on the 'wrist' joint.  The hand, although pretty standard to the hands of the spindly arms and fortified Duodrone hands, are stronger and larger than the other varieties - when not in use, they retract against the forearm shaft with fingers curled inward.  The end of the 'sub-forearm' is the most impressive part of the appendage: it can be a blade, footing, or - when connected to the rest of the 'forearm' - a defensive gauntlet-style reinforced arm plating.  It is thick, retractable, and features a latching mechanism that doubles as a footing when the shaft is released to act as a spider-like leg.  The latch folds out to be a foot, folds inward to reveal the blade (and can lay flat against the inside of the 'sub-forearm' and even latch against it), and when folded partially inward and situated against the forearm shaft it acts and the latching mechanism for the 'forearm' as a whole.  A separate piece of the latch exists at the 'elbow' and also retracts during period of inactivity - this secondary latching level has a spongy pad on it to prevent the arm's quick retracting from causing shock damage to the appendage over time.</li></ul></div></fieldset>

<p>I think that covers it for this edition of Modrons 'R Us...  Let me know what yall think.  Let me know if I left anything out.  I will write the story about why Primus decided to make changes to the body composition another time, as well as a fiction flavor text to tell how we mere mortals came to understand the intricacies of the Modron physiology when Primus decided it was no longer prudent to keep their make-up a secret - allowing a simple scribe working at a Temple of Law and Goodness in the chaos of Limbo to come and see his works after a full dissection of a destroyed Duodrone and a full essay on their composition was written...  Primus learned things from its death by Tenebrous and other calamities, and has decided that some of its former orders and no longer pertinent to the state of the cosmos and the Modrons' activities.  <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/wink.png" title="Eye-wink" alt="Eye-wink" class="smiley-content"/>  Yeah, I have been having fun drawing and coming up with little stories in my head about why they did what they did....  And oh yeah, I even have an idea for why the original Modrons looked so goofy and awkward...

         <p>A site that has helped inspire me to fill in the blanks of the ecology of Mechanus is <a href="http://www.mimir.net/mechanus/index.shtml" class="bb-url">Here</a>.  Along with the information put forward, I would like to expand on the ideas behind mechanoids and the other facets of technology put in place within a Mechanus ecosystem.</p>

<p>Inevitables and Warforged have been outlined in full in other resources, however Aphanacts, Coggles, and Moignos have not been fully outlined with material about their physiology and behavior.  Along with those, I have two new types of Living Constructs - one is an Outsider, and both have the Extraplanar subtype (being from Mechanus).</p>

<p>When it comes to deities and cleric domains, the following domains will be composed in time: Technology, Energy, and Siege.  Technology will be similar to Mentalism / Magic, Energy will be similar to other elemental domains, and Siege will be most similar to War with an emphasis on siege engines and constructions of battle.</p>

<p>In addition to Primus (who will receive a full set of stats being reviewed here), other deities of technology will be created and put in place as well.  New deities include Technos, Aepos, Matrice, Aphan, Aignos, and Cog / Creche / Cain (a trinity being).</p>

<p>As you can see, I don't have all the stats written up for Primus, but I started with this, and will compose the rest as time goes on.  I need to choose Salient Divine Abilities for him which would be applicable, and of course fill in the stats for his Hit Dice build.</p>

<p>For Primus, I have currently written as follows:<br />
<div class="spoiler"><div class="spoiler-warning"><span>Spoiler:</span> Highlight to view</div><div class="spoiler-content"><br />
<span style="font-style:italic">(Short deity stat block)</span><br />
<span style="font-weight:bold"><span style="font-size:24px">Primus</span></span><br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Lesser Deity (Lawful Neutral)</span><br />
This lesser deity is ruler of the modrons and central to their society within Regulus on the plane of Mechanus.  Outside of modron society, no known worshippers are known to exist.<br />
His symbol is seven interlocking cogs; six smaller ones and one large one with a single blue &amp; gold hand with one blue eye in the middle of the palm; there is often a shining star surrounding the eye or hand.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Portfolio</span>: Technology, Modrons, Mechanus<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Domains</span>: Law, Mechanus, Protection, Technology, War (Siege)<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Cleric Training</span>: Modron clerics undergo no training, and are not required to act any differently than any other modron being.  Other creatures worshipping Primus are practically unheard of, and there is no formal clergy foundation from which to receive training.  It is unknown if Primus accepts other creatures into his clergy by visiting Regulus and asking Primus Himself.  Outsiders are rarely – if ever – given passage to the inner Energy Pool of Regulus in order to petition him for membership to clergy or modron society.  Because the number of modrons is static, it is thought impossible to become one.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Quests</span>: Modrons are given tasks and missions related to the perfection and maintenance of Regulus, and are required to follow orders of superior modron castes – other missions in the name of Primus are unknown.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Prayers</span>: Primus does not require prayer, as it is considered an illogical action and necessary only for receiving domain spells during a typical daily session of prayer or meditation.  Sessions of daily prayer are known as ‘synchronizations’ and consist only of the transmission of divine spells from the Prime to the modrons.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Temples</span>: Regulus is a huge towering piece of architecture on one of the large cogs within Mechanus which serves as the realm and stronghold of Primus, the modron Energy Pool, and the modrons.  It serves as the only well known temple to Primus, though some smaller buildings may exist on the Prime Material Plane or elsewhere in the cosmos, most possibly in locations where modrons reside or are known to explore.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Rites</span>: The only truly well-known ritual of worshippers of Primus is the veneration of Regulus and the Prime Himself during the initial phase of the changes that occur between the death of one Primus and the ascension of another Secundus caste modron to his place and a renewal of the Cycle of the Primes.  There is thought to be some amount of ritual involved if and when a mortal asks to join modron society and Primus, when the creature is asked to willingly enter the crèche forges within Regulus and join into the essence of the Modron Prime within the Energy Pool.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Herald and Allies</span>: Primus Himself exists as a physical being within Regulus on the outer plane of Mechanus with many possible alternate forms, and never sends an avatar to the Prime Material Plane worlds.  Instead, he sends a hierarch modron as his herald to all places and individuals with which he must communicate.  Any modron is considered an ally and passive missionary of Primus and his Order.</p>

         <p>I would like to make two adventure suggestions.  Kind of feeling around here as I am not sure if this is the perfect venue but it seems pretty good.  With all the recent post on Modrons what about something like Borg from Star Trek.  </p>

<p>Modrons start disappearing a faster than normal rate.  To that end a hostile faction of Assimilator Droids.  These "Assimilator Droids" are agents of Technos</p>

<p>Of course at some point the Warforged are going turn against their creators.  This could come about by releasing a mechanical virus into Mechanus.  When this is investigated it is found that the virus came from their own midst.  A false Tertian who swears loyalty to Technos</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>You are doing great by pulling in another divinity that I have covered in this material, but in fact Technos and his followers are plagued by yet one other unstated faction that I have yet to speak of - a non-deific being known simply as Goth.  This being assimilates everything in its reach and does so with devastating efficiency and accuracy.  It was brought into our cosmology from a parallel material plane where it had destroyed everything and everyone in it known to any scholar, and its growth and spreading influence from the far reaches near the Far Realm has been continuing for some time now.  Its current activities include stealing dying elements from the "outer rim" variant Limbo in order to fuel and produce more resources for its expansion.  This is the first time that Goth has moved into a planar cosmological setup instead of a simple material plane, so there is some time left for action...  But not much.  It is very much accustomed to space travel, however, so interplanar travel and moving through the void will not be much of a problem.</p>

<p>You may blame Imorphixius the Aberrant Chain Devil for that one.  <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/tongue.png" title="Sticking out tongue" alt="Sticking out tongue" class="smiley-content"/>  <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/wink.png" title="Eye-wink" alt="Eye-wink" class="smiley-content"/>  Chaotic Neutral is such a wonderful villain to play....  Especially when he is trying to piss off another villain and then brings an even more powerful villain into existence.  <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/tongue.png" title="Sticking out tongue" alt="Sticking out tongue" class="smiley-content"/></p>

<p>Technos, although uninterested in humanoids, animals, their worlds, or their general wellbeing, is certainly afraid of Goth's presence and continuing reach into the realms - and this is the primary reason behind his faltering affiliation with Primus, who he otherwise considers a nuisance and an immortal flesh being who can never be as powerful or perfect as a truly mechanoid being such as himself.  Though the Paraii are not mechanoid beings, they are also assimilators in some sense - but that could be another group which might put their own intentions on hold to bolster up against the oncoming threat.</p>

<p>Goth is a not a divine entity, but he has been able to replicate the processes behind magic both arcane and divine - so it is surely no real length of time before he happens upon the Cabala Inata - they ways of ascension and inception into divinity.</p>

<p>I also personally agree that this site and its members should consider putting together some new adventures, including the tech idea and a more fundamentally chaotic idea based on Pazuzu (and his attempt to climb back into grace - and his background unfurled into truth), the Queen of Chaos, and the Obyriths attempt to rise back to power in the Abyss.</p>

<ul class="bb-list" style="list-style-type:circle;"><li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obyrith">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obyrith</a></li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_of_Chaos">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_of_Chaos</a></li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pazuzu_%28Dungeons_%26_Dragons%29">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pazuzu_%28Dungeons_%26_Dragons%29</a></li></ul>

<p>I don't have Fiendish Codices, so I am out on that one for some of the technical aspects of it, but I have a LOT of ideas happening involving Pazuzu and his attempt to reclaim his goodness - once lost to his fall from grace (Challenge of Holy Divergence, from Seraphim - Pazuzu's true outsider type - NOT obyrith - all lies!!).</p>

<p>I like that someone else sees the adventure seeds for what they are...  <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/wink.png" title="Eye-wink" alt="Eye-wink" class="smiley-content"/>  I think 2010 should be a year in which Planewalker.com shows itself a truly productive community to a 'legacy' campaign that is surely not in any way dead or dying any time soon.  My personal preference would be that we all take it one step further and implement rules for variant cosmologies, parallel/paradigm/paradox worlds and cosmologies, and an understanding of what happened to the Planescape cosmology to bring about the horrendous 4e cosmology...  All big questions and concerns which only this community has all the resources to answer adequately and with much rationalization.</p>

<p>I did a written stat block for Seraphim - and have updated it in full (finally) here: <a href="http://www.enworld.org/forum/homebrews/264367-dinopriminals-phantasy-prehistorium-nym-omarka-3.html#post4968638" title="http://www.enworld.org/forum/homebrews/264367-dinopriminals-phantasy-prehistorium-nym-omarka-3.html#post4968638">http://www.enworld.org/forum/homebrews/264367-dinopriminals-phantasy-pre...</a></p>

<p>I did not add Creatures as Characters yet, and the Racial Traits &amp; Options is a little unorganized at the moment, plus I will be able to put some of that info down in the Variants section at some point.  In any case, yeah - Pazuzu is one of these, and his Challenge of Holy Divergence did him in a long time ago, causing him to fall from grace...  And in his case - permanently....  At least for now.  Pazuzu has been re-examining his thoughts, actions, 'karma', and the state of existence in the planes, and has lately been using his status and power among the demons to cause changes which would put him in a position to potentially gain his angelic status back, and cause a great amount of goodness in the Prime worlds of Nym and Pyrroth, whose protection by Divine Sigils is currently at stake.</p>

<p>The storyteller could use this as an opportunity to really bring Pazuzu 'back into the light', or else it could be just another scheme where he uses his influence to gain control and then bring hellish consequences on a situation where he has the upperhand.  Anyone who enjoys putting Pazuzu into play as a demon will likely take the latter choice, while other storytellers might enjoy the idea of Pazuzu earning back his ascendancy into the angelic hosts of the very ancient Seraphim culture.  In any case, the storyline would reveal that never at any time was Pazuzu actually an Obyrith, which would explain why he is so different from the rest of them.  His seraphim background allows him to have a much more diverse and intriguing history, especially when you consider his relationship with the Queen of Chaos and its implications in their dealings, their past, and how her current actions might be implemented into a larger storyline (ie, the 'Seeds of Chaos') where the Obyriths try to gain their power back from the demons of the Abyss.</p>

<p>More will come on the technology stuff, but some of the information about the deities and their influence I have to keep a little secret so I can put together a potentially for-profit supplemental sourcebook for 3.5/Pathfinder RPG.  I am saying a no-go to 4e D&amp;D - I am not impressed with the company's actions or ideals.</p>

<p>Modrons will come first, because all of that is copyrighted material, and I will not be able to publish it...  So I will instead post it here and on ENWorld, and make references to it in my own works on tech and mechanoids.  Planewalker gets it, because this site is the bomb, and the community is going somewhere instead of simply stagnating, as I believe Wizards thinks that their campaign setting intellectual property and potential profits from such have been doing in recent years/decades.  I personally feel that they are wrong, and wish to be a part of the solution to this overlooked market niche's primary challenges.  Modrons and Primus are where I begin.  I have the Quadrone done - but want to get the Pentadrone finished first before I scan and upload them and post their physical composition written descriptions.  Then, onto the Hierarchs.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Quadrone was scanned and added to this page (using the site's media host folders), and I updated my work on Primus.  The PDF file is the most detailed draft yet.

         <p>So no one even has something to say about the favored weapon I chose for him either...?  I was originally thinking quarterstaff for favored weapon, but I was considering the infinity web strands (filaments) and the fact that he might view the unarmed attack as the one most orderly - the one you hold on as your self.

         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>disorder_cleric</em> wrote:</div>Wow great job!  You put a lot of work into that.  I am interested in Cybertron?  Very cool stuff.  I like the Aspect of Primus.  I also like the backstory.</div></p>

<p>Thank you (god, I needed input - even if it was a simple, "I read, and it's good").  <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/wink.png" title="Eye-wink" alt="Eye-wink" class="smiley-content"/>  And to be honest, the ONLY reason I put that Cybertron part in there was because in my searching for images of Primus, I realized that the creator-god-being of the Transformers was also called Primus....  And I thought that might be an interesting variation on the future destiny of Primus and his dealings.  I see him as being one of the few beings that might just survive through until the next formation of the cosmos - or at least long enough to outlast the concerns of the current Planescape plots that might cause havoc to the degree of putting a deity in danger of destruction....</p>

<p>It's still not done, obviously - but I wanted to get up what I had completed to see how near or far to other people's ideas of him I had been going.  I am especially concerned with the Favored Weapon at this point - I don't know what to put in that part...  I often think that the favored weapons of most deities are too generic or not very thoughtful or unique - and I don't want that here with Primus.  Any thoughts on that?</p>

<p>Maybe I will have to find some images of the Transformers Primus to show you what I mean...  I remember the original cartoon and comics of Transformers, but I don't remember this version of Primus - although I found it incredibly interesting to note the similarities in form, function, methodology, and potential goals.  Pretty neat coincidence, if you ask me, and it definitely brings up certain questions about the integrity and delineation of certain intellectual property concerns of mine regarding the name, persona, historical aspects, and connections/separation between the two....  I think of this version of Primus as being a future rendition of him as he makes his way into the influence of the Material Plane's Paraprime reality and its destined course of events (since technically everything in my game can somehow be brought over into the modern-day reality or else a paradigm/paradox reality of the same)....  I just always think about those things while I am creating my fantasy work...  What would happen if it came over to this side of the line between reality and fiction?  <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/wink.png" title="Eye-wink" alt="Eye-wink" class="smiley-content"/></p>

<p>I really need some more input.  I appreciate what you've said already, but I need a little more to bounce off of before moving on...  Maybe even some input or thoughts of what was going through your own head as you were reading...  God knows, I would accept anyone's advice at this point...  I want it to be good, realistic, and creative all at once.<br />

         <p>A whip is a good choice.  Kind of make you think about keeping in line.  A flail.  A staff.  I am not sure it make too much difference.  So long as you can write around it.   It would be fairly unique.  </p>

<p>There seem to by a tie in with transformers.  That is what I was talking about before the stories change a bit but the themes are fairly constant.  Clock-like plane makes and controls clock-like creatures.   It is interesting that you chose chaotic realms and "demons" as part of Primus's foundation.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Yeah, I have to admit that the similarities between the mysterious Primus of D&amp;D and the mysterious Primus of Transformers are quite astounding - and I think it fits perfectly the idea that after this current (fantasy) reality in Paraprime, he would find ways to continue in realities removed from this Paraprime - and merge into our own known world in a future destiny of his.</p>

<ul class="bb-list" style="list-style-type:circle;"><li><a href="http://tfwiki.net/wiki/Primus">http://tfwiki.net/wiki/Primus</a></li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primus_%28Transformers%29">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primus_%28Transformers%29</a></li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primus">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primus</a></li></ul>

<p>Demons?  Did I mention that?  The only thing I remember about demons was the War of Chaos vs. Law, which is more of a setting element described in Planescape and predating the Blood War more than a personal history to Primus himself.  It was a coalition of Eladrin and Demons which originally destroyed the Aphanacts - the angel-like beings of lawful neutrality predating the Inevitables.</p>

<p>However, since the basic nature of most Titans is that of chaos and independence, I thought that was a good juxtaposition to Primus' lawful nature.  If it were not for certain factors, he may have even ended up being Lawful Good...  But then his most prized possession, Cubey (Quark) went off into the multiverse to explore it for himself, and was subsequently destroyed and his carcass turned into a giant moving fortress for a Titan lich-king Sorcerer.  That did Primus in emotionally, and from then on in he no longer cared for the ideas of good and evil at all.  He is essentially an uncaring force of law and order from now on - the lives of mortals and immortals are of no concern to him, but are only important for the continuing order of the multiverse alone.  His goodness does escape every so often, but only during periods of memory looking back on his past incarnations - which is not something that many have ever been able to witness outside of the scribe in my writing.</p>

<p>I appreciate the input - I needed it badly.  <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/wink.png" title="Eye-wink" alt="Eye-wink" class="smiley-content"/><br />

         <p>Aphanacts are only mentioned quickly in the Ecology of the Inevitables, and Ripvanwormer said that there may have been another mention somewhere....  And that is why I am making stats for them.  I am big into making sure that overlooked content is no longer overlooked.  <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/wink.png" title="Eye-wink" alt="Eye-wink" class="smiley-content"/></p>

<p>The Law v. Chaos war was waged before the Blood War - I know that.  At one point, the Aphanacts rose up against all chaotic beings, and a coalition of chaotic good and chaotic evil outsiders fought against them and destroyed them....  Apparently.  <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/tongue.png" title="Sticking out tongue" alt="Sticking out tongue" class="smiley-content"/>  In reality, I know exactly what happened to them....  And though they may have disappeared from sight, they did not disappear from reality.

         <p>New image - depicting symbol of Primus and the beginning (Cog only) of the trinity being, Cog / Creche / Cain.  Done in vector graphics...  Saved a little too big as an image, but it's good for detail.</p>

<p>Really the only important part here on this one specifically is Primus' symbol - give me comments and thoughts on that one, and let the other one be for a minute until I get the other two elements brought in (Creche and Cain).</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>My goal in this project (as the project post-production of phase I for this material) is to compile and revise a whole ton of stuff on technology in fantasy games, and to give adequate nods to excellent work on mechanical-oriented work from the past - hence, the Planescape Clockwork Nirvana of Mechanus must have the material out of my head on Primus and his modrons...  Then, when I put together my whole booklet on technology and mechanoids, we will have a whole new way to view living constructs, industrial innovation, and mechanica into fantasy games without altering everything we have ever known about a good magical fantasy game.  At some point, if I can obtain the license to use the Primus character, material, and concept in order to give a full nod back to this setting, I will incorporate a nice bit of this into it, given Wizards of the Coast providing permissions/licensing.</p>

<p>I will likely nod to my own work with the other deities here, but my goal is to publish everything non-Modron using resources available to me, but will likely not give the whole story on that stuff.  I will give enough hooks here to get people interested and share the link to a published text once finalized.  I am sure people might die to have a compiled book of information about these things, to be honest.</p>

<p>I also think that the planes should somehow ALL be in danger, or at least to such a point as to explain why new cosmologies are being discovered and/or why it is possible to travel to planes where the outer planes or general schema is not the same as in this Planescape setting.  It's time for the Planescape fan community to go homebrew and conjure up some real dedicated to work on planar traits that are universal in nature, in much the same way as 'Manual of the Planes' did when 3rd edition was just in its beginning phases.  With 4e being in a completely different planar setup, I think it deserves the attention of the experts, and no greater crew exists than right here.  Not to mention, I have my third-party book 'Portals &amp; Planes' by Fantasy Flight's Legends &amp; Lairs product line for variant stuff...  And it's amazingly well-written material to make you think beyond the Great Wheel when considering how many crazy things a deity might pull in his/her/its life with the possibility of going to multiple (para)primes, and alternative cosmological schema.  Simply the concept of traveling through time presents certain challenges to game statistics and plotline formation, which means that such correlations between planes as the rate of time at which they move is an important aspect and should be addressed by the only community capable of properly handling such a task....  Us.  <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/wink.png" title="Eye-wink" alt="Eye-wink" class="smiley-content"/><br />
