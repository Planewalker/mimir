         <p>Githzerai rarely venture into the Ethereal, and keeping slaves is possibly the greatest crime in their society. Perhaps you are thinking of Githyanki? Although Ethergaunts would make the most sense. </p>

<p>As far as being a Tiefling is concerned, I'm curious as to how your Nathri became one in the first place. Fiends rarely enter the Inner Planes, and the Ethereal is an even odder choice. I'm not sure the Baatezu Tenar'ri would spend must time away from their precious Blood War on purpose, and the Yugoloths wouldn't go out there without a good reason.  Also, Tieflings are never more than a quarter fiendish. Anything more is called a Half-fiend (or Cambion or Alu-fiend if you like being overly complicated) as I told another player, it's spelled "Tiefling" not "Thiefling." It's roughly two-and-a-half syllables, and is pronounced "TEE-ef-ling", although "TEEF-ling" is also fine as the resulting sounds are nearly identical.</p>

<p>As for languages, you automatically know Nathri and Planar Trade. Ethergaunts don't have their own spoken language (they rely on telepathy), but you should probably have been exposed to several Prime languages, and certainly all the Elemental languages (Auran, Aquan, Terran, and Ignan), as well as a few odd-ball languages spoken on the demiplanes. Also, Nathri can aquire Draconic as a bonus language for some reason. Also, since you're a Tiefling, I'll let you get Abyssal, Infernal, or Fiendish as bonus language (whichever one your ancester spoke).</p>

<p>Catstink, Flash Pellets, and the Longspoon all seem fine.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Ok, hello everyone, and HAPPY HALLOWEEN! (I hope you were all good and got lots of candy!)</p>

<p>I nearly lost my entire character background, but was able to restore the nearly lost data (for which I am very grateful) -thus, Linji's history really will be posted up tonight.</p>

<p>Duckluck, </p>

<p>Kudos on answering all the questions so ably (it is so nice to have a "good man at the helm").  </p>

<p>-and yes, your explanation on Solars, cant, etc was ellucidating.  (and, yes, my false example was intentionally erroneous).  </p>

<p>-and, whew! Githzerai slavers, I think Linji's heart may have just stopped!  It is funny though because in Linji's background proposal, he has spent some time on the ethereal (more on that later), though definately not to raid Nathri or engage in slavery.<br />
(thus, according to the wills of out beloved DM and JOR, I will give a proposal to intertwine a potential tie-in with M'rek and Linji -but feel free to disregard if necessary).  </p>

<p>-also, Duckluck, you alluded to the fact that once we "begin" that purchasing might not be possible due to circumstance/timing.  That said, if you allow Linji and Kadar to know each other, woul you allow Linji buying (with his starting gp) Kadar a MW cold iron dao?</p>

<p>-along that lines, thanks to Azriael and JaggedOldRed for the wands -hurrah!</p>

<p>JaggedOldRed,<br />
 <br />
-as for the last spell, here are some suggestions:</p>

<p>You want something that will be useful now, and useful throughout your entire PC life, and thus, things that have saves will eventually become ineffectual (or things like mage armor being ineffective since you possess armor already), thus...</p>

<p>1. Protection from Good/Evil/Law/Chaos: This is a great spell, as it always is usuable since it prohibits endowed character from being affected by charm and domination, etc.  Also, the chance of hedging outsiders is great (at low levels due to the DC) especially in a planar campaign.  The +2 AC/saves is also always great, but you'd have to pick which alignment you might have the most conflict with (not an easy thing considering the campaign premise).  Lastly, the duration is measured in minutes, and thus has pretty good bang for buck.</p>

<p>2. True strike -what more do I need to say?  +20 insight bonus is great, especially for assassin types trying to get the death attack -this is made even better since it negates concealment miss chance (which works well with the whole Nathri/Ethereal connection).  This would probably be my first pick.</p>

<p>3. Feather Fall -its not as nice as the other two, but it is a spell that can be cast off the fly, and can save yourself from falling damage (whether used defensively, or offensively -pulling off the classic cat burgalar/assassin that jumps out windows and floats to safety, preventing being tailed).</p>

<p>Those are my shorthand picks.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>You can buy Tokens of Featherfall (I think they're in the SRD somewhere) for cheap, so save your spell slots for things that will come up a lot. Protection from X and True Strike are both great ideas though. I'd offer other suggestions, but I don't care enough. Hehe.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

I'll have to take a banana from you (or however that works).<br />
Lots of healing for you!<br />
btw I'm updating my history/profile as I go along in the original post. Nothing major, just detailing dislikes and relationships to the Touts guild at the moment. I'll probably post it again once I've made the finishing touches. I'm also thinking the sandstone district of clerks ward could work as my kip- close to the hive, quiet neighbours, not too far to jog to the Gymnasium.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Ok. First of all, of course Githyanki, NOT Gitzerai!!  </p>

<p>Now, here is a possible background story for M’rek. I say possible because in it I atempt to flesh out more the beliefs and culture of the Nathri, and this might not be accepted by Duck…also I will offer an “alternative” method for M’rek tieflingness…please bear with me a little, and have in mind that the Nathri (or at least my clan)  are really very isolated…here is a first instalment, I really welcome feedback, specially from our esteemed DM!</p>

<p>Here are some premises for  the Nathri:<br />
First, nobody really knows exactly where Nathri go when they die. The fact that only very few are encountered anywhere but in the ethereal plane seems to corroborate what their own traditions and myths have to say about their race.</p>

<p>What the Nathri believe is that their race has been condemned to roam the the ether for some transgression in the distant past, what that was, nobody knows exactly, although every Nathri clan  has their own interpretation of what was that transgression was and what has to be done to attone for it. It is one of the few things responsible for the occasional inter-clan attriction. The Nathri being otherwise too preocupied with survival to have time for inter-species warfare…</p>

<p>Also the Nathri believe that most of those who die in the ethereal will remain in the ethereal as spirits and come back to keep serving and guiding the clan. It is for this reason that most Nathri divine spellcasters are Spirit Shamans (complete divine) able to converse freely with their ancestors. There are no Nathri gods. At least no gods known to the Nathri that roam the ethereal. This after-life service is considered to be a great honor, and with time a spirit with strong connections to its clan will reincarnate into a new Nathri. Although the cicle of spirit service and  rebirth is considered honorable and in fact crucial to a clan~s survival, it is not considered as an ideal state of things. For starters, due to the great wars and massacres that have driven the Nathri deep into the ethereal, the number of new births does not accommodate the reincarnation needs of all Nathri. Also, this cycle is seen as just an interim solution, until the Nathri can figure out where is “their place in the universe”.  To this effect, some Nathri are routinelly sent into “exploratory” missions into the outer planes, in the hopes of either finding their long lost homeland, or at least a new place where the Nathri could fit outside the ethereal… Some of these Nathri that leave the deep ethereal eventually find a home in th eafterlife in one of the planes, but so far the race as a whole remains lost. Also, and most importantly, because many clan shamans believe that the deed of atonement for the race cannot be accomplished IN the ethereal alone, but will be connected to some deep crysis in the multiverse, so they send scouts/ambassadors to try and keep abreast of such events…to everyone’s surprise those savage seers seem to have an uncanny knack for snifing trouble elsewhere in the multiverse (they claim thet the ethereal echos the moans of the multiverse), and in many places/planes, the arrival of a lone Nathri is considered a very bad omen…</p>

<p>(this idea of an entire race looking for an “outer plane to call home” seems very interesting to me and could lead to nice adventure motivations for M’rek. I am trying to portray the Nathri as the really true outsiders of the multiverse, even more clueless in many ways than primes. They are a lost race, dwindlin in the desert, much like the bushmen of the Kalahari desert in Namibia (anyone seen the gods must be mad?, or any of a number of discovery programs on them?)</p>

          Linji&#039;s background        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Ok, here is Linji's background (submitted for approval):</p>

<p>"'It's very good tea,' Linji says.<br />
'Well, I don't want any Today, at any rate,' said Rinzai.<br />
'You couldn't have it if you DID want it,' Linji says. 'The rule is, tea tomorrow and tea yesterday--but never tea today.'<br />
'It MUST come sometimes to "tea today,"' Rinzai objected.<br />
'No, it can't,' says Linji. 'It's tea every OTHER day: today isn't any OTHER day, you know.'<br />
'I don't understand you,' said Rinzai. 'It's dreadfully confusing!'<br />
'That's the effect of living backwards,' Linji says kindly: 'it always makes one a little giddy at first--'<br />
'Living backwards!' Rinzai repeated in great astonishment. 'I've never heard of such a thing!'<br />
'--but there's one great advantage in it, that one's memory works both ways.'<br />
'I'm sure MINE only works one way,' Rinzai remarked. 'I can't remember things before they happen.'<br />
'It's a poor sort of memory that only works backwards,' Linji says."</p>

<p>"Torpellin asks, 'What happened in the past?'<br />
Wu answers, 'Past has not happened  -it is happening, as is Present, and Future, and will always be happening, and thus will never have happened.'"</p>

<p>The Round Edge of the Square, excerpts of the Unformed Circle of Linji </p>

<p>Like most Githzerai, Linji was born in Limbo in one of the great floating cities of the People.  However, he was not born Shra'kt'lor, or within Toroj, but in a lesser-known city of the People: Err'ishtok.<br />
At the time of Linji's birth, Err'ishtok had over 500,000 Githzerai as residents, though even this large number is only a fourth of the size of the fabled Shra'kt'lor, city of the mythical God-King.  As are the other great cities of the People, Err'ishtok was formed and maintained by the collective will of its resident Anarchs.  Like the other cities, Err'ishtok is surrounded by a bubble of air, protecting it from the entropic soup of Limbo.  Inside the bubble, floating serenely in the air is a megalithic pyramid of mute black stone, here and there offset by stone work in shades of gray and white (Linji claims their pattern is a secret code for making great tea!).  Closer scrutiny reveals that all four sides of the pyramid are terraced and have communal plots of gardens and fields; inside the structure were multitudes of tunnels and the living spaces of the citizens.  <br />
Also formed by the Anarchs was what the People of Err'ishtok called the Sphere: an immense ball of fire that hovers a fair distance from the city.  The Anarchs could move the fiery orb around, but usually kept it fixed in place, slowly diminishing or increasing its intensity to simulate a kind of "night" and "day."  Though most of the githzerai homes within the city would not even see this light, it also seemed evident that the Sphere may have been used more for the K'insai's benefit, Prime races accustomed to living in patterns based on the presence or the absence of the Prime-world sun. <br />
Attached to the "city-proper" was The Chain, a mile long group of various sized slabs of stone that were joined by suspension bridges.  The Chain (alluding to the Unbroken Chain of Zerthimon) formed a pathway between the city itself and the Hall of K'insai.  As such the Chain was not only used for travel, but also for training of mind and body, as the Chain was always in movement, constantly caught in some unseen current, causing the stones to rise and shift.<br />
At the end of the Chain was the Hall of the K'insai (although in the language of the Gith, it was called Alsa'K'insai, a small island of rock, upon which a monastery stood, surrounded by woods and rivers that flowed off into the void.  The Hall, which was shaped like a gem of smoke-gray crystalline stone, was once a monastery of the Githzerai, but had been abandoned by the People until they reopened its doors to outsiders, not of the People, but those who wished to *know* their ways.  Only Githzerai were allowed within Err'ishtok, and even then, contact between the Hall's inhabitants and the People was extremely limited -only a handful had regular contact with the K'insai.<br />
Linji's mother and grandfather were two of these rare Gith.  Like all of the People, Linji was born in an egg in one of the communal nurseries to hatch and learned the Ways of the People at an early age.  He never knew his father for he died while on a Rrakkma while Linji was still an infant, and his early years he spent with his grandfather, Gor'Rolok, who was an austere Gith who spent his time raising and teaching the young Zerthlings to *know* themselves and the traditions of the People.  Only after two decades did he meet his mother, Rak'Evva, who was away on missions in the Astral and the Prime -unlike her deceased companion, she had never participated in a Rrakkma, but was a skilled psychic warrior who had spent decades fighting the Githyanki and acting as a spy and assassin for her People.  It was her last mission that caused her to return with a group of Prime children (their land had been destroyed by the Githyanki), and the cause of her working with the Hall of the K'insai, as did her father as well.  Linji was trained by his mother and grandfather alongside these juvenile Prime K'insai, and thus was exposed to cultures and races to a degree that was uncommon for the usually reserved Githzerai.  It was not long thereafter that, Linji (being much older than most of the K'insai) passed his Age of Accountability, the Githzerai rite of passage from being a Zerthling to being an adult.  It was also at this time, that Linji received his adult name by his grandfather -Rinzai. (being the name of one of his famous ancestors, as is the common custom of the People).<br />
Now an adult, Linji was no longer permitted to study with the K'insai, and even more so, his family grew concerned that his early exposure to non-gith and their cultures had made Linji "unfocused".  <br />
Linji had never been a bad Zerthling; instead, he readily learned the mantras of the People, showed remarkable aptitude in psionics and was respectful to his elders.  No, Linji merely liked to think and question -a lot.  His grandfather especially saw this as disturbing as he sought for Linji to "quiet" his mind.  Eventually, his Elders decided that in order to change the Inner, the Outer must change as well.  Thus, it was decided that Linji would travel to a distant monastery, and learn the ways of the monks of the People.  Due to his proclivities of the mind and his sharp intellect, he was accepted at the renowned monastery, Zerth'Ad'lun.  <br />
There Linji was trained in the teachings of Sensei Belthomais, an accomplished, powerful monk. Belthomais taught Linji, as well as all his students, a specialized martial art form (each monastery having different focus and style), while those students who fully embraced his teachings were called Zerth Cenobites.  These disciples seek to practice zerthi—"Zerth's teaching" in the githzerai tongue—claiming to peer a moment into the future in order to aid their martial expertise.<br />
Linji trained under Sensei Belthomais for many decades, and perhaps would have continued his studies for many more, had his affinity and skill at Chaos-shaping not been discovered.  As the Anarch Guild of Shra'kt'lor is wont to do, they test Githzerai, always searching among the young generations for those who have a latent talent for shaping.  Although Linji had rarely been in the "soup" of Limbo, his talents nevertheless held much potential, and he was soon identified by the Guild as a potential Anarch.<br />
Though still at Zerth'Ad'lun, Linji's focus became centered on chaos-shaping, priming for the Rthak'aai.  </p>

<p>The chaos-shapers of the People maintain many secretive traditions in the practice of their craft. One of the most ancient and important of their customs is the test of Rthak'aai, a formal demonstration of a student's skill and ability to survive in the wildness of deepest Limbo. Most githzerai live out their entire lives without being tested in Rthak'aai; even many chaos-shapers never undergo the challenges. But it remains, a way to determine which among the githzerai are truly able to master their adopted home, and a person who has passed its challenges is respected by all who live within Shra'tk'lor.  For Linji, passing the test of Rthak'aai would prove himself worthy to enter the Guild of Anarchs.  Time passed, and eventually Linji felt ready face the daunting challenge.<br />
As with each rthak'aai, Linji's test took place within a specially constructed island of stability within the depths of Limbo. As each rthak'aai island is unique and used only once, Linji's rthak'aai testing (like all such testing) required the participation of at least one master chaos-shaper, and a not inconsiderable investment of time and willpower. (Overseeing a student's rthak'aai is often as much a rite of passage for the master as the test itself is for the student).  Linji never knew who his master-shaper(s) was (were), for her/she (or they) were always concealed by the radiance of anarch-shaped lightning.<br />
As is the case with all such tests, the goal of Linji's rthak'aai was to find and claim a key item that was located within a maze of challenges and dangers, to had to be returned to the master shapers. This key item was only described in general terms (which prevented Linji from simply shaping his own copy of the key from raw chaos and making a quick escape).  As is the custom of his People, all of Linji's items were taken away (except for his Cenobite robes) -even his all psionic reservoirs were drained to nothing. <br />
Like all Rthak'aai, Linji faced six challenges as part of the test; they were:</p>

<p>The Test of Stamina - This is often the first test of rthak'aai, a straightforward obstacle to be overcome. The students are confronted with an impassable barrier of hazardous material, such as a wall of flame or tunnel filled with water or acid, and must ward themselves from the danger in order to pass. Shaping a space through the substance is allowed, but is more strenuous and less likely to succeed. </p>

<p>Perhaps the easiest of the tests for Linji, he simply drew upon his training as a monk, and was able to tumble down a shaft that was a maze of arching lightning (each arc springing from iron rods driven into the rock).  His keenly honed reflexes allowed him to land and avoid the peril unscathed, except for a sprained ankle.</p>

<p>The Test of Perception - Another early test, the Test of Perception offers students a tool or an important clue that will be vital later in the challenge - but disguised or hidden, so that a student must work to uncover it. Sometimes, the tool is a mass of raw matter, easily shaped into whatever form students might need - but at a casual glance nothing more than unremarkable earth or water. In another case, information in written or glamered form is provided, and then obscured so that a student must shape the obstruction away. In all cases, though, bypassing the assistance makes later tests difficult if not impossible to overcome. </p>

<p>Linji almost failed this portion of the test.  Upon reaching the bottom of the shaft (which was then sealed by the Anarch-master(s), Linji found himself in a cavern whose bottom reaches were filled with shimmering water, and a cavern filled with steam.  Nearly concealed in the mists was a tunnel leading down and away from the chamber.  Weary of the water, Linji was able to push away the steam-vapors, discovering a small path of stepping stones.  Linji was able to spring across the path, but slipped at the end, his injured ankle causing him to slip and his foot slipped into the waters.  Expecting some calamity to occur, Linji was shocked as the shimmering waters healed his minor injury.  Stopping to study the waters, Linji noticed that below the water's surface, something was churning the water.  Linji dived in to investigate, and soon found that the source of the steam and the churning of the warm waters was the bottom-most section of the bedrock was a whorl of chaos-shaped flame.  However, Linji could not then understand its importance; however, though his training, he was able to note that the waters had been infused with positive energy (holy water as K'insai called it).  Unsure of what this boded, Linji continued down the path.</p>

<p>Test of Wits - This test challenges students to use their chaos-shaping abilities in an innovative and unexpected way. The challenge is obvious, the solution is not - and be it by extruding nearby earth as a bridge over a trapped region, imposing traits of elemental air to blow away a choking fog, or shaping nearby matter into the form of a shield or other barrier, the safest way past will never be an obvious one. It's not uncommon for a rthak'aai creator to set up a Test of Wits with one form of solution in mind - and then for a student to find a different but equally innovative way past the challenge. </p>

<p>Once Linji left the cavern with the steaming waters, he found himself in a maze that seemed to spiral downwards.  The labyrinth was especially devious since all of its paths were round tunnels, and all (due to their subjective gravity) were made of thick sand, making progress slow.  Frustrated, Linji sought to shape a wind to blow away the sand, but soon found out that the entire walls were made of sand, and he fell, nearly being buried alive as the walls around him collapsed in a blinding spray (Luckily, the fall did creak his concentration and the wind stopped before the damage to the labyrinth was too extensive).  Pondering his situation, Linji tired another tactic.  Flash-searing the sandy walls, he shaped them all into glass.  Though slippery, Linji was able to now see the correct path (and quickened his progress by smashing through several of the glass walls).  </p>

<p>Test of Mettle - Possibly the most dangerous of all the tests, this challenge pits students against another living creature, hostile and determined to cripple or kill the student. Lesser slaadi are the most common creatures to appear in this situation, but any sort of dangerous creature native to Limbo may appear. Students may use any method that works to pass the opponent, be it combat, evasion, intimidation or trickery, but should be sure that the chosen method will work. The danger in this test is very real. </p>

<p>In more ways than one, this was perhaps the pivotal experience that changed Linji's existence.  <br />
As Linji exited the now-glass labyrinth, he found himself in a chamber of flesh-like substance, an amalgam of organic tissue, with areas secreting acidic pools.  Treading carefully though the rippling chamber, he soon discovered he was not alone in the strange womb-like chamber.  <br />
Rippling from the fleshy surface, as if being birthed, a Blue Slaad emerged, reaching for Linji with its massive hooked hands.  Reactively purely from instinct, Linji dodged the Exemplar of Chaos.  <br />
Smiling his its shark-like teeth, the pale blue Slaad stared as if looking into Linji's very soul (or appraising a future meal).  Linji attempted to shape a wave of acid to engulf the Slaad, but its power of shaping was too strong.  In response, the Slaad summoned up waves of chaotic energy, which flowed off its shimmering skin, till exploding into a cacophony of ephemeral essence.  Linji tried to avoid its touch, but its fractious energy seemed drawn to his very spirit.  Its touch caused agony of body, as Linji felt his organs churn, trying to displace themselves.  Perhaps even worse, was its effect upon the mind -to Linji's monastic spirit, it felt as if he was just submerged in ice-cold water -its effect slowing and numbing his thoughts and actions (and, yet, in a way, it seemed to awaken his mind as well, as if startling from a great sleep).<br />
Struggling to fight the magic's effect, as well as seeking scanning his environment for some method of escape, Linji noticed red and orange tattoos that spiraled across the Slaad's skin, which became more scaled and fish like on its lower half.  Linji's jumbled observations were then started for the Slaad began to speak; as many of the People do, Linji had studied the Slaadi tongue.  However, this was the first time he had ever heard it spoken by a Slaad.<br />
Though Linji's mind was hazed by the Slaad's magic and he is unsure if more was said, he recalls clearly its first and last words:</p>

<p>"iN yEncuIlIa in YenCUiya, in XayAcaTl In yOlLotl... In xoChiTl iN cUiCatL in TEotL iCuac ihiYOtl, IN atoNahui in eiEhuiA."</p>

<p>Struggling not only with the multi-nuanced language of the Slaadi, but also the distorting magic, Linji roughly understood its words, "To make new and to become anew, the face and the heart are one, but not...  the blossoming flower as the unsinging song while the essence of spirit is becoming, the fever desires, as the desires of the fever."  Confused, and more than a little afraid, Linji attempted to answer, sensing the Slaad had asked a question.  Linji's replied, struggling now with the Slaadi tongue, "Ayamo." (which is roughly no in the Slaadi tongue, but more appropriately rendered as "not yet" as there are no absolutes in the Slaadi language).<br />
The immense Blue Slaad then bowed its frog-like head, showing some seal imbedded in its forehead, as if granting permission to leave.  Not stopping to stare further or wait to better understand its gesture, Linji ran to the exit he had been searching for.  However, before he could get there, the Blue Slaad bellowed one word -"AxiTIa! (which roughly translated, means "to come closer").  No sooner had the words been spoken did powerful magic grab hold of Linji, lifting him into the air and sent him hurtling into the "ceiling" of the chamber, which was covered in caustic enzymic slime.  His skin burning from its contact, Linji quickly somersaulted up, to find the Blue Slaadi jumping down (up)? to loom over him, cutting off his escape.  Trapped and injured, Linji attacked the Slaadi, releasing a flurry of blows upon its thick swirling hide.  One of the blows landed, the others missed.  The Blue responded by grabbing hold of Linji with its massive clawed hands, and then opened its mouth wide.  Inside its maw, Linji could see gathering currents of strange bile and blood that seemed to whisper his name. Any such thoughts were quickly washed away as the Slaad bite down on Linji's stomach, the dagger-like teeth rending flesh and robe, and more insidious was the strange fluid that drained, washed into his body.  Writhing free of the terrible grip, Linji stumbled to escape, and made it a few paces below a powerful backhand from the Slaad smashed into the back of his head.  As consciousness faded, Linji heard the now soft spoken voice of the Blue, "cochitlehua" (which according to Linji's understanding means "to sleep the dream" but also "to dream the sleep").  <br />
And indeed Linji did dream, and sleep.  For how long he slept, he does not know, and nor can he recall his dreams of chaos, for they all were fleeting, phantasms of possibility, an awakening of long-slumbering secrets inside his spirit and heart.  He felt pain, yes, but such was not unfamiliar to him -he was Githzerai, and to the People, to *know* oneself is to suffer.  <br />
Unsure of whether he at last had conquered the dreams, or if the dreams had conquered the last of him, Linji awoke to find himself still in the organic womb-like chamber.  As he painfully opened his eyes, he saw the Slaad sitting across from him -he also noticed a strange creature flittering about the Slaad -it was translucent, and seemed slimly as it seemed to swim through the musky air.  It resembled something like a bizarre giant tadpole with arms, its frog-like face was licking the air and it soon became apparent that its eyes were closed, like the young of many prime creatures are after being born.  It seemed to regard Linji, and at that moment, Linji felt a terrible pain in his stomach.  Reaching down, Linji was shocked and startled to see his hands and skin had changed. His limbs seemed to bend oddly, and his fingernails were gone.  Even stranger was his skin, which swirled as if it were covered in living paint.  Examining himself, he found other equally bizarre changes -Rinzai the Githzerai was no more -Linji the Chaond-Githzerai was-is now.<br />
Utterly confounded, Linji attempted to rise, a million questions running though his mind, but all were stopped short, as his legs buckled underneath of him.  It was only then that Linji realized how famished he was. <br />
Previous to this the Blue had just patiently watched, but upon seeing Linji's failed attempt to rise, he tore off a piece of the organic "floor", still covered with caustic slime, and offered it to Linji, saying:</p>

<p>"mOcoChcAYotIa.  In MoCOchCayOtiA in toMahUac."</p>

<p>Understanding came more quickly, as Linji, almost reflexively understood, "Eat.  In eating, grow fat." It seemed almost a parody of the Githzerai proverb, "Endure.  In enduring, grow strong."  And, yet, Linji sensed a greater truth in the Slaad's words.  Regardless, it was an immediate truth, and Linji accepted the strange offering of food.  And while Linji among the Githzerai had never eaten much meat, the bizarre fleshy substance was quickly devoured, and even more strange was the realization that the acidic slime that once burned his skin was now as refreshing as water.  <br />
Time passed, and Linji grew strong again, his wounds healing as he feasted and drank from the organic chamber.  Occasionally, he would talk with the Slaad, but often as not, he would remain quiet, considering his path.  The strange tadpole like thing was still present as well (Linji once asked the Slaad what it was, and it answered, "Anixihtl Ixihotl" -meaning "Faceless-Face") Eventually, feeling his body renewed (literally) and his wounds all healed, Linji inquired of the Slaad as to what he should do.  The Slaad quickly asked, "MOcochayotiA" or "Have you eaten?"<br />
Linji replied, "QUeMa". (meaning "yes, for now").  <br />
The Blue Slaad then said, "PapAca iTitl" (go, wash your belly).</p>

<p>In that moment, Linji understood, got up and walked to the final chamber of the rthak'aai, and the next phase of the test.</p>

<p>Test of Mastery - This last to final test involves claiming the key item from where it lies in the rthak'aai maze. There is always some trick involved in this test - a guardian animate or inanimate, a choice between a true key and one or more false ones, the possibility of deception or similar failure. Claiming the key is the only way out of the rthak'aai maze - once a student enters, the entrance is sealed and cannot again be opened. A student who fails to find the rthak'aai key is condemned to a slow death of starvation and madness. </p>

<p>As Linji crossed the final threshold, he entered a near spherical room of stone.  All was dark in the room, except for the light that emanated from the apex of the room where a tendril of chaos-fame burned.  Its red glow revealed the presence of a black-cloaked figure, holding a scythe.  As Linji entered, the only exit formed into seamless stone, and the cloaked figure turned its gaze upon Linji; inside its dark hood, a skeletal visage with pin-points of light regarded the now-Chaond.  Its fleshless skull seemed almost too smile as it grasped its scythe in to hands, causing its weapon to burn black -only its flame gave off no heat, only destructive waves of raw entropy.  With equal suddenness, the Entropic Reaper charged Linji.<br />
Linji attempted to avoid the entropic scythe as best as he could, and it soon became apparent that he was no match for the creature -it would only be a matter of time before he felt's entropy's killing touch.  However, Linji did notice something else he had initially not seen -above the Entropic Reaper's hooded skull, orbited two small gray balls -iouns.  In an epiphany, Linji realized that these were the objects of which he sought -the key to the Rthak'aai ("These twins have no end, nor beginning; never stopping, unless stopped").  <br />
Unfortunately, Linji was unable to snatch the iouns, for the Entropic Reaper was too careful to guard its charges, furiously slashing to keep Linji at bay.  <br />
Linji attempted to shape the stone and knock the orbs away, but to no avail.  Quickly tiring, under the relentless onslaught, Linji began to despair of his doom, until he looked up at the flame again -in a serendipitous flash of insight, he realized that it was the same chaos-fire that he saw at the bottom of the cave-pool.  Still dodging the Reaper's scythe, Linji shaped the fire to then become water.  The walls shook, as the torrent from the ceiling crashed down upon Linji and the Entropic Reaper.  Quickly shaping a bubble of air around himself, Linji saw the undead Entropic Reaper submerged in the positive-energy infused waters, its skeletal form dissolving from the holy taint.  Waiting until its remains were totally consumed, Linji plucked the two ioun stones. No sooner did he do so, did the entire Rthak'aai island dissolve into the raw chaos of Limbo.  <br />
 <br />
Test of Survival - A student who claims the key, on the other hand, finds that the rthak'aai maze and all within it dissolves immediately into chaos. The student is then stranded alone in deep Limbo, with only the claimed key and any other tools they have found in their possession. The student's mentor will not arrive for a period of several hours at least; until that time, the student must survive on their own, mastering the primal chaos tides and hiding from or frightening off any creatures that come across the place. </p>

<p>Such was it for Linji as well.  Though, instead of waiting, Linji swam through the chaos-soup of Limbo, shaping his air, and flowing with the currents, the Tides of Chaos.  How long he drifted, he knows not, but eventually he was found -or he found someone -Torpellin of the Golden Spires.</p>

<p>And just as the Test of Mettle forever changed Linji's flesh and awakened his spirit, it would be Torpellin that would awaken his mind.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

They had never seen such mayhem.The ground was littered with corpses,all of which had been viciously clawed to death.<br />
"My gods.What did this?"a green recriut whispered his weapons clicking and clanking as he stood still qauking in fear.<br />
"The,the beast did it.You know of it do you not?The once man,now killer.They say he's seen the the edge of the world and the dead!"Another franticly cobbled together to explain the grusome sight.But it needed no explanation.Deep down they all knew he was here.Not some phantom beast,no a young man was the culprit.A young man with skin of metal and the power to see things best not seen.<br />
"So more have come?"The young man said to the mass of blue around him."Fine then they will perish for it."with inhuman speed he moved twoards them his skin glinting silver blue in the light.<br />
the soldiers never saw it coming.He lept upon the first a manical glee in his eyes and an evil smile ear to ear.with quick motions he severed away important organs till they were able to surround him.<br />
"Stop this man,can not see what you've done!?"one soldier yelled at the feral being.<br />
"I can.I know full well what I"ve done.I have <span style="font-style:italic">freed</span> them!"<br />
He screamed out as he slapped together his gloved hands.The area around him was engulfed in a pale red light and the screams of the dying could be heard.In the center of it all stood a lone figure smiling.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Ye gods men, have you gone mad? </p>

<p>Dialexis, that was good. Long, but good. A couple things though. Isn't the Slaadi implantation process supposed to be fatal? Besides, Chaonds are the decendents of those who have been *saved* from the implantation process. Wouldn't the Anarchs have tried to stop the test immediately once it looked like Linji was in real trouble?  What's the point in letting a promising student get turned into Slaad "food?" Once you adress these issues, I'll be happy as can be.</p>

<p>Perro, I'm only going to say this once: <span style="font-style:italic">put spaces after your punctuation!</span> Please, I'm begging you man. I know it's a simple mistake, but it makes your post almost painful to read. Once you fix that, I have to wonder about your psychopath angle. What I've found is insane killers make pretty good NPC's, but terrible PC's. There is simply no non-contrived reason for a slavering lunatic with psychoitic tendencies to share the company of anyone other than a psychiatric professional. Even fiends that go mad with bloodlust are hunted down and killed by their fellows eventually. A little sadism is fine, but try to keep it below "Serial Killer" levels. Also, do you have a character sheet up yet?</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>I believe this is your answer:<br />
<div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Claiming the key is the only way out of the rthak'aai maze - once a student enters, the entrance is sealed and cannot again be opened.

<p>It pertains to a different section of the test, but the point is they don't seem to see a reason to keep failures, even if they have promise.</p>

<p>As for Perro, I thought the same thing after reading the second part, WHY would this guy care to hang around us?

         <p>"Dialexis, that was good. Long, but good. A couple things though. Isn't the Slaadi implantation process supposed to be fatal? Besides, Chaonds are the decendents of those who have been *saved* from the implantation process. Wouldn't the Anarchs have tried to stop the test immediately once it looked like Linji was in real trouble? What's the point in letting a promising student get turned into Slaad "food?" Once you adress these issues, I'll be happy as can be."</p>

<p>Well, first -thanks for the compliment.  Secondly, I realize the post was long (usually the level of detail is something I create for all my PCs/NPCs, but is not exposed in such an open format, and thus is not so specifically posted though.  However, Linji can be pretty open for being such a seemingly cryptic character at time (and so for those other PCs that he knows beforehand, much of the specifity is relavant -but more so this would have all been relayed to a DM in most cases, or reserved for personal directive).</p>

<p>Now to answer your questions:</p>

<p>Yes, Blue Slaad Fever and Red Slaad Implantation are both methods of Slaadi reproduction that if the "host" fails its saves in a certain sequence, then the mortal dies.   </p>

<p>Linji never was "implanted" -only Red's do that -the Slaad Linji faced in the Rthak'aai was a Blue -instead, Linji was "infected" with Blue Slaad Fever.  He did not die from it, but instead eventually made the saves necessary for the chaos fever to run its course.  </p>

<p>As for Chaonds -unlike some of the more "lawful" exemplar-descendant races, Chaonds have been known to emerge/originate in a myriad of methods.  The most commonly stated method is where one is infected with Blue Slaad Fever, and makes it saves, but still acts as a "carrier" for the chaos vector, and hence their children are tainted/touched by Slaad -hecne Chaond.  A mortal could also be warped by the chaotic energies of Limbo in certain areas, infusing them with a portion of the plane (similar things happen in the Abyss), with the mortal then becoming a Chaond.  Likewise, a being that is implanted with a Red Egg, may still survive, but then carry the taint, transforming slightly when exposed to a source of anarchic energy.  </p>

<p>Thus, unlike the more commonly known plane-touched races of Tieflings and Aasimar and Genasi (who are the descendants of half-(celestial/fiend/elemental), Chaonds are not the descendants of "half-Slaadi" (such a thing might be possible, but would be conspicuous indeed, since there are no half-Slaad, just like there is not a half-Modron, but there are Mechanatrix).  </p>

<p>As befitting Limbo, CN's planetouched result from more varied origins.</p>

<p>Linji's existence is one such case -he was infected with Blue Slaad Fever -he made his saves, and thus did not die (or else he would have become a Red Slaad).  He survived, but not unscathed -he became a Chaond.  Why not merely surviving as a Githzerai alone?  The answers could be myriad: perhaps, because Linji already was more chaotic, or because he was he was training to become an Anarch, or because he was mid-way through a Rthak'aai in a Chaos-shaped island of Limbo, or because the Blue Slaad did something else to him.  Any of these are possibilities (the answer to which Linji does not know).</p>

<p>Create any absolute, and Chaos adapts and transforms to render the exception till their is no rule at all -thus is the way of chaos. </p>

<p>Ok, as for stopping the test -I think that was well said by the others: the Rthak'aai is not some coddled Good test -it is a potentially lethal test.  The Githzerai are an amoral people -vasicalting between the paradox of LN and CN.  Each "student" of a Rthak'aai chooses of their own volition to undergo the tests -none are ever forced.  Also, they are forewarned of the lethality of the tests as well.  <br />
For a teacher then to show compassion and prematurely stop the test, would be to deny agency (CN ethos) of the student, or to deny the consequnces of those choices (LN ethos).  <br />
To the Githzerai, the chance of death is a small price to pay to *know* oneself.</p>

<p>*also, there is a possibility that everything in Linji's Rthak'aai was exactly what his master-shaper wanted to happen -including the Chaond transformation -but this is only a theory plausible if Torpellin was his Sensei all along (a mystery that I will leave in the hands of the DM to ultimately decide).</p>

<p>Well, hope those answers clear up those questions.</p>

<p>Besides that -good to hear from Perro again -though I think the serial killer psychopath issue has been ably addressed, so I'll just ditto the previous remarks.</p>

<p>Oberoni_Fallacy &amp; Perro -how close are you to being done with the PC stats?  Not trying to rush you at all -just excited.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Oh, Chaos Fever, that would make more sense (it's been a while since I read about Slaadi), I got sent on the wrong track when you started talking about a mysterious blue blob. I thought you were talking about a partially formed Slaad. Guess I just went down the wrong mental track. I guess I could see them abondoning him anyway. Githzerai are sort of jerks.</p>

         <p>Duckluck,</p>

<p>I'm glad we're all of the same page (I realize that a good portion of the background was vague -such as the "Faceless-Face" but such was intentional -it leaves room for interpretation, while at the same time being not necessary to develop either).</p>

<p>As for Githzerai -Linji doesn't think they did anything wrong by "abandoning him".  Moreover, he doesn't consider it that he was abandoned.  As Githzerai are individualists, they believe that all experiences are in some ways, purely personal -only experienced/existing through the medium of the individual (and hence the necessity to *know* oneself).  </p>

<p>But, yes, from a moralistic standpoint -the amoral nature of Githzerai could be viewed as being uncaring jerks.</p>

<p>Also, I absolutely feel what you're saying relative to acronyms.  I don't want to offend any of the others, but I am often tempted to refer to JaggedOldRed as JOR and Oberoni_Fallacy as OF.</p>

<p>Thus, what are all of your desires relative to monikers?  Do such abbreviations bother you (if so, I'll use the full moniker; otherwise, acronyms will probably pop up here and there).</p>

<p>Either way, I'll be excited to see our "arcane-guy".</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Oh, by the way, the D&amp;D description of Cold Iron is nonsense. As <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_iron" class="bb-url">this</a> Wikipedia article will indicate, "Cold Iron" is just an old term for iron that is hammered without the aid of heating (which increases overall strength). It became embedded into fantasy through the myth that such iron represented the progress of industry and therefore would frighten away faeries and spirits. If anyone wants to come up with an elaborate explanation for why cold iron costs so much (after all, it's just normal iron that was worked a little differently), be my guest. Otherwise, we could just say it is mined from meteoric rock and/or just ignore it entirely.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Yeah, 300 would be awesome. Having said that, if you can think of something else to spend it on that’d benefit the party then go for it. I'm happy to pick up something along the way, it'd have more sentimental significance that way anyway. <br />
Also, Duckluck - Cold Iron's only double the price, I always figured that was because it meant that the smith had to work harder so he charged you double.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

          M`rek`s background!        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Here goes. As always, comments are most welcome!</p>

<p>As is common on the ethereal, M’rek’s story began some time before he was born. The Xasrii clan had once again been forced to move deeper into the ether to avoid coming into contact with expansionistic Githyanki. This time, their seer chose to go beyond all the marked expanses of the ethereal, as if drawn by a mysterious pull. Whatever it was, the seer’s vision was rewarded as the Xasrii deep trackers found a tiny pocket plane shaped like a small clearing, full of food, wood, and even fresh water. A veritable treasure trove for those used to the stark living on the ether. The clan could  stop and rest, and even plow the earth for as long as the plane’s nutrients allowed them too. It was while plowing, that M`rek’s mother, Miaat, a great warrior, first came upon the stone slab. It was a flat piece of limestone, etched with traces of silver and iron. Upon it were some bizarre inscriptions written on languages unknown even to the seers, as well as, and more surprisingly, warnings written in elvish, goblin, orc, dwarvish …and nathri. <br />
 <br />
The whole clan was set abuzz with the possibilities. Could they have stumbled upon a connection with the ancien homeland of the Nathri? Or was this a warning by one of their own who had managed to somehow escape the eternal cycle of life on the ethereal? <br />
 <br />
Whatever the case may be, S’leykh, the elder seer determined that the stone was not to be tampered with, for the warnings about becoming “the prey of oblivion” were indeed dire, and one thing that the Nathri had learned in their countless years of roaming the ethereal was to let sleeping dogs lye. <br />
 <br />
S’leykh wisdom would not prevent disaster indefinitely however, for the Githyanki slavers eventually found the Xasrii, who had grown complacent in their pocket paradise. The slavers descended with great speed and fury, capturing outright the majority of the clan’s warriors, including the mighty Miaat. It was then that love enters our story, for, you see, Miaat had been loved from a distance for a long time by one Delerek Tau, a clever rogue and master scavenger, who was, however, far beneath Miaat’s rank, and thus forbidden to offer courtship. The little Nathri had been one of the few who had managed to hide in the woods of   the pocket plane, and was forced to watch while his kin and beloved Miaat were overpowered by the Gith. It was then that he came up with an unlikely plan. Approaching the leader slaver, he offered the clan’s “treasure” in exchange for his brothers. Predictably, the Gith accepted the bargain with no intention of keeping up his part of it. But neither did Derelek. He took the assembled Gith to the stone slab and said that a great leader had been buried there, and all his treasure and weapons were laying with him. The greedy slavers did not think twice about despoiling the tomb of a lowly Nathri and immediately used their powers of telekinesis to lift the slab. <br />
 <br />
Immediately, a huge wolf-like creature jumped from the whole seizing the leader by his throat.  Three other smaller wolf-like creatures followed, but what made even the seasoned slavers recoil in horror was the ascension of their master. A huge man-like being with the head of a half putrefied bull carcass emerged from the tomb armed with a vicious looking spear. In his fury he laid about the Gith host with abandon, sometimes impaling two in one fell swing. One thing has to be said about the Githyanki: they know how to die, three knights, silverswords in hand, lead a charge against the stranger, only to be cut to shreds by the hunter and the wolves. </p>

<p>Shaking the waves of terror that threatened to paralyze him, Derelek run for the slave pens where he managed to free Miaat and most of his kin. The pragmatic Nathri fled, since the outcome of the battle was all but certain, and life would be counted in seconds for those Nathri who remained. Still, old S’leykh could not move very fast and Miaat, and the cream of Nathri warriors flocked around him, helping him on and acting as an informal bodyguard. Derelek, presuming much, for one so lowly, but made bold by the look of admiration and gratitude in Miaat’s eye, also joined the warriors. As soon as they thought to be beyond reach, the vicious looking iron spear, now soaked in Githyanki blood sped from the darkness to impale Zekher At, the clan’s master tracker. He died instantly. Fortunately, the hunter must have decided that the remaining Xasrii were beneath his contempt, for he refrained from pursuit, sending only his wolves after the clan. The Nathri knew the ether and knew how to hide, but the wolves were too fast and too close, they caught up in moments. </p>

<p>Powerful and wise S’leykh seemed to be the clans only hope, and he did not flinch from his duties. The ether was his element, he fought in good ground. As the wolves approached he regained his footing, and gathering his apprentices around he muttered a single word, Barghest, and, spitting to the side, summoned a great quantity of Nathri spirits in defense of the living. The formless souls flocked around the wolves, hampering their movement and distracting their minds. Then he lay about with the forces of the elements, blasting them with fire and lightning. Upon seeing the dreaded wolves yelp in pain, most of the brave, but foolish, warriors of the honor guard charged, screaming their indignation at the vile creatures…advancing bravely, but leaving S’leykh unprotected. Only Miaat had remained. This apparently was what the leader of the pack, the huge Barghest who had leaped from the tomb, ripping the Githianky wizard’s throat as if it were so much wet parchment, was waiting for. Seeing his true target unprotected, he bellowed to his pack, and magically appeared right next to the sage, while the other wolves began blinking in and out of existence, presenting a difficult target for the raging warriors. Blasting the apprentices and Miaat with a wail of despair, he then seized the seer on his jaws, denying him the use of magic. Miaat charged the demon, but her weapon was of little avail against his mystical defenses. Unchecked he was sure to claim the seer as his prey. But unchecked he was not, for little Derelek, who had managed to hide behind the seer’s robes and now contrived to straddle the wolf’s back, continuously stabbing its neck with his spike. The scavenger had an uncanny knack of finding the creature’s weak spot and the Barghest eventually had to release the seer in order to counter this new, annoyance…</p>

<p>But Derelek was not to be so easily denied and clung to the monster for dear life, even when it managed to seize the Nathri’s arm in his jaw, he continued to stab, and stab, and stab, vaguely aware of Miaat’s shouts and S’leykh’s incantations,  until the brute could take no more, and died still holding Derelek on its clenched jaws.</p>

<p>Now, you may or may not be aware that Nathri can and do eat anything. What you probably do not know is that, after a fierce battle, it is customary to hold a great feast, in honor of the spirits departed and of those who presented themselves to help the clan. For this feast, the Nathri bring out the finest drinks and foods they were able to buy or scavenge. It is also a fact that they eat their fallen foes, especially those who fought fiercely or bravely. It is a commonly held belief that by doing so, the Nathri can acquire part of the foes fearsome qualities, and so benefit the clan as a whole. Derelek, for his bravery, got to eat the Barghest’s heart! </p>

<p>The feast is also an occasion for revelry and abandon, a celebration of life and hope during which all concerns for rank and commitment are relaxed. The many Nathri which are born after such rare feasts are considered “children of the Clan”, as it might be next to impossible to determine with any degree of certainty the child’s male parent. It was thus, that six months after the killing  the Barghest, Miaat gave birth to a funny looking little whelp. The child’s Nathri-green skin was streaked with deep blue markings, reminiscent of an animal of prey. His eyes were the color of minted copper, and his large, wide mouth filed with more sharp teeth than even a Nathri had a right to possess, and a funnily crooked left ear. <br />
It was thus that Mrek was raised as a “child of the clan”, learning some of the skills from every member of the Xasrii: magic, guile, lore and scavenging (he was very good at scavenging). </p>

<p>After  his apprenticeship ears had passed and Mrek had tasted victory and defeat quite a few times living the dangerous lives of the Nathri, S’leykh summoned him and laid a geas on the young Nathri. </p>

<p>“You are to leave the clan and journey to the great city of  Spire, and there find those dancing to the rhymes of the Hissing Prophet. Tell them that: ‘ Even in the ether the echoes of doom can now be heard. The seers of the Nathri are all in agreement that the ether is  growing…thin…and that something beyond wants passage… this has to be prevented’ . Also, my son, you are to join the band of those would go into the outlands, listen and learn, and act, you have been forged into a weapon of the Xasrii, now you will learn to be deadly, like the demon wolf blood that runs in your veins. Do not forget us, but do grow beyond what we could ever teach you, that is your duty. Erxplore and learn, and, remember, keep order and chaos  together, bounded, as they should be, even if you have to kill both of them…”</p>

<p>After this, M’rek’s day amongst his clan were brief. Every single  brother came bearing gifts, humble and precious tokens of  power or  hope. He paid respect to all his parents, and a special, long, warm, embrace to his mother, the mighty Miaat. Finally, as he was living, already at some distance from the clan, derelek caught up with him, gave him a warm and sunny embrace and pressed an odd looking hat upon his had: “remember to get out of the way of the bigger folks with the biggest mouths, go around them, learn to be small, they are not in your way if they are already behind you”. <br />
With that the small Nathri gave him a great affectionate hug and sent M’rek away, crying silent tears and scratching  his funnily bent left ear.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>how do you delete a double post here?</p>

<p>Also I rather like cold iron and the idea of special materials...cold iron as OF had said is not expensive in istelf, but the idea is that it is somehow inimical to certain magic, and thus harder to enchant (thus the extra 2000 cost to enchant). <br />
I like  special materials also because they would leave at least a chance for a porr village community to fend of an attack by damage resistant creatures...they make a lot of sense to me (and M`rek is heavily invested on that idea...as you can see from his equipment lists)<br />
PS: will edit M`rek today to reflect some minnor skill and purchase differences, but otherwise am ready and very happy to start the game over the weekend!!</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>JaggedOld Red,</p>

<p>Wow! I love your character bio -great job.  I especially like the development you are giving to the Nathri (especially with the spirit-shaman tie-ins -reminds me a lot of several Native American tribal, nomadic societies).  I'm also very intrigued with the concept of the race as being "lost" -searching for a home, a place for their spirits to rest.  (I also like how they are godless -very appropriate).  In some aspects, their culture seems to have a lot of similarities (spiritually) with the Githzerai -which makes even more sense as Limbo and the Ethereal have many similarities.</p>

<p>I also love the work you did for M'rek's origins -the twist in explaining his fiendish bloodline is awesome.  (eating the heart once again hearkening back to the Native American ambience).  I also really like it because M'rek's descent comes from niether a Baatezu nor a Tanar'ri, but a Gehennan fiend -a barghest.  Very cool indeed (and nicely done since they have ethereal ties with several of their SLA's).  </p>

<p>You may want to ask Duckluck if you could gain an alternative SLA as a tiefling, since Barghests have no such darkness abilities -but it is just a thought.</p>

<p>Any further thoughts on what exactly the Hunter was -a ghost, or barrow-wight, or something else?</p>

<p>My only point of contention is the Githyanki tie-in.  True, the Githyanki are Expansionistic, cruel, and capricious, but their activities are really centered on the Astral, and the Prime (as well as Hell, since they have an affiliation with Tiamat).  </p>

<p>Unless there is some strong reason to keep them as antagonists (since it seems arbitrary), I'd suggest making the "githyanki" portion of the story be replaced with some other race that actually is present and prevalent on the Ethereal.</p>

<p>The one that most clearly comes to my mind are the Ethergaunts -super-scary, and powerful (enough that most Nathri would definately run away from them), and they are evil to the core (and thus would have collected the Nathri tribe members for experiments or spell components, or slave to drive infernal machines, etc).  <br />
The Etherguants also would have been eager to seize sites of power -and their pride could have blinded them to the potential consequences. (especially if they were a group of Red Etherguants led by a White Etherguant).  <br />
They also would have been susceptible to the sheer physical attacks of the barghests &amp; Hunter.  </p>

<p>This is just one option of Ethereal inhabitants, but probably the most suitable  -since their are expansionistic, merciless, heartless, and arrogant, and most of all -their center of presence is the Ethereal.</p>

<p>Just trying to help.</p>

<p>Along the same line of thinking, here are some things I noticed about M'rek's character sheet:</p>

<p>You haven't added his Strength modifier to his damage with his spike and his dagger.</p>

<p>Also, you have the crossbow's threat range as listed as 18-20, where it should only be 19-20.</p>

<p>Maybe I am wrong, but I think MW thieves' tools also grant a +2 to Open Lock checks as well as Disable Device.</p>

<p>As a small creature, with a speed less than 20, I believe you also take a small penalty to Jump checks (-4?) -However, I have no idea how this will work out with the Houserule on Acrobatics (since Climb should be unaffected).</p>

<p>You gain a +2 synergy bonus to Balance due to your ranks in Tumble.</p>

<p>I believe a silk rope grants a +2 to Use Rope checks.</p>

<p>You have a sling listed, but no ammo (are you just planning on using rocks?  -remember they do less damage -1d2 for small sized rocks).  Otherwise, you'll need sling bullets, which are only a sp, but wiegh 5 lbs for 10.</p>

<p>As you second spell -are you doing Sure Strike or True Strike?</p>

<p>Other than those issues, all looks good to go.</p>

<p>And yes, I'm looking forward to starting as well (but am relatively content to wait if need be since the communal creation phase has been very enjoyable).</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Thanks for the input Dialexis (by the way no problem shortening to JoR). I also think the Nathri got more fleshed out as a culture, and it gives me a background against which to play...clanish societies have a huge imprint on their members, and I tought M`rek needed some cultural anchors.<br />
Also, by the way, great job with Linji, it is one of the first times I see chaos being well portrayed in role-playing...</p>

<p>Now to address your questions/coments:<br />
If Duck wants to exchange darknbess for any barghest ability I probably would not mind, as long as it makes sense for the character (not rage, for instance)...maybe blink? that would be fun... but if not, it`s still fine...darkness is prety useful for a rogue...</p>

<p>Yes, I got it completely wrong on the Githyanki, tought they lived on the ethereal...anyway, ethergaunts would do just fine...I just need a cruel, expansionistic culture...anyone <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/lol.png" title="Laughing out loud" alt="Laughing out loud" class="smiley-content"/> </p>

<p>I'll adjust the damages on the sheet, and also some skills...and you are right the jump should be adjusted, but only for running leaps, that`s why I did not chenge the sheet</p>

<p>mmm, I'm hesitating about the true strike...I would have access to it through the assassin spells...maybe something I could not get otherwise like shield (or even prot vs evil, but would it work against outsiders in their plane??) Or in Sigil? <br />
well, it helps that I could always get spells, or wands of those spells also...</p>

<p>Also I did not know that silk rope gave +2 o use rope, will adjust balance, and did not give +2 on open locks because DKLK merged the two skills.</p>

<p>Ah. Yes, the sling! It is a weapon of last resort which M`rek uses to braid his long hair...it is almost certain to avoid discovery and can be used with stones, as you said...when you are a rogue or assassin, weapon damage is not really the focus (otherwise my primary ranged weapon is the crossbow).</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>He ties his hair with a sling? You're kidding! That's actually not bad. Just so long as you don't try to hide a dagger in your boot, I'll allow it. Tangentially the cliched Dagger in the boot wouldn't work because daggers are at least six inches long, at least two inches across at the hilt, and at least an inch thick, and that's without the sheath, and you do <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> want to be walking around with an unsheathed blade in your shoe.</p>

<p>I like the background, although I'd agree that it doesn't make much sense to have Githyanki, but hey, we all make mistakes. My other question is, what was that "bull-headed hunter" guy? A Gorisro with leprosy?</p>

<p>First of all, Tiefers don't get Darkness anymore, they get the much better<a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/divine/spells/blacklight.htm" class="bb-url">Blacklight</a>, second, any SLA swapping will cost you a munch point, maybe two, and third, blink doesn't work on the Outer Planes (no ethereal connection), which makes you wonder why Barghest have it in the first place, eh?</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Thanks everyone for the feedback so far...<br />
DkLk: yep, my memory betrayed me and I misplaced the living space of the Githyanky. I'll be ok with any change in this regard, and the ether-gaunts seem to be a good choice, just consider the races flipped.</p>

<p>The Imprisoned creature beneath the slab can be anything the DM desires, it is a big, fat, plot hook in case you need one...It could be a demon, or a demon lord, a ghost, or a creature from "beyond time and space", or an ancient imprisoned god, which has a link to the Nathri past... whatever, take your pick, just do not tell me....</p>

<p>Also thanks for liking the sling, idea, I think it fits with M`reks scavenger/tricky  origins...but just to clarify, will you allow us to hide daggers in our clothes as per the rules under sleight of hand, I planed to hide at least two more daggers in my clothes and pants...</p>

<p>Finally, I`ll keep my munchies and take the blacklight...as I said it fits the character, now even more...</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Jor: Ethergaunts are where it's at. Thanks for the plot hook. Expect it to come up again (they always do). You can hide daggers in your clothes sure, just probably not your boots, because that's just plain stupid. Lastly, Jor, would you like to explain how M'rek got to Sigil, or may I do the honors?</p>

         <p>Actually it makes a lot of sense that I'd have offered this service to customers (and then to party members once I stop being a tout). It'd give me a point of difference to sell ("help you with that load cutter?") and gives me leverage if they try to weasel out of paying.</p>

         <p>Azriael,</p>

<p>Good call on the Shemmie thread - he(she) is the best!  As a devoted fan of the SH, I have to admit seeing the union of those two =especially with the spoilers of SH#2.  But woa, didn't know all those details yet -good stuff.  </p>

<p>About the MW cold iron dao -are you sure?  I mean, you are buying something for the group's benefit (meta-game wise).  At the same time, Linji likes Kadar a lot, and the nature of giving, and the transitory movement of "masks" is not such a big deal to him (made even more so since among the Githzerai, there is no such thing as private property, all is mutual property -the whole benevolent anarchy thing).</p>

<p>As such, I think Linji would definately buy him a nice sword.</p>

<p>Perro,</p>

<p>The site you gave still doesn't work.  Did you make it public?</p>

<p>OF, any progress?  (I know picking spells can be a beast at the beginning).</p>

<p>JoR,</p>

<p>Once again, really awesome bio, and character development.  I like the hair tie of the sling (maybe Linji can wear his as a Chaond Thong?).  </p>

<p>And yeah, it would have been nice for both our PCs to be Githyanki haters, but it didn't make sense -(I had assumed you had flipflopped the two planar sites).  </p>

<p>Switching it to Etherguants definately work -they are really cool, and are a neat element, though now I must kick myself for suggesting them due to Duckluck's promise-threat of using them (Etherguants are WICKED tough).  </p>

<p>Korchuk, </p>

<p>Do you know how long Cortek has been in Sigil?  (I am assuming we are all starting there, but I could be wrong).  I know I asked about faction allegiance, but was wondering if he was part of the Minder's Guild -it sounds right up his alley.  Then again, if you aren't wearing the Guild uniform, Linji probably wouldn't know, so its really me just being curious (nosey?).</p>

<p>Duckluck,</p>

<p>I love your avatar picture -as I have said before, the Spire and its denziens are indeed my top favorites (namesake and all and avatar included).  That said, I love the picture (and concept and stats for the Concordant Killer).  The picture works well -though is a nice, but scary element of foreshadowing.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

Agreed, I have a nasty feeling we'll be running across one or two of those given the subject of the campaign. </p>

<p>Dialexis – The more I think about it the more I’m leaning towards declining your (and Linjis’) generous offer. I’ll probably end up discarding that sword at some point for something with a bit more character/upgradeability and I’d feel terrible doing that to a gift.  <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/sad.png" title="Sad" alt="Sad" class="smiley-content"/> <br />
Thankyou very much though, it was really nice of you to offer. The money could also probably be better spent on something which benefits the whole group rather than giving me an extra +1 on my off hand. <br />
I’m also kind of liking the balanced image of one sword being all pretty and shiny and the other looking dull and roughly hammered out.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I don't know what the Minder's Guild is, or if I do I've never heard it referred to that way. Where can I look that up? It's not under factions unless I missed something. As for if it's right up his alley I can't say right now, but I haven't done the long background that you and JOR have, you could be more off than you think, I'll get to that right away actually.</p>

<p>How long he's been in Sigil? He's never been there, and if we begin there, he just arrived within the planar day. He only understands cant tentatively, doesn't really speak it, had he had a longer tenure with the Harmonium he probably would've learned it in full. His knowledge of Sigil is entirely from hearsay and general knowledge, he understand what the Dabus are, the Lady of Pain is and does, the Faction War, and that it has portals to just about everywhere. He knows very little about the actual wards, basically he knows the Hive is a giant slum, and that there are a bunch of other wards too(i.e. not much beyond the obvious.)</p>

<p>EDIT: Ok, I remember now, I forgot about that part. Yeah, he would probably fit with the Minder's Guild somewhat ideologically, but he sure wouldn't be a member, having never been to Sigil previous to this campaign.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">
