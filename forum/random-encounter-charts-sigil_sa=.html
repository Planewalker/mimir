      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>You might want to break it down into categories. I would suggest three categories: general/common, specific and weird</p>

<p>For example, some "general/common" things can happen just about anywhere (vendor tries to get your attention, kid comes up and begs for a copper, etc.)<br />
Other things only happen in specific neighborhoods. In The Lady's Ward, Harmonium patrols would be a semi-common occurance. Not so much in the Hive<br />
Finally, there should be a smaller chance for something really outlandish which I've lumped under "weird"</p>

<p>Do you want ideas for all of these types? Do you want combat AND non-combat ones?</p>

<p>For "General/Common", here are some suggestions (although some of the later ones might be "Specific" for the Lower Ward or the Hive):<br />
-Argument/duel occurs in street – between ex-lovers, fighters, merchants, mages or faction members<br />
-Street corner entertainer – perhaps enticing to a formal paid performance (e.g. give you just a glimpse of the circus to get you to come to the paid performance)<br />
-Merchant tries to get your attention<br />
-Trader leading a small group of pack animals<br />
-Group of adventurers or caravan guards return home and are acting rowdy with their new wealth<br />
-Hardhead patrol<br />
-Mugging or pickpocket seen (PCs not the target)<br />
-Important person passes by in sedan chair with guards<br />
-Mildly insane man mumbling to himself or shouts insults at passerbys<br />
-Hardheads or Mercykillers chasing someone through the streets<br />
-Lost Clueless just arrived in Sigil, trying to get their bearings<br />
-Urchins torment a stray dog or cranium rat<br />
-Drunkard<br />
-Beggar/urchin<br />
-Someone dumps privy water from window overhead<br />
-Two or more gathered and whisper to each other while looking over their shoulders<br />
-Lady of the evening tries to entice the PCs<br />
-Stray dog follows the party hoping for a scrap</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I got these from a website a long time ago. I forget which. They're all second edition monsters, but it's still a really good set of charts. </p>

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>And here are the descriptions from the site. Feel free, of course, to substitute other or later-edition monsters where appropriate. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.mimir.net/cant/cant2.html" class="bb-url">Voila!s Cant Dictionary</a> may be helpful in deciphering the "sods, bashers, and high-up men" section. It isn't spelled out, but greenskirts, jinkskirts, and mertskirts are almost definitely different classes of prostitute, named for Sigilian slang for copper, gold, and platinum coins.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline"><span style="font-weight:bold">Monsters</span></span><br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Al-Jahar:</span> MCA I, p.11 - Dazzles, as the al-jahar are also known, feed upon strong emotions. They prefer to dwell in cities where they can easily cause strife and fights with their minor magical abilities. Quite a few have grown fat and happy in the Cage's turbulent environment. Align = NE, # = 1, HD = 5, Int = very <br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Ammut: </span>Al-Qadim MC - A weird cross between lion, hippo, man and crocodile, the ammut is a supernatural monster that preys on spirits of the evil and the damned. They lair under the Cage's streets, tunneling to the surface during the dark hours to gorge on fiends and evil petitioners. Align = NE, # = 1-12, HD = 6, Int = ave. <br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Baldanar:</span> Mystara MC, p.11 - Strict carnivores, these master illusionists are incapable of dealing with other races without considering them prey. They may dwell amongst men for a time, but always for the purposes of gathering personal power and increasing the size of their larder. Align = NE, # = 1, HD = 6, Int = exc. <br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Bastellus:</span> Ravenloft MC I - Also known as dream stalkers, the looming, shadowy, seldom-seen bastellus feed on bad dreams and nightmares. Insubtantial and undead, they slink amongst the sleeping, causing and eating the terrors of the night. Align = NE, # = 1, HD = 4, Int = ave. <br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Brain Mole: </span>MM, p.29 - Tiny brain moles burrow about under the Cage, feeding on the psionic abilities of the many psychics who visit and dwell here. They're rather common vermin here, and some high-ups keep them deliberately to frustrate psionicists. Align = N, # = 1-3, 1 HP, Int = animal <br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Carrionette:</span> MCA I, p.11 - Carrionettes are parasites, traitorously evil animated puppets who have come to life and turned on their masters. They hunt through the Cage seeking bodies to steal in their quest to acquire living forms of their own. Align = CE, # = 2-8, HD = 2, Int = ave. <br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Feyr:</span> MM, p.116 - Spawned by the mix of emotions and magic found in cities like the Cage, feyrs are hideous, inhuman, hunchbacked creatures. They haunt the night, feeding on fear and causing chaos and terror. Roll 1d10:<br />
1-6 Common Feyr: Align = CE, # = 1-4, HD = 4, Int = low<br />
7-10 Great Feyr: Align = CE, # = 1, HD = 16, Int = high <br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Gargoyle:</span> MM, p.125 - These animated architectural grotesques dot the roofs of the Cage, especially in the Lady's Ward. But they've grown canny over the years, and tend to attack pedestrians only when they're sure no one else is watching. Roll 1d10:<br />
1-6 Gargoyle: Align = CE, # = 2-16, HD = 4+4, Int = low<br />
7-10 Margoyle: Align = CE, # = 2-8, HD = 6, Int = low <br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Ghostlight:</span> PSMC II, p.40-41 - The planar version of the will o'wisp also dwells and hunts in the Cage. Cager ghostlights prefer the Hive ward, with its greater concentration of murders in the night, but they stalk the other wards as well. Align = CE, # = 1, HD = 7, Int = genius <br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Harrla:</span> FRMC I - Naturally invisible and intangible, the harrla has no method of physically affecting the Cage. It warps and feeds on emotions, draining away personalities as it whipsaws the souls of its victims. Align = CE, # = 1, HD = 4+3, Int = very <br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Leucrotta, Greater:</span> MCA II, p.78 - Unlike their lesser cousins, changesteeds can alter their forms as well as their voices. They use this ability to hunt amongst humans within their very cities. They're also quite intelligent and will ally with cross-traders to acheive greater goals. Align = NE, # = 1-3, HD = 8, Int = very <br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Lycanthrope:</span> MM, p.230-231 - There is no lunar influence in the Cage, so lycanthropic curses don't mean as much here. Typically, the were-cursed appear no different from any other basher. But when they do manifest their animalistic form in the Cage, their wilder urges predominate. There are many, many types of lycanthropes. These are the most common (roll 1d10):<br />
1 Werebear: MM, p.234 - Align = CG, # = 1-4, HD = 7+3, Int = exc.<br />
2-3 Wereboar: MM, p.235 - Align = N, # = 2-8, HD = 5+2, Int = ave.<br />
4 Werefox: MM, p.236 - Align = CE, # = 1 (+slaves), HD = 8+1, Int = ave-exc.<br />
5-7 Wererat: MM, p.237 - Align = LE, # = 4-24, HD = 3+1, Int = very<br />
8 Weretiger: MM, p.239 - Align = N, # = 1-6, HD = 6+2, Int = ave.<br />
9-10 Werewolf: MM, p.240 - Align = CE, # = 3-18, HD = 4+3, Int = ave. <br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Magebane:</span> MCA I, p. 81 - These invisible, parasitic bat-like creatures are drawn to the Cage and its many spellslingers like moths to flame. They eat only magical power, but have become so annoying here that many factions have standard rewards posted and paid for magebane corpses. Align = CN, # = 1, HD = 2+4, Int = low <br />
Mimic: The Cage's transient population and chaotic architecture make it an ideal hunting ground for mimics. All kinds thrive here, even the rarer ones. Roll 1d10:<br />
1-3 Common: MM, p.250 - Align = N, # = 1, HD = 7-8, Int = ave.<br />
4-5 Greater: MCA II, p.87 - Align = N, # = 1, HD = 15-16, Int = very-high<br />
6-7 House-Hunter: MCA I, p.84-85 - Align = N, # = 1-4, HD = 10-20, Int = semi-ave.<br />
8-10 Killer: MM, p.250 - Align = N, # = 1, HD = 9-10, Int = semi<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Palimpsest:</span> MCA II, p.93 - Particularly dangerous in the Clerk's Ward, these magical, life-eating animated pieces of paper and parchment can spring unexpectedly on a cutter. Hailing originally from the Ethereal plane, palimpsests are distressingly common in the paper-crammed parts of the Cage. Align = N, # = 1, HD = 1-10, Int = semi <br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Peltast:</span> MCA II, p.94 - Peltast are weird little leather and silicon parasites, almost indistinguishable from inanimate objects. An encounter with one is rarely recognized for what it is. Only the greater peltast's tendency to summon monsters and suggest combat is likely to betray their presence. Roll 1d10:<br />
1-7 Common - Align = N, # = 1, HD = 1+6, Int = ave.<br />
8-10 Greater - Align = N, # = 1, HD = 2+6, Int = exc. <br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Ragamoffyn:</span> MCA II, p.100-101 - Similar to the peltast, ragamoffyn are sentient scraps of cloth, leather and metal. They seek to engulf humanoid hosts and compel them to do their collective bidding. Roll 1d10 for type:<br />
1-2 Tatterdemanimal - Align = N, # = 1-6, HD = 1, Int = low<br />
3-6 Ragamoffyn - Align = CN, # = 1-4, HD = 3, Int = ave.<br />
7-8 Gutterspite: - Align = N, # = 1-3, HD = 5, Int = very<br />
9-10 Common: - Align = CE, # = 1-2, HD = 7, Int = high <br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Shapeshifter: </span>There are a fair number of shape-altering humanoids that hunt other bipeds by imitating their forms. All have found their way into the Cage at one time or another, to enjoy the variety of prey that comes here. Roll 1d10:<br />
1-5 Doppelganger: MM, p.60 - Align = N, # = 3-12, HD = 4, Int = very<br />
6-7 Doppelganger, greater: MCA II, p.43 - Align = NE, # = 1-4, HD = 9, Int = exc-genius<br />
8-9 Polymar: Mystara MC, p.96-97 - Align = LN, # = 1-3, HD = 10, Int = low<br />
10 Randara: Mystara MC, p.96-97 - Align = NE, # = 1, HD = 14, Int = high <br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Vampyre:</span> Ravenloft MC I - Vampyre (pronounced 'Vam-peer') are not undead, but resemble vampires closely in their appearance and appetite. They move amongst humanity as do other sociopaths, killing when and where it suits their needs. Align = CE, # = 3-12, HD = 8+3, Int = exc. </p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline"><span style="font-weight:bold">Undead</span></span><br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Arch-Shadow: </span>MCA II, p.10-11 - Arch-shadows are failed liches who nevertheless weren't totally destroyed in the process of becoming undead. They are extremely rare, but those that have 'survived' often come to the Cage while researching ways to destroy all forms of life. Align = E(any), # = 1, HD = 11+, Int = supra-genius <br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Bhut:</span> Mystara MC, p.13 - Bhuts (pronounced Bah-Hoots) still cling to a modicum of life. They cannot be turned and appear normal during the day. But at night they metamorphose into scaly, fanged, ice-cold monsters, whose only desire is to feast on living flesh. Align = LE, # = 2-8, HD = 7+2, Int = very <br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Corpse:</span> Corpses are simply that: dead bodies. At the DM's option, they may be infested with parasites or a disease, but the thrust of this encounter is the basic horror and mystery of stumbling across a dead body. Choose race and social class for the deader or roll on the appropriate Racial or Cager tables. <br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Diseased:</span> Numerous maladies infect those who visit the Cage, and the party has stumbled into one of the worst afflicted. Whether suffering from leprosy, mummy rot, a debilitating infection from the Gray Waste, or some more esoteric disease, the poor creature enountered is in no shape to do anything more than beg for mercy. He/she is infectious in close proximity, and DMs should require saving throws from all party members to avoid acquiring a like condition. Race and social class of the diseased can be chosen or rolled for on the Racial and Cager tables. <br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Ghost:</span> MM, p.130 - Ghosts are rare in the Cage, mostly because none seem to originate from the many deaths its streets see. These ethereal spirits all seem to have crossed over into the Cage via portals, like every other visitor. They act doubly outraged, both from the tragic event that caused their ghostliness and at being stranded here. Align = LE, # = 1, HD = 10, Int = high <br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Ghoul:</span> MM, p.131 - Ghasts and Ghouls think the Cage is a marvelous hunting ground, filled with human victims. They lurk in the night, seeking revolting and loathsome pleasures, when they aren't being recruited by the Dustmen. Roll 1d10:<br />
1-6 Ghoul - Align = CE, # = 2-24, HD = 2, Int = low<br />
7-10 Ghast - Align = CE, # = 1-4, HD = 4, Int = very <br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Gray Philosopher:</span> Mystara MC, p.55 - All types of philosophers, including spectral undead ones borne down by the weight of evil speculation, come to the Cage. Even here, though, these malicious ponderers and their dangerous thoughts are abhorred. Align = NE, # = 1, HD = 9, Int = high <br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Haunt:</span> MM, p.186 - Driven to complete some vital task from beyond the grave, haunts are as common in the Cage as elsewhere. A surprising number of desparate souls refuse to give up on the dreams that brought them to Sigil, even when written into the dead-book. Align = any, # = 1, HD = 5, Int = non <br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Lhiannan Shee:</span> FRMC I - These enchanting, bard-hunting, female spirits can be found wandering the Cage, looking for new trophy-boys to slay. The "ghosts of obsession" are known to frequent areas that Sensates find popular. Align = CE, # = 1-4, HD = 4, Int = very <br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Lich:</span> MM, p.222-223 - The classic intellectual undead, liches are rare in the Cage only because they're rare, period. If any place in creation has seen more than its share of dead arch-magi passing through, it's Sigil. Align = E(any), # = 1, HD = 11+, Int = supra-genius <br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Nightshade:</span> Mystara MC, p.83-84 - These deadly unliving denizens of the negative material plane rival even the most powerful fiends with their ferocity and evil genius. Fortunately for the Cage, only the jet-black, giant humanoids of the species, the Nightwalkers, have ever been seen here, and those most rarely. Align = CE, # = 1, HD = 21, Int = supra-genius <br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Petitioner:</span> Dead but bland, petitioners in the Cage are often lost or engaged in simple missions for their deity. If it weren't for their waxy looks and blank eyes, they would be difficult to distinguish from normal sods. Align = any, # = 1-10, HD = 0, Int = ave. <br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Phantom:</span> MM, p.287 - These relatively harmless images of death don't last long in the Cage, as they are usually exorcised soon after reports of one are discovered. But the party may have encountered a new one, and might gain useful information from the replay of the phantom's death throes. Align = N or E, # = 1, HD = nil, Int = nil <br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Shadow:</span> MM, p.312 - Relatively common near portals to the negative material plane, shadows are difficult to detect in the Cage's dim light. They cluster in dank alleys and ambush the living when they can. Align = CE, # = 2-20, HD = 3+3, Int = low <br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Spectre:</span> MM, p.323 - With their hatred of light and life only dimmed somewhat by the Cage's hazy atmosphere, spectres remain one of the more dangerous (and non-tolerated) undead encountered in the city. Once detected, they tend to be eradicated by high-ups before they can sweep through the cage, annhilating all living beings in their path. Align = LE, # = 1-6, HD = 7+3, Int = high <br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Vampire:</span> There is a small contingent of vampires who dwell relatively peacably in the Cage. They try to minimize their depredations so as not to suffer the fate of the less-discerning spectres. Roll 1d10 to determine the race of the vampire encountered:<br />
1-6 Human: MM, p.355-356 - Align = CE, # = 1-4, HD = 8+3, Int = exc.<br />
7 Dwarf: Ravenloft MC I - Align = NE, # = 1, HD = 9+3, Int = very<br />
8 Elf: Ravenloft MC I - Align = LE, # = 1, HD = 7+3, Int = genius<br />
9 Gnome: Ravenloft MC I - Align = CE, # = 1, HD = 6+3, Int = genius<br />
10 Halfling: Ravenloft MC I - Align = CE, # = 1, HD = 6+3, Int = high <br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Wight:</span> MM, p.360 - Sepulchural and crypt-dwelling, wights are seldom encountered even in the Cage's poor excuse for daylight. Unless allied with Dustmen, they seek only to consume and transform the living into more of their own kind. Align = LE, # = 2-16, HD = 4+3, Int = ave. <br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Wraith:</span> MM, p.365 - Wraiths act much like wights in the Cage, only there is a slightly greater chance to reason with them. Most of the time, though, they simply seek to destroy the hated living. Align = LE, # = 2-12, HD = 5+3, Int = very </p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline"><span style="font-weight:bold">Fiends</span></span><br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Baatezu, Greater:</span> PSMC 16 - The Baatezu are the proponents of diabolism in the Blood War. The greater of their kind have somewhat more freedom than the lesser, and come to the Cage to plot attacks and deal darkly with the populace in efforts to further the War. Roll 1d10:<br />
1-2 Amnizu (Styx Devil): PSMC, p.19 - Align = LE, # = 1-2, HD = 9, Int = exc.<br />
3-6 Cornugon (Horned Devil): PSMC, p.21 - Align = LE, # = 1-4, HD = 10, Int = exc.<br />
7-8 Gelugon (Ice Devil): PSMC, p.23 - Align = LE, # = 1-8, HD = 11, Int = genius<br />
9-10 Pit Fiend: PSMC, p.28 - Align = LE, # = 1-4, HD = 13, Int = genius<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Baatezu, Least:</span> PSMC 16 - Least Baatezu are barely sentient, and are almost always kept in line by a lesser baatezu. Bezekira are the smartest of the lot, but are only technically least baatezu. Their form is usually a punishment for the more powerful devils. Roll 1d10:<br />
1-2 Bezekira (Hellcat): PoLMS, p.12-13 - Align = LE, # = 1, HD = 7+2, Int = ave.<br />
3-4 Lemure: PSMC, p.25 - Align = LE, # = 10-40, HD = 2, Int = semi<br />
5-6 Nupperibo: PSMC, p.26 - Align = LE, # = 1-30, HD = 1, Int = animal<br />
7-10 Spinagon (Spined Devil): PSMC, p.29 - Align = LE, # = 1-3, HD = 3+3, Int = low<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Baatezu, Lesser:</span> PSMC 16 - Lesser Baatezu in the Cage are usually running an errand for one of their many masters, or riding herd on a batch of least baatezu. But they are always trying to implement some scheme to improve their lot. Roll 1d10:<br />
1-2 Abishai (Scaly Devil): PSMC, p.18 - Align = LE, # = 1-8, HD = 4+, Int = ave.<br />
3-4 Barbazu (Bearded Devil): PSMC:20 - Align=LE, #=4-16, HD = 6+6, Int = ave-very<br />
5-6 Erinyes (Flesh Devil): PSMC, p.22 - Align = LE, # = 1, HD = 6+6, Int = high<br />
7-8 Hamatula (Barbed Devil): PSMC, p.24 - Align = LE, # = 3-12, HD = 7, Int = very<br />
9 Kocrachon (Plated Devil): PoLMS:10 - Align=LE, #=3-18, HD = 6+6, Int = high<br />
10 Osyluth (Bone Devil): PSMC, p.27 - Align = LE, # = 2-8, HD = 5, Int = very <br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Barghest:</span> PSMS, p.6-7 - Usually mistaken for goblins, these Gehennan-native fiends are cunning hunters and avaricious treasure-seekers.

<span style="font-weight:bold">Rilmani- Cuprilach / Abiorach:</span> PSMC II, p.84 - Cuprilach and abiorach are the agents provocateur of the rilmani race.

They also frequent the Cage, to train as well as to mark their targets. Roll 1d10:<br />

<span style="font-weight:bold">Rilmani- Plumach / Ferrumach:</span> PSMC II, p.84 - Although they don't travel as much as the other rilmani, ferrumach and plumach may still be seen in the Cage.

<span style="font-weight:bold">Slaadi, Greater:</span> PSMC, p.88,91 - Slaadi do not make distinctions of 'least', 'lesser', and 'greater' amongst themselves, except for determining how dangerous a particular slaad may be in combat. But more organized taxonomers note that greater slaadi are those with mighty magical powers and great physical prowess. They are also capable of entertaining concerns beyond their current whim, and visit the Cage sometimes to further their plans. Roll 1d10:<br />

<span style="font-weight:bold">Slaadi, Least:</span> PSMC, p.88,91 - Least Slaadi are the stupid ones of their kind, the weaker and smaller which must defer to their aggressive cousins. Most do so by hiding in the depths of Limbo, but some make their way to the Cage where they can inflict their chaos on others without concern for being eaten or bullied. Roll 1d10:<br />

<span style="font-weight:bold">Tso:</span> PSMC II, p.116-117 - The spell-slinging, slaving, contract-signing Tso are common sights in the cage.

<span style="font-weight:bold">Aaracokra: </span>MM, p.5 - Aaracokra are bird-like humanoids who typically come from a simple tribal society.

<span style="font-weight:bold">Aartuk: </span>Spelljammer MC I, - Aartuk are multi-limbed, star-shaped vegetable creatures. They are warlike but homeless, so their tribes wander in search of conquest. A more powerful 'elder' accompanies each tribe. Align = LE, # = 5-20, HD = 2+1, Int = ave.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Aspis / Tohr-Kreen:</span> Greyhawk MC I (Aspis), MM, p.342 (Tohr-kreen) - Aspis are man-sized boll-weevil creatures with a hive mind.

<span style="font-weight:bold">Chitine:</span> MCA I, p.21 - Chitine are subterranean spider creatures that are generally humanoid in form.

<span style="font-weight:bold">Diabolus:</span> Mystaran MC, p.26 - Diaboli are from a "higher" plane, that of nightmares, and are utterly immune to normal magic.

<span style="font-weight:bold">Drake, Mystaran: </span>Mystaran MC, p.34 - From the prime Mystara, these tiny dragons are always encountered in a shape-shifted humanoid form. All varieties of drake are highly chaotic thieves by nature. Align = C(any), # = 1-4, HD = 3-5, Int = high.<br />

<span style="font-weight:bold">Giant / Ogre / Troll: </span>MM, p.132-148 (giants), p.272-275 (ogres), p.349-351 (trolls) - Giant humanoids come in vast array of races, but those visiting Sigil are more likely to be civilized than their reputation. While they may have trouble with the minikin-sized accoutrements, they are usually primes who do not immediately prey on all the smaller folk. Only a few are detailed here and DMs are encouraged to substitute their favorites for this list. Roll 1d10:<br />

<span style="font-weight:bold">Giff: </span>MM, p.150 - These militaristic hippo-shaped humanoids ply the planes in all ways, including spelljamming. They like combat, but need to trade for supplies like everyone else. Align = LN, # = 11-20, HD = 4, Int = low<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Grell:</span> MM, p.173 - Grell look like monstrous floating brains with a sharp beak and 10 sharp-ridged tentacles. They're highly intelligent, very dangerous, and view most other races as food. Align = NE, # = 1-10, HD = 5, Int = ave-exept.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Grommam: </span>Spelljammer MC - These gregarious, dextrous ape-men are often found spelljamming through the prime. Kind-hearted and class-conscious, they rarely stay long in the mean streets of the Cage. Align = LG, # = 10-40, HD = 2+1, Int = very<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Humanoids - Greater: </span>- The larger humanoids of 1+ HD (bugbears, gnolls and hobgoblins), tend to be better organized than their normal prime counterparts when visiting the Cage, as well as slightly less prone to random violence. Roll 1d10:<br />

<span style="font-weight:bold">Hutaakan:</span> Mystara MC, p.64 - These jackal-headed felinoids bear a slight resemblance to gnolls, but are far more urbane. They inhabit multiple primes, but only the well-lanned hutaakan travel to the Cage. Align = LN, # = 1-10, HD = 1+, Int = ave-very<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Keeper:</span> PSMC II, p.56 - While they look just slightly off-human, these planar mysteries are far from it. They keep to themselves unless a party has something they want. Align = LN, # = 1d4+2, HD = 4+4, Int = except.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Kenku:</span> MM, p.211 - Kenku are man-sized, humanoid birds, usually hailing from oriental lands or primes. They are great travelers and not uncommon in the Cage. Align = N, # = 2-8, HD = 2-5, Int = ave.<br />

9-10: Troglodyte - MM, p.348; Align = CE, # = 4-24, HD = 2, Int = low<br />
All these races are essentially humanoid, with lizard heads and / or other features. Most form rural societies at best, but could come from a more advanced prime world.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Loxo:</span> MM, p.76 - These semi-nomadic, elephantine humanoids trade fine art for the vast amounts of food they need to survive. They may rarely advance as wizards to quite high level. Align = N, # = 6-60, HD = 4+4, Int = low-except.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Lutum: </span>Spelljammer MC - Mudwomen appear human at first, but they are not. They're a strange variety of sentient mud and slime that takes humanoid form to travel. They're terribly greedy, always seeking to amass magic and wealth. Align = LE, # = 1-8, HD = 6, Int = except.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Mind Flayer:</span> MM, p.251 - Illithids are well described in many different sources. Only in the Cage could they get away with walking unharmed in public with their prey so near. Align = LE, # = 1-4, HD = 8+4, Int = genius<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Mongrelman:</span> MM, p.257 - The pathetic mongrelmen of the universe sometimes seek shelter from their awful lives in the Cage. Here, they're only another odd-looking species. Align = LN, # = 1-20, HD = 1-4, Int = low-ave.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Naga / Banelar:</span> MM, p.266-267 (naga), MCA I p.14 (banelar) - There are several types of human-headed snake creatures, most of whom are clever spellslingers.

<span style="font-weight:bold">Neogi:</span> MM, p.268 - These slave-trading spider creatures are prime relatives to the planar tso. They usually spelljam, but can be found raiding their planar cousins' territories as well. Align = LE, # = 1-8, HD = 5, Int = high<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Ormyrr:</span> MCA I, p.93 - The giant, snake-like Ormyrr act as bodyguards to many planars. Occasionally, groups of them will be encountered in the Cage as trying to make business connections. Align = LN, # = 1-12, HD = 7+7, Int = very<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Plasmoid:</span> Spelljammer MC - Plasmoids are giant amoeboids who travel widely across the prime and the planes. They come in a variety of forms, and several different types may be encountered in the Cage. DeGleash (Align = non-evil, # = 1-6, HD = 8, Int = ave.) and DelNorics (Align = non-good, # = 2-8, HD = 5, Int = very) are the most common.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Psurlon:</span> PSMC III, p.76 - The wormlike, psionic, astral-dwelling Psurlon frequent the Cage less often than their enemies, the Githyanki, but the can still be found in some numbers. They have a 20% chance of being accompanied by an Adept of their race. Align = LE, # = 1-4, HD = 7, Int = genius.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Rakasta:</span> Mystara MC, p.91 - These sophisticated catlike humanoids are famed for their urbanity and prowess as merchants. They're likely to be looking for something to trade for their well-made silk products. Align = N, # = 3-30, HD = 2+1, Int = very<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Reigar w/ Lakshu: </span>Spelljammer MC - The ever-boastful but powerful reigar are never without their tall, green-haired amazon bodyguards, the lakshu. They mostly spelljam, but also come to the Cage and the planes in their quest for new artistic diversions.<br />
Reigar: Align = CN, # = 1, HD = 14, Int = supra-genius<br />
Lakshu: Align = N, # = 2-20, HD = 5, Int = very<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Sahuagin:</span> MM, p.306-307 - The devils of the deep come to the Cage rarely, because of their need for water, but they do visit occasionally to check out the slave trade. Align = LE, # = 6-24, HD = 2+2, Int = high<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Skulk:</span> Greyhawk MC - While this race is normally quite shy, encounters with them are still possible in the Cage. Not all skulks on the prime have totally lost their civilization. Align = CE, # = 1-8, HD = 2, Int = ave.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Spellweaver:</span> MCA I, p.104-105 - Bizarre in the extreme, spellweavers aren't very comprehensible even to other planewalkers. What they want in the Cage is as much of a mystery of what they want on the Prime. Align = N, # = 1, HD = 10, Int = genius<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Spider, Planar:</span> Mystara MC, p.103-104 - Man-sized and intelligent, these giant spiders from the Ethereal Plane are to the phase spider what the high-clan Xill are to low-clan Xill: more intelligent, powerful, and civilized. They are undeservedly given a wide berth by cagers. They have a complex, advanced society, and can be quite voluble, if one can figure out how to speak with them. Align = any, # = 3-18, HD = 5-12, Int = very<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Sprite:</span> Sprites can rarely be found traveling through the Cage to reach some other sylvan area, such as a hospitable elemental plane. They're uniformly uncomfortable in the urban grime of the Cage, and never stay long. Roll 1d10:<br />

<span style="font-weight:bold">Tabi:</span> Mystara MC, p.110 - Small and monkeylike, Tabi normally are fairly primitive creatures. But their insatiable hunger for rumors and legends draws them to the Cage like moths to the flame, so they can be found here regularly. Align = CN, # = 1-4, HD = 5, Int = ave.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Tako:</span> MM, p.336 - These odd octopoids have great difficulty getting around in the Cage. But their communal nature compels them to associate with other races, so they visit it nevertheless. Align = LN, # = 3-12, HD = 4, Int = ave.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Tatalla:</span> MCA I, p.108 - The tight familial groups of tatalla, almost universally known as vicious, one-eyed assassins, (along with their tiny size) makes them easy to spot. An encounter will be with 1-4 tatalla (Align = LE, HD = 2+2, Int = ave.), but more will definitely be watching from nearby.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Tlincalli / Rastipede:</span> MM, p.245 (tlincalli, aka manscorpion), Spelljammer MC (rastipede) - Both these insectivorid centaur races are rare in the Cage. Manscoprions simply are not very numerous, while rastipedes usually spelljam across the crystal spheres of the Prime. But they can both be found here on occasion.<br />
Manscorpion: Align = NE, # = 8+, HD = 8-12, Int = low-genius<br />
Rastipede: Align = N, # = 1-6, HD = 5, Int = very<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Yuan-Ti:</span> MM, p.369 - These mutated snake-men are sometimes mistaken for lizard-kin, but they are not. They are frighteningly intelligent, dangerous, and not to be trifled with. Align = CE, # = 1-4, HD = 6-9, Int = genius</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Wow, that's a great place to start, thanks! </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>Palomides</em> wrote:</div>You might want to break it down into categories. I would suggest three categories: general/common, specific and weird</p>

<p>For example, some "general/common" things can happen just about anywhere (vendor tries to get your attention, kid comes up and begs for a copper, etc.)<br />
Other things only happen in specific neighborhoods. In The Lady's Ward, Harmonium patrols would be a semi-common occurance. Not so much in the Hive<br />
Finally, there should be a smaller chance for something really outlandish which I've lumped under "weird"</p>

<p>Do you want ideas for all of these types? Do you want combat AND non-combat ones?<br />
</div></p>

<p>Encounter subtables by ward is how I'm organizing things, yeah. For classed NPC encounters, I'm working on adventurer/mercenary/clueless, cirminal, faction/sect, lawman, rabble, and upper crust npc subtables. Now thinking a fiendish and perhaps other exemplar subtable might be justified too. </p>

<p>Thanks for those encounter suggestions. These will all be of use.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Oh, I found this other chart I made.</p>

<p>The racial encounter table would be something like this, on a d20:</p>

<p>1-8: Humanoids and planetouched<br />
9-12: Animals and pests<br />
13: Monsters<br />
14: Undead<br />
15: Fiends<br />
16: Celestials<br />
17: Cordants<br />
18-19: Elementals<br />
20: Exotic Sentients</p>

<p>First, humanoids and planetouched:</p>

<p>Most common: Humans, the default planewalking humanoid. Humans often mate with other species, but any single hybrid race is going to be somewhat rare.</p>

<p>Planetouched: Aasimar, tiefling, chaond, tuladhara, zenythri/mechanatrix, shyft, shadowswyft, gloaming, phoera, genasi, mephling, feytouched, krinth, etc.</p>

<p>Other common races: Githzerai, githyanki, bariaur, khaasta, nathri, shad</p>

<p>Rare races: Buommans, elves, dwarves, fensir, gnomes, halflings, illumians, neraphim, orcs, spikers, wildrens, spellscales, mongrelfolk, half-orcs, goblins, kobolds and xill.</p>

<p>Very rare races: Bladelings, dromites, duergar, elans, half-giants, thri-kreen, kenku, maenads, mongrelfolk, xephs, changelings, nezumi, korobokuru, spirit folk, vanara, shifters, kalashtar, inspired, warforged, goliaths, aarakocras, raptorans, catfolk, lupins, diaboli, killorens, centaurs, gnolls, dopplegangers, half-ogres, underfolk, sharakim, sea-kin, dragonborn, half-dragons, azurins, dusklings, rilkans, skarns.</p>

<p>Animals and pests include things like pigeons, large gray "executioner ravens," rot grub swarms, humanoid immigrants from the Material Plane who have degenerated to an animal state due to the stress of their new environment, two-headed Aoskian hounds, Arcadian ponies, cranium rat swarms, giant rats, moon rats, ash rats, elemental vermin, fhorges, bonespears, rasts, ravids. ethyks, gathras and other livestock, creatures corrupted by magical pollution, lost pets, and more. Of course, there will be animals with the fiendish, celestial, axiomatic, anarchic, vivacious, elemental, and entropic templates.</p>

<p>Undead include both creatures of the undead type and other beings who can be easily lumped in with them: wights, ghouls, zombies and skeletons created by the Dustmen faction, vampires and liches living openly or in secret, spectres, ghosts, and wraiths, devourers, visages, atropal scions, entropic reapers, brains in jars, bhuts, allips, hooded pupils, grimweirds, quth-maren, alhoons, cursts, necropolitans, eyes of fear and flame, living creatures who are somehow half-undead, lepers and other living victims of piteous planar diseases, petitioners (lost, refugees, or here on a mission), worms that walk, rot reavers, and ordinary corpses. The authorities of Sigil don't tolerate undead who roam around killing people, but they may tolerate those who behave themselves. The other kind - pure monsters who need to be destroyed - end up in Sigil, too, of course, and cause trouble before someone finally hunts them down. Some may lurk in secret or beneath the city for years or centuries.</p>

<p>Celestials include angels, archons, eladrins, lillends, guardinals, moon dogs, couatls, quesar, ki-rin, opinicuses, hollyphants, lammasu, phoenixes, aleaxes, and risen fiends.</p>

<p>Fiends include night hags, yugoloths, rakshasas, fallen celestials, baatezu, tanar'ri, demodands, marrashi, imps, retrievers, barghests, kytons, and kythons.</p>

<p>Cordants include slaadi, formians, modrons, inevitables, Limbo stalkers, concordant killers, justicators, rilmani, visilights, and maugs.</p>

<p>Elementals include elementals, paraelementals, genies, lumi, sylphs, grues, azers, salamanders, xorns, tsnng, and so on.</p>

<p>Exotic sentients include things like spellweavers, illithids, beholders, grell, tsochar, psurlons, witchknives, cloakers, nagas, yuan-ti, neogi, neh-thalggu, zodars, skindancers, ethergaunts, shadar-kai, nerras, kaorti, zerns, phasms, nilshai, daelkyr, protean scourges, keepers, and other beings who don't easily fit any other catagory.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>In case anyone cares, I've been beating the kinks out of an auto-roller using the tables above... Occasionally, it still rolls completely stupid things (Lantern Archon Jinkskirt?), but the more I see what it's thinking, the better I can correct it.</p>

<p>It does <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> roll stats. Just a list of 1-20 random creatures on the street, based on what ward you say you're in. <span style="font-style:italic">Most</span> of what it comes up with will be non-hostile -- unfriendly, perhaps, but generally well-behaved NPCs. I'll be adding an option for 'throw something nasty at me', at some point in the near future, but for right now, it does a pretty good impression of the average crowd on the street.</p>

<p>If you see random green code-garbage, that just means I'm debugging something. It'll go away as soon as I figure out what I broke... again... *grins*</p>
