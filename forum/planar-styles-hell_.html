        <div class="dice_rolls">
</div> <p>Forward:  Personally, I like the idea that the planes use tech and modern equipment.  However, I also believe that, while the Exemplars use high tech weapons and toys, that they should be highly stylized. Further more, I think that each cardinal plane deserves its own particular style.  The Shotgun from Hades should not be the same as a shotgun made in Celestia or Logos.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Hell</span><br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Weapons</span><br />
As a general rule, Hell favors rifles, shotguns, RPGs, and other large weapons over handguns and pistols.<br />
<span style="font-style:italic">Lemure:</span> Lemures are usually outfited with remote controlled bomb collars, or other suicide equipement.<br />
<span style="font-style:italic">Imp:</span> Imps prefer sutibly sized sniper rifles, usually with explosive bullets to add a little extra kick.  Imp rifles almost always incorperate a serpent motif.<br />
<span style="font-style:italic">Spinnagon:</span> Spinnagons are the primary operators and directors of Lemure kamikazi squads.  They prefer shotguns moddified to fire their own spikes when pressed.<br />
<span style="font-style:italic">Barbazu:</span> Barbazu wield large, underslung shotguns in combat, making judicious use of their <span style="font-style:italic">Teleport without error</span> to get into combat range.  Barbazu shotguns are remniscient of the glaives that were once their favored weapons, having long stocks, and large, razor sharp blades protruding from above and below the gun's muzzle.  These blades allow Barbazu glaives to function just like glaives if nessiary.<br />
<span style="font-style:italic">Kytons:</span> Kytons, along with Erinyes, form the primary exeption to the rule that Devils do not wield pistols and handguns.  Kytons prefer compact weapons, valuing size and handiness over sheer firepower.<br />
<span style="font-style:italic">Bezekira:</span> Ill suited to wielding most modern weapons, Hellcats occasionally are fitted with bladed grafts to augment the damage of their claws.<br />
<span style="font-style:italic">Erinyes:</span> Erinyes, along with Kytons, form an exeption to the rule that Devils do not wield handguns or pistols.  Erinyes often dual wield SMGs or poweful pistols.<br />
<span style="font-style:italic">Osyluth:</span> Osyluth tend to carry combat rifles.  Osyluth weaponry tends to have a very Gigeresque quality, involving biomechinal shapes and bone white colorations.<br />
<span style="font-style:italic">Hamatulas:</span>  Hamatulas wield combat rifles.  Hamatula weapons always include barbs, spikes and other sharp protrusions, remniscent of the barbs that grow from the Hamatulas body.<br />
<span style="font-style:italic">Gelgulon:</span> Gelgulons favor powerful combat rifles and shotguns.  Gelgulon weapons are often modular, with individual parts incorperating ridges and fitting togethor in such a way as to create the impression of overlaping plates, much like the overlaping plates of chitin that cover the Gelgulon.<br />
<span style="font-style:italic">Cornugon:</span> Cornugons prefer to wield large grenade launchers, similar to the Brute Shot of Halo 2 fame.<br />
<span style="font-style:italic">Pit Fiend:</span> Pit Fiends arm themselves as they see fit.  Most prefer range or brute force.  Pit Fiend equipment often seems as if it has been crafted from corrupt, vile flame.  This is often precisely what it is made of.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Tech by Layer</span><br />
<span style="font-style:italic">Avernus:</span> Technology on Avernus focuses primarily on industry and weapons production.  Robotics feature heavily in the innumerable factories and production lines, and most automated systems have lemures and larva incorperated into the machinery.<br />
Computers are all military devices, capable of assimilating tactical information and communicating orders with great efficiency.<br />
<span style="font-style:italic">Dis:</span> Technology on Dis mimics the technology found in most prime cities.<br />
<span style="font-style:italic">Minaruous:</span> Technology on Minaruous is geared towards mass production of consumer goods at the lowest possible price.  This means that a great deal of production is done in massive sweatshopes and on huge assebly lines.  Technology owned by the beaurocacies is always as showy and obviosly expensive as possible.<br />
<span style="font-style:italic">Phlegatos:</span> Technology in Phlegatos is geared towards toture, vice, and temptation.<br />
<span style="font-style:italic">Stygia:</span> Technology on Stygia focuses mainly on media, especially media that is designed to influence the observers opinions and thought processes.<br />
<span style="font-style:italic">Malboge:</span> Technology on Malboge focuses on minning and resource extraction, as well as support and infrastructure.  Stainless steel and rusty iron are common components of Malboge construction.<br />
<span style="font-style:italic">Maladomini:</span> Technology on Maladomini is advanced, mainly in the fields of computers and architecture.  All media is constrolled, and survielence technology is omnipresent.<br />
<span style="font-style:italic">Cania:</span> Cania posseses the bleeding edge in almost all technological fields.<br />
<span style="font-style:italic">Nessus:</span> Nessus has what it needs.  Most technology in Nessus features a heavy biomechinal style (Check out the art of Giger to get a feel of Biomechinal).</p>       </div>

Frankly, I find much of what you are saying to be out of place.  This is a thread devoted the the stylization of Hell.</div></p>

<p>First and Foremost, I do believe you have deviated quite a bit from the true spirit of Baator - even on your piece about Modern Hell, you left out many places and various deities were not even mentioned - as if they had no influence on the modern technology that just showed up one day!  Second, where did you get your information? None of the layers of hell can be simply explained in minor (even barely philosophical) ideological taglines. I mean seriously, you say Avernus is the physical embodiment of Lawful Evil War? Where the hell did you get that idea? Did the paradox of the Garden (a site in Avernus that is slowly taking over due to growth and popularity) or Bargrivyek's realm (another area in Avernus called "The Peaceable lands" - not really peaceful, more fascist if anything... anyhow) ever cross your mind? Acheron is a plane dedicated to Lawful Evil War - not the first layer of Baator! I don't know where you got your interpretations of Baator from ( certainly not the AD&amp;D guide to Hell) and I guarentee you that none of your information that you present is in the Planes of Law or the Hellbound Box sets of Planescape. I don't really care if you made changes based upon "Urban" or D20 "Modernized" ideology that is "supposedly" present here, but you should be able to back up what you post and explain why - which you haven't. I suggest severe censure for this kind of S*** you're posting here - until you've done some research and explained why!</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;deadone&#039;</em> wrote:</div>What does it matter that other locations are going to be opposed to violence?</div></p>

<p> It does matter in regards to what kind of modernizations and so-called "modern" technology would be available in certain planes, because other planes would be opposed to allowing Hell to get its hands on certain "technology".  I said the whole "wouldn't other planes be opposed to this violence and such", because you mentioned that Hades would have shotguns as well as Mount Celestia. Why would a place of Apathy and depression have any weapons at all? The people and or petitioners of Hades wouldn't care - in fact they can't care! In fact, this would make Hades impossible to "modernize" unless you throw out the entire concept of Hades and create an entirely new plane of existence from scratch. I don't even want to get started on the Mount Celestia issue here - mainly because it isn't relevant. </p>

<p>Also, what you have posted needs a lot of work... and you are seriously confused about what each of the layers of hell represent... Hope to hear back from you!  <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/smile.png" title="Smiling" alt="Smiling" class="smiley-content"/></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Calm the hell down, Dante! We all have our own interpretations, and they're naturally going to differ.</p>

<p>Avernus is more warlike than the other layers of Baator because it's where the armies of the Blood War muster.

<p> I was implying disapproval, not anger - nor resentment. I enjoy the fact that Deadone did so much already - but I just think he/she could have done much better - and a "hell" of a lot more.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;ripvanwormer&#039;</em> wrote:</div>Avernus is more warlike than the other layers of Baator because it's where the armies of the Blood War muster.

<p>Okay, you are right - But if we are to "Modernize" Hell, we need to take into consideration all the other factors involved. I mean, even in Avernus - we're talking about Planar powers like Takhisis, Tiamat, and Bargrivyek - not just Bel! (who is in fact, not a Power, just a really powerful Devil) Also, if Planescape were to "modernize" wouldn't time have progressed to the point that the Garden might have conquered almost all of Avernus? I mean its very existence is immune to anything the Devils and their enemies can dish out, but it also keeps expanding. I just feel that generalizations of the nature of each layer of hell or any other plane is rather an unfair and poorly researched understanding of what they really are.

 I was implying disapproval, not anger - nor resentment. I enjoy the fact that Deadone did so much already - but I just think he/she could have done much better - and a "hell" of a lot more.</p>

<p>Okay, you are right - But if we are to "Modernize" Hell, we need to take into consideration all the other factors involved. I mean, even in Avernus - we're talking about Planar powers like Takhisis, Tiamat, and Bargrivyek - not just Bel! (who is in fact, not a Power, just a really powerful Devil) Also, if Planescape were to "modernize" wouldn't time have progressed to the point that the Garden might have conquered almost all of Avernus? I mean its very existence is immune to anything the Devils and their enemies can dish out, but it also keeps expanding. I just feel that generalizations of the nature of each layer of hell or any other plane is rather an unfair and poorly researched understanding of what they really are. I mean, I myself am guilty of this too, by saying Acheron is simply a Plane of Lawful Evil War - which is wrong - since there is much more to it then just that (Although, it is a place of constant wars outside that of the Blood wars). However, what I'm trying to say is that - this piece by Deadone needs more research and less generalizations.</div></p>

<p>Firstly: My stance on the importence of dieties in Hell is that they are of far lesser importence than the layer lords.  Within Avernus, Bel could step on any of the dieties you mentioned (outside of Avernus, its a bit more iffy, outside of Hell, Bel is going down).  The realms of the deities can deviate from the particular flavor of a layer/plane.  They don't really count, as far as I'm concerned.<br />
Second: I disagree that planes/layers can't be defined by thematic constants.  The first layer of Acheron is devoted to war, as is the first layer of Hell.  Individual locations, such as the Garden, are exeptions, not the rule.<br />
Fourth: As for the intrests/actions of other planar groups influencing the tech of Hell... I laugh.  Very hard.  Quite frankly, the thought of Heaven, Elysium, Arborea or any other power group being able to influence the tech of Hell is absurd.  Similarly, the thought that Hell could have an influence over the tech levels of other planes is absurd.<br />
Fifth: You asked why Hades, as the plane of Apathy, would have weapons at all.  For one thing, the 'loths.  My general point with the statement was to point out that each plane will have its own particular style, its own way of doing things.  <br />
Sixth: I freely admit I don't have access to the AD&amp;D supliments, and I go by what I have been able to find out online from people who do.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>That's a possible interpretation, but <span style="font-style:italic">Planes of Law</span> implies that Garden only exists because some power of Baator (probably the Lords of the Nine; quite possibly Bel or his predecessor) want it to exist, that it's really only a cunning trap.

<p>I like your idea of a future Avernus that's been completely overwhelmed by Garden because it's unexpected - I like it so much, in fact, that I'll say it's definitely the way I would go - but it's probably objectively the least likely possibility. I don't think it's fair to criticize someone merely for going in a different way. </p>

<p>That could be, but there's no need to place all the burden of improving it on deadone. Any one of us can post our own additions/corrections/expansions/revisions, or simply post an entirely new article. </p>

<p>That's not to say it's not right to criticize someone's work - I think that's completely proper and even expected. But we could be so much more useful, if we were so inclined.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

Actually, your both wrong. Bel is simply a pit fiend – one that the Dark Eight took a liking to and appointed. In fact, if you read the Baator supplement that came with the Planes of Law box set – then you would be aware of that fact. In fact, Bel won't even go into Draukari, realm ruled over by Kurtalmak – an intermediate deity – because “He slaughters any fiends of less then 'lesser' status” - to quote the supplement. Also, Bel is not one with Avernus, because if that were true, then none of the Lords of Nine could ever be usurped or replaced/rebelled against – because they are one with their layer. However, they can be - like how Mephistopheles overthrew the lord of the eighth, Baron Molikroth, and took the title for himself. I don't know where you both got your information, but both Tiamat – ruler of all evil dragons – and Takhisis – a greater goddess - exist on Avernus and could both wipe out Bel if they wanted. They haven't, because Bel leaves them alone – probably because he is afraid and not stupid. Also, Bel isn't even of Deity-hood, thus he is the weakest power-like being on Avernus. BTW, another flaw with this idea that Bel is one with Avernus is because Asmodeus' Constable would have no power over Bel – but in fact does. The idea that Bel and Avernus are one in the same is absurd ridiculous – one that only proves that neither of you have done your research.
<div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;deadone&#039;</em> wrote:</div>The realms of the deities can deviate from the particular flavor of a layer/plane.  They don't really count, as far as I'm concerned.</div>
Well, I think they do and that is why we're having this problem. Also, they can't deviate from layer/plane! Otherwise, we would have constant planar struggles and none of the powers would have set realms or areas, because they would be under constant change by  “roaming” powers. However, Takhisis will always be in Hell as with Tiamat, Kurtulmak, and Bargrivyek – that is their home and they have – by far- more influence on the first layer then Bel will ever have.

If planes can be defined by Thematic constants, then the very idea of Planescape is meaningless – sure they have certain aspects, but none are totally devoted to a single constant besides an Alignment basis. No, Avernus is not strictly dedicated to War! Nor is Avalas – but a lot of places in Avalas are more so dedicated to war, but not all of it! Also, the Garden is extremely important to Avernus, because the normal laws of Baator do not apply within its grounds – which makes it stick out like a sore thumb. It also says in the Planes of Law box set – that the more people who travel to the Garden, the bigger it gets. It also states that more and more people are coming to the Garden. If we are to “modernize” Hell or Planescape, wouldn't this paradise in hell - being the only refuge from Bel's armies and the Powers that exist on Avernus – be the ideal place to flee too – and because of this, the Garden would spread out. Bel, BTW, has no control over the Garden.

Actually, it isn't. The reason polar opposite planes exist is because they keep each other in check – I wouldn't be surprised if the minions of Hell were trying to get a hold of certain technology that those in the Heavens or elsewhere didn't want them to get – so they intervened.

Look, no matter what, the <span style="font-style:italic">Spiritual Grayness</span> of Hades would prevent all, besides some of the Loths on the Oinos and a few demons and devils passing through. However, overtime, even those demons and devils will begin to feel the effect of the grayness. Also, Hades would never have more weapons then Acheron – I mean, it wouldn't even have enough weapons to compare to that of what Sigil's got. In fact, in the Hellbound: the Blood War box set – Hades is barely involved! The bottom line, the association with the Blood War is strictly limited to the uppermost layer and would probably mean that technology – especially “modern”- would have no place elsewhere on the plane because of the grayness.

 Wait, you expect me to be more diplomatic – but the point of these forums are – and not limited – to criticism, opinion, and advice. I offered advice and criticism – only to find out this person lacks the resources – yet, isn't willing to ask for information or more advice? And you have the gall to tell me I should have been more diplomatic? As if! I mean, this “deadone” goes by what is available online from other people – obviously, not something he/she does often.

         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;Dante the Bard&#039;</em> wrote:</div> like how Mephistopheles overthrew the lord of the eighth, Baron Molikroth, and took the title for himself. </div></p>

<p>Morlikroth was Mephistopheles.  He pretended to have been overthrown to weed out those plotting against him.<br />
Bel could be overthrown, but not by a power or by any being that does not belong to Hell.  A fallen celestial that had embraced Baator or a Baatezu could supplant him, but a being like Kurtlmak would suffer untold agonies if they dared go against the rightful masters of Baator.  As for Kurtlmak's realm, now that doesn't count, now does it?  Godly realms arn't really part of Hell, or whatever plane they are on.<br />
As for the power that Martinet has over Bel: He has none, unless you count the ruler of the Serpent Throne for whom he acts as a voice.  Whoever sits on the Throne of Nessus has indisputable power over <span style="font-style:italic">all</span> of Hell.<br />
I will state again my position: Within their godly realms, powers are ascedent.  These realms, however, are not really part of the planes they are connected to, and exist at the mercy of the planar lords.  In this case the Baatezu and the Lord of the Nine.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;Dante the Bard&#039;</em> wrote:</div>Actually, it isn't.

<p>They got involved.  And they failed miserably in their task.  Just as the slaves of Baator tried to get involved in the modernization of Celestia.  And failed in an equally spectacular manner.  Within Hell, Celestia and the Abyss have no power.  Aborea has less than no power.  Just as Hell has how power over Celestia or the Abyss and less than no power in Aborea.<br />
The reason the planes are balanced is because each is invulnerable in their own domain and powerless elsewhere. (this is in the ultimate sense.  It may seem that Celestia has scored a victory against Baator if you take a very narrow view, but if you look at the big picture, that victory will result in a strengthening of Law and Evil in Baator.)</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;Dante the Bard</em> wrote:</div>If planes can be defined by Thematic constants, then the very idea of Planescape is meaningless – sure they have certain aspects, but none are totally devoted to a single constant besides an Alignment basis. No, Avernus is not strictly dedicated to War! Nor is Avalas – but a lot of places in Avalas are more so dedicated to war, but not all of it! Also, the Garden is extremely important to Avernus, because the normal laws of Baator do not apply within its grounds – which makes it stick out like a sore thumb. It also says in the Planes of Law box set – that the more people who travel to the Garden, the bigger it gets. It also states that more and more people are coming to the Garden. If we are to “modernize” Hell or Planescape, wouldn't this paradise in hell - being the only refuge from Bel's armies and the Powers that exist on Avernus – be the ideal place to flee too – and because of this, the Garden would spread out. Bel, BTW, has no control over the Garden.</div></p>

<p>You seem to misunderstand the idea of the Thematic Constants.  They do not mean that every little inch of the plane/layer is constrained to that idea.  It means that, if you look at it in big picture perspective, you will see the constant attached to it.  Specific locals can deviate, but the constant influences everything, if subtly.<br />
As for the Garden: It grows, and Hell seems to have no power within it.  Bel reaches out, and suddenly none may gain access or egress, as it is surrounded by an impenetrable zone that prevents all travel, even the passage of Powers.  If, for some reason, Bel is prevented from doing this, then Asmodeus reaches out from the Serpent Throne and the Garden is gone, and Martinet anounces that it never was, and no memory of it exists in Hell.</p>

While they may be able to cut off and push out a few deific realms I don't think they could do this to every realm.

<p>I agree that some powers might be about equal or slightly stronger than some of the lords.  However, I think that Asmodeus is the <span style="font-style:italic">single</span> most powerful being in Hell.  No one entity could hope to match him for sheer power.<br />
Your second point explains why the dieties residing in Hell have not been removed.  They are valuable to Hell.<br />
If the Lords of the Nine were to act in unison, no power or colition of powers could stand against them in Hell.  However, they do not work well together.  But then again, neither do the powers that reside there.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;Dante the Bard&#039;</em> wrote:</div>
Actually, your both wrong. Bel is simply a pit fiend – one that the Dark Eight took a liking to and appointed. </div></p>

<p>That's what he was originally, yes (although the coup had as much to do with Bel's own ambition and cleverness - and the aid of the Sign of One faction - as the Dark Eight's help); since then he's been draining power from his imprisoned predecessor, and now he is much more.</p>

<p>My source is Colin McComb's (who wrote the Baator book in Planes of Law) article in Dragon #223.</p>

<p>"The Lords are each set over a single layer of Baator, their presence twisting and warping their layers to be more precisely what they t hemselves embody. Thus it is  that Avernus, the first layer, is a blasted and scarred wasteland, perfect for training the armies of the baatezu in the endlesss Blood War."</p>

<p>and then later: </p>

<p>"The Lords are some of the most powerful bashers in the known cosmos. They control whole layers of a plane, which is far more than most powers can claim."</p>

<p>and then later:</p>

<p>"In a sense, the Lords <span style="font-style:italic">are</span> their layers. They have the ability to shake the land around them, to make it erupt and heave up its contents. They can see all through their layer, piercing through nearly any veil thrown up for privacy."</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>In fact, if you read the Baator supplement that came with the Planes of Law box set – then you would be aware of that fact. In fact, Bel won't even go into Draukari, realm ruled over by Kurtalmak – an intermediate deity – because “He slaughters any fiends of less then 'lesser' status” - to quote the supplement.</div></p>

<p>Yeah, I exaggerated a little for effect. A Lord of the Nine has no power over the gods in their sovereign realms. They're approximately of equal power, in fact - note the rivalry between Set and Levistus, where each is trying to defeat the other. Set is unable to topple Levistus, and Levistus is thus far unable to drive Set out of Stygia. It's said that Set's realm is shrinking, though.</p>

<p>Rumor has it that one of the Lord of the Nine forced the orcish pantheon to flee to Acheron. Perhaps Bel can't do that yet - not until he completely drains his predecessor - or perhaps he merely does not wish to.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div> Also, Bel is not one with Avernus, because if that were true, then none of the Lords of Nine could ever be usurped or replaced/rebelled against</div></p>

<p>They <span style="font-style:italic">are</span> one with their layers. However, this isn't necessarily a permanent state; all a usurper has to do is convince the layer (through show of cleverness or force) that he or she is more deserving of rulership than the existing lord. This is what Bel did with his predecessor. Still, it's a slow process fully merging himself with Avernus.</p>

<p>Again, quoting Dragon #223:</p>

<p>"The original Lord of Avernus (not Tiamat, contrary to popular belief) found herself imprisoned and entrapped by her warlord, the pit fiend Bel, thousands of years ago. She's now struggling to break free, but her struggles become weaker and weaker as Bel siphons more of the Lord's power for himself. For all intents, Bel is the new Warlord of Avernus and that suits the other Lords fine - at least, it seems to; they've not lifted a finger to aid their ensnared sister.</p>

<p>"However, because of this, Avernus has become a little fiercer, more brutal than it was under the original Lord."</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>both Tiamat – ruler of all evil dragons – and Takhisis – a greater goddess - exist on Avernus and could both wipe out Bel if they wanted.</div></p>

<p>No, they couldn't. Avernus doesn't recognize them; it recognizes Bel. He has as much control over the layer as they have over their individual realms. If he were willing to extend enough effort, perhaps with time he would be able to make the layer reject their realms completely, shunting them into Gehenna or Acheron. Or perhaps not. Regardless, neither goddess is stupid enough to try to fight one of the Lords of the Nine. He controls an infinite amount more territory than they do. He is not omnipotent on his layer, not aware of every little pebble or able to usurp the free will of travelers there, but he has an incredible amount of power, one even a deity cannot afford to take for granted.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div> Asmodeus' Constable would have no power over Bel – but in fact does.</div></p>

<p>Martinet? He's only a noble, not nearly in the league of one of the Lords of the Nine (see the hierarchy in <span style="font-style:italic">Faces of Evil: The Fiends</span>. His only power is that he represents the Dark Lord of Nessus. Bel might obey him out of fear of the Dark Lord - who has the power to replace any of the Nine - but certainly not out of fear of Martinet himself.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div> The idea that Bel and Avernus are one in the same is absurd ridiculous</div></p>

<p>Absurd ridiculous? Wouldn't the two words cancel each other out? </p>

<p>Look, Dante. Cut the attitude; it's just a game, and one where multiple viewpoints is a <span style="font-style:italic">good</span> thing. I'll wager I've read the sourcebooks as much as you have, but they're just a point of departure, not holy writ. Colin McComb and I think that Bel and the other Lords of the Nine are extremely powerful on the plane they control. You might wish to play it another way, and that's fine.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>If planes can be defined by Thematic constants, then the very idea of Planescape is meaningless</div></p>

<p>That's quite a claim. The very idea of Planescape is dependent on the idea that planar layers can't have themes? So if I say, for example, that the theme of Chronias is holy mystery, or the theme of Karasuthra is creatures of the night, or the theme of Pelion is forgotten passions, or the theme of Agathion is imprisoned madness - all that renders the entire campaign meaningless?</p>

<p>I'll agree that most layers are more complex than that, and can carry the weight of multiple themes and meanings. I won't agree that summarizing them delegitimizes the entire multiverse.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div> If we are to “modernize” Hell or Planescape, wouldn't this paradise in hell - being the only refuge from Bel's armies and the Powers that exist on Avernus – be the ideal place to flee too – and because of this, the Garden would spread out. </div></p>

<p>Maybe, if we assume that Garden isn't a baatezu plot - as it's hinted that it is - or that this plot hasn't already come to fruition. Don't forget that Avernus is infinite, so no matter how big Garden gets, it's only going to be a tiny part of the layer as a whole - assuming, that is, that it grows incrementally and doesn't suddenly swallow the layer in a quantum leap, which is possible.</p>

<p>Yes, your idea is reasonable and attractive to me, personally. No, it's not the only reasonable idea.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Bel, BTW, has no control over the Garden. </div></p>

<p>Yet. As far as we know.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Actually, it isn't. The reason polar opposite planes exist is because they keep each other in check – I wouldn't be surprised if the minions of Hell were trying to get a hold of certain technology that those in the Heavens or elsewhere didn't want them to get – so they intervened.</div></p>

<p>This seems unlikely to me. Keeping knowledge of a certain technology out of the hands of anyone who wants to get it is very hard. Once Pandora's Box has been opened, you can't close it again, as those trying to prevent small countries from getting nuclear weapons have found to their sorrow.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Also, Hades would never have more weapons then Acheron – I mean, it wouldn't even have enough weapons to compare to that of what Sigil's got. In fact, in the Hellbound: the Blood War box set – Hades is barely involved! </div></p>

<p>You should read Hellbound again, I think. The Gray Waste (or Hades, as the Clueless call it) is the site of the worst battles the Blood War has ever fought. Look at the Field of Nettles. </p>

<p>It's probably true that the misery and apathy of the Waste would prevent those who dwell there from developing advanced technologies on their own, but they don't have to. They can simply buy it from elsewhere, and the yugoloths are happy to sell weapons to just about anyone (yes, even on the two lower layers).</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div> And you have the gall to tell me I should have been more diplomatic? </div></p>

<p>Yeah, I do. Put it this way: if you're not diplomatic, others are unlikely to listen to you.</p>

<p>Feel free to post your own future version of Baator. That's probably the best you can hope for at this point.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div> I mean, this “deadone” goes by what is available online from other people</div></p>

<p>The sheer cheek of it!</p>

<p>The elitism you're expressing here isn't very productive or beneficial to the community. Not everyone is going to have the same amount of resource materials available. Those of us who have more can make suggestions/corrections, but there's no need to act as if a sin has been committed. Deadone put some effort into writing this; it's not exactly the way I would have done it, but thus far no one else has been willing to put a similar amount of effort to making their own version. If deadone doesn't want to change anything, that's fine - it's just something he's written, not an official product.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div> I was hoping that <span style="font-style:italic">deadone</span> might have offered me to add some touches to what he/she had already done.</div></p>

<p>He might have, if you had been nicer about it. I realize it seems petty that the way we say things can affect others more than what may seem like common sense, but that's human nature for you.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>*ahem*</p>

<p>Actually the point why I pushed to have these forums installed, and then rewrote the code to make the forums more adaptable to our needs - was to create and encourage a *community*. I didn't provide the toy for folks to smack each other over the head with, folks - its there to encourage you to talk, to create, to debate - and *most of all* to make friends. <br />
Which is what I'd suggest doing - making friends.</p>

<p>What rip is pointing out is that the form of critism that you are using is coming over as extremely negative as opposed to constructive (which I'm sure is what you were probably aiming for). The reason that constructive critism is more acceptable is because it simply *works* better. It's much easier to get someone to do something for you with a smile and a 'please' - than by whipping them over the head and telling them they and their work are worthless scum. Intended or not - that's the impression you've been giving, so understanably you got a defensive reaction. You'd have the same reaction if someone critiqued your work the same way, too.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">
