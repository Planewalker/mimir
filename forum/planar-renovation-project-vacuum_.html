</div> <p>Okay, the plane of Quasielemental Vacuum can be pretty much described as "Nothing". It isn't the all-consuming black-hole void of the Negative, it isn't the infinite void of the unknown like the transitive planes, it isn't even the outer space void of the phlogstion and wildspace. It is just nothingness. The only interesting thing there is the Doomguard's fortress. There are mentions of strange creatures without substance made of pure thought which makes me curious, but the few creatures there don't really seem to be them. Sun Sing appears to be the guy running this place, but nothing is really known about him other than his involvement with the obyriths. I believe this is the place most in need of a renovation.</p>       </div>

--Aleister Crowley, The Book of Lies<br />
*********************************************************************</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">A short history</span></p>

<p>No. Just, no. Enough with the "vacuum is air, infused with negative energy" nonsense. It's people like you who've set the science of alchemy back hundreds of years. </p>

<p>As I've told you probably a thousand times now, you can't deduce the atomic structure of substances from the structure of the Inner Planes. Oh, sure, sometimes it works. Ooze is certainly a mixture of earth and water. Magma is earth mixed with fire atoms. But just as often, it isn't. Common dust is a result of earth atoms mixed with enough air atoms to prevent them from packing. Steam is water bonded to fire. Smoke is obviously not fire mixed with air; we can see the pure fire <span style="font-style:italic">released</span> during any burning. Smoke is, instead, a form of air released by the process of burning, bonded to ash. </p>

<p>But I digress. The point is, the current configuration of the Inner Planes isn't a cosmic reflection of alchemy. It's the result of eons of slow churning and planar cataclysms giving us in a present state that's more or less arbitrary. In the histories of the City of Brass there are references to ancient wars and genocides that correlate with the changes of climate on the Material Plane witnessed in fossil records. The shape of the elemental planes is <span style="font-style:italic">dynamic</span>, and the current shape is relatively recent.</p>

<p>As best as we can tell from the records we have access to, what is now known as the Quasielemental Plane of Vacuum was once found in the exact <span style="font-style:italic">center</span> of the elemental rings. In the cosmology of Rokugan, it is believed that Void is an element as important as Fire, Earth, and Water. And the thing is, the deep planar histories all suggest they're right. Vacuum as a <span style="font-style:italic">substance</span>, the default and most common substance in the cosmos, the very substance of space-time, has no particular negative energy leanings. The mystics of Rokugan believe that Void was the first of all elements, and the other elements sprung forth from Void. And all indications are that they're right. At some point in the eons since, perhaps coinciding with the invasion of the prehistoric hordes of Chaos, there was a surge in power from the Negative Energy Plane that dragged several other planes toward it, including Vacuum, Ash, Salt, and Dust. In fact, I don't think there <span style="font-style:italic">were</span> any "negative quasielemental planes" before that point, or any "quasielemental planes" at all. Natural substances have no inherent inclinations toward life or death, after all; radiance isn't more "alive" than fire any more than common salt is "dead." The energy planes were quite separate from the elemental planes, but something in the distant past changed that, sucking plane after plane toward the terrible, hungry maw at the bottom of the multiverse and initiating the tug of war between Positive and Negative planes that continues to this day.</p>

<p>Vacuum is the plane of absolute nothingness, right? It's the Lack, and the End of all that Is. So why isn't it absolutely cold there? Isn't Cold the Lack of Heat?</p>

<p>Well, berky-berk, you don't understand the Inner Planes yet!</p>

<p>See, in the Inner Planes (if not everywhere), both warmth and cold are substances, just like the elements. Cold is a characteristic of the paraelement of Ice, just as Heat is a characteristic of Fire (or, some say, Magma). In the End (that's what bloods call Vacuum: the End) neither substance exists; all that remains is a lukewarm Nothing, with neither sensation detectable. What about the plane of Ash, you ask? Isn't that plane cold because all the fire's gone?</p>

<p>Tsk, tsk. So much to learn.</p>

<p>The plane of Ash is cold because it actively drains, and extinguishes, Fire. It has nothing to do with Cold: it's just anti-warmth, the negative equivalent of Hotness. The negative energy plane's neither hot nor cold, just as the positive plane isn't; one thing a frost salamander and a flame salamander can agree on is that temperature's got nothing to do with life and death.</p>

<p>What does this mean for Ice? Is there a negative Ice, a plane of Melting that drains Cold as much as Ash drains Heat?</p>

<p>What are you asking me for, berky-berk? Do I look like I know everything?</p>

<p>-- Sklar Rohan, an obnoxious planewalker.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Gnarltang, the Fire Without Heat</span></p>

<p>Vacuum is the Lack. While the Inner Planes are accused by some of being the source of all things, Vacuum seems to be the source of nothing, the place where the lack of things comes from.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Gnarltang</span> is the Lack of Heat. It resembles a vast field of flame, like something a body might encounter on the Plane of Fire, but it emits no heat. Unlike Coldfire in Ash, it emits no cold either. It's very peculiar; Fire Without Heat isn't a substance that gets used much anywhere, though I can think of some good applications for it. Why does a substance that isn't used need a source? That's one of the great mysteries of the Inner Planes.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Krikow</span>, the Ice Without Cold, is another such realm. Vast fields of Ice rise out of the void, all as lukewarm as the plane itself. Nothing lives here, and can kill you.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Rashagon</span>, the fields of nothing, are hollow reeds stretching off into infinity. Why Vacuum needs to knit itself into a semblance of substance is a mystery; apparantly specific lacks do need a source, and this is it. Rashagon is the Lack of Land. The reeds grow from nothing, drink nothing, and give nothing. Perhaps this was a demiplane that Vacuum swallowed.<br />
This realm is free of egarus. No one knows why.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Xovjq</span>, the forest without substance, is more of the same. Are you seeing a pattern here? Xovjq has trees, animals, and even villages, but no solidity. It's a nice place for those used to something to rest in, but the realm is entirely intangible, and in fact isn't there. Most blame a god for the creation of this place, and void quasielementals occasionally come to the edges of Xovjq to chant and try and call the demiurge back. Thus far, there has been a depressing lack of response, so the spirits are stuck with the area for now.</p>

<p>The dark of Xovjq is that, as we said earlier, it doesn't exist. The quasielementals are in fact worrying over nothing. This may seem strange to the inhabitants of other planes, but it's hard for a nonnative to understand just how important nothing really is to a vacuum quasielemental. In the End, nothing is all there is to worry about; if you were smart, you'd worry about it too.</p>

<p>Tarvis Lacklife, who neither lives nor dies, isn't alive, and as you might have guessed isn't dead either. He is a quasielemental who personifies the Lack of both. Don't misunderstand, he's not undead -- that's a state of being, and there is no Being here if the plane has anything to say about it. If you meet him, you'll see what I mean. He resembles whatever race views him, but he's not rotting, his heart isn't beating, he isn't breathing, no gases escape his not-carcass, but his physical form is clearly flesh. It's possible to destroy this form, but the quasielemental spirit always forms another one, out of pure nothingness, apparantly just in case someone on the Prime should need something that neither lives nor dies. </p>

<p>Tarvis's goals are simple: he has none. However, he seems to be attracted to large groups of the living or dead, and has been spotted in cities on neighboring planes. </p>

<p>Not all of the plane of Vacuum is of a piece. Meddlesome gods have on occasion changed even this place of nothingness. The Aluvian goddess Aelenta, one of four patrons of the winds and seasons, has chosen the End for her centre of power.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Aelenta</span><br />
the childless mother, the widow, the end of the year, the end of growth, and the west wind<br />
Lesser Power, "the Mourner, the Bountiful"<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">AoC:</span> Autumn, West Wind, Harvest, Brewing	<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Alignment:</span> Chaotic good<br />

<span style="font-weight:bold">Symbol:</span> broken grain plant	<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Home P/R:</span> Plane of Vacuum/the Gathering (Heart's Void)	</p>

<p>The youngest of the seasons, Aelenta was the wife of Landron of the Inner Light (Him Who Knows), the god who gave order to the wind and seasons and sometime leader of the Aluvian pantheon until he was overthrown by his son, Anamod. No longer burdened with the responsibilities of ruling, Landron settled down with his wife, the beloved goddess of the harvest, and made the most of his lesser role, structuring his part of the cosmic plan. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, Landron's order conflicted with the glory of the quarrelsome god Daemonus, who ended up killing the Inner Light and carrying off Aelenta. Aelenta insisted on serving dinner to her kidnapper, and she magically increased the potency of his mead enough to put him in a deep sleep. She was rescued by her brother Frigus, god of winter, who locked Daemonus away in an icy prison. </p>

<p>Aelenta is said to have stopped all plants from ripening until her older sister Gilanta, goddess of spring, intervened, luring her out of her cave with an erotic/ridiculous dance.</p>

<p>Aelenta is portrayed as a mature, bosomy woman with bright yellow hair, wearing a crown of corn ears. Known as the Bountiful, she is now also known as the Mourner, and the time of dying leaves is seen also as a period of sadness. The void around her realm which before only acted as an attractant, drawing the ripeness from the harvest, now reflects the emptiness of her heart. As her home plane aligns with Aluvia's northern hemisphere, the weather grows chill. The Gathering is a part of the emptyness filled with leaves and fruit siphoned from the Prime Material.</p>

<p>She is served by elementals of air and vacuum, and vultures. As goddess of brewing, she presides over the liver. Her bird is the vulture, and she is a protector of the dead.</p>

<p>In Aelenta's realm, two things distinguish it from the rest of the End. A chill appears in the nothing, first unnoticable but eventually extremely chill as the plane moves toward Ash. Dry leaves spiral about in vast quantities, along with stacks of ripe grain.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Gods of nothing</span></p>

<p>Gods of nothing, demipowers at best, these entities aren't widely worshipped by anything. They lurk in the emptiness of quasielemental Vacuum as if embarassed to live in a plane with a population, and to most are nothing but names in the sorts of overcomplicated theologies favored by monks without enough to keep them busy.</p>

<p>Eenus, The God Who Isn't There<br />
Meenus, The God Who Might Be There<br />
Minus, The God Who Never Was<br />
Mough, The Vanishing God<br />
Plakesh, The Bringer of Nothing<br />
Saeno, The Goddess of Abstinence<br />
Dryva, The Mother of No One<br />
Culuan, God of No Feelings (Anesthesia)<br />
The King of Nowhere<br />
No One's Child<br />
Shedo, The Lack of Future<br />
Prezius, The Lack of Wealth (not poverty)<br />
Nokob, The God of No Magic</p>

<p>The dark of these gods is that they're starting to stir. It seems they have a project in mind, the creation of an entire nonexistent world on the material plane. They will carefully and lovingly not bring it into existence, and laborously not create millions of worshippers to help them grow in power. Yet power they will get, power to create other such worlds, even where more conventional worlds exist now...</p>

          Re: Planar Renovation Project: Vacuum        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>For thread collection purposes, I'll reiterate here the suggestion I made on the original request thread.</p>

<p>A fairly wholesale "renovation" would be to reject Vacuum as a plane entirely.  After all, why should negative Air be nothingness?  Why isn't that true for all the rest of the elements? Instead, move Vacuum to be a region in each of the negative quasielemental planes.  For each of the four, it becomes the region of absolute zero nothingness just before the Multiverse goes, horribly, incomprehensibly <span style="font-style:italic">past</span> nothing and in to the anti-existence of the Negative. Allow the Vacuum creatures like egarus to live in all of these regions, which are connected with lots of planar paths which might even be useful, if dangerous, for travelers.  After all, elementally speaking, how could you even tell when you had gone from one a vacuum of one element to a vacuum of another?</p>

<p>This requires changes to the nearby planar arrangement.  Replace Vacuum with Smoke as the negative Air quasielemental. The theme of Smoke becomes devitalization.  As you head Negative from Air, breathing becomes harder. The air becomes polluted and stale. The glow that suffuses the Plane of Air slowly fades, and visibility is limited. In core Smoke there's plenty of air, but it doesn't support any creature that has to breathe. Going further Negative, the air pressure itself starts decreasing toward zero.</p>

<p>Replace Smoke with Lightning as the Fire/Air paraelemental. Replace Lightning as the positive Air quasielemental with the Plane of Thunder. (Note: there canonically <span style="font-style:italic">is</span> a lot of thunder on the Plane of Lightning, it's just that this sonic-oriented plane would skip the lightning, and be even louder.)  You might want to reshuffle some creatures' powers and resistances to reflect this.  If you leave various powers and resistances alone, everything is fine, though efreet might mock djinn about their affinities lying with a lesser paraelement. If you replace most resistances to electricity with resistances to sonic attacks, and a lot of electric powers with sonic, thing might get a little complicated but hopefully wouldn't be too much out of balance. Air being opposed to Earth, sonic effects as positive Air make a lot of sense -- sonic attacks like <span style="font-style:italic">shatter</span> damage crystalline beings, which takes direct aim at mineral creatures.</p>

<p>The Plane of Thunder would be something like this:</p>

<p>Going Positive from Air, the winds get more active, until you come to a plane where hurricanes and tornados rip across the endless sky. Whipcrack wavefronts of sonic booms hurtle invisibly from one part of the plane to another, sometimes expoding outward from a point for no visible reason, sometimes banging together or even collapsing inward on a brief moment of intense pressure that creates <span style="font-style:italic">sonic jewels</span>, air crystallized in the form of a sound node. Endless thunder shakes the atoms of everything in the plane; all objects not protected against sonic damage suffer 1d10-1 points per round, and living creatures with less than 5 points of sonic resistance must make Fort saves against deafness.</p>

<p>In addition to gyre mephits (from dust devils up to tornados) and invisible sound quasielementals, living songs roam the plane, which adventurous bards seek for magical effects, some paying with their hearing. There are places here where you can hear anything you want to hear, and you will. Floating effects of <span style="font-style:italic">holy word</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">blasphemy</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">dictum</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">word of chaos</span> drown out the other effects of the plane and are inhabited by beings of alignments that find them comfortable. Words equal in power but having nothing to do with alignments have been discovered here, like <span style="font-style:italic">word of ransom</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">nickname</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">bon mot</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">mot juste</span>. Ecumenical outposts of a surprising variety of religions feature mystics who believe that within the sound of the Thousand Thunders one can hear the voice that spoke Creation, or the words that Reality is telling us now, or the secret knowledge that makes gods.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Jem- your suggestion probably goes well beyond a "renovation"; but nonetheless, I liked it. <br />
I've always found the placement of the elemental planes somewhat arbitrary and often non-sensical; which is why I have a preference for the 4e elemental chaos. </p>

<p>But  regardless of its placement, I think the bigger question is how does one populate a void? I think Vanwormer is on the right track (and I think his(?) ideas would fit in even if you moved the location of the plane as you mentioned)</p>

<p>Personally, I think it would be fun to make this the home of nascent gods who seek to create something out of nothing. The plane is pocketed with tiny domains created from the stray thought of these not-fully-congealed gods/concepts. The tiny "domains" that form are either successful and wander off to be true demiplanes or find places to reside in the existing planes; or these self-create "domains" get swallowed back into the Void.<br />
This could allow for a lot of odd-ball ideas. Sure the really odd ones will be eventually doomed to be swallowed back into nothingnessl but they could still provide some interesting places to visit while they still survive</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

          Dreamless Rest        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><span style="font-style:italic">To sleep...</span><br />
<span style="font-style:italic">                                ...perchance to dream.</span><br />
<span style="font-style:italic">Aye, there's the rub.  For in that sleep of death, what dreams?</span></p>

<p>This region of Vacuum is the Void in its aspect of deepest, dreamless sleep.  Mortals (anyone who needs to sleep) who enter the place find that their bodily functions slow until they no longer need even to breathe.  A Will or Fort save every round (use the character's better) is required against a DC that starts at 10 and increases by 1 for every round spent within Dreamless Rest; failure means the character falls asleep.  Beings that do not sleep or are naturally immune to magical sleep effects are unaffected -- though they will need to breathe.</p>

<p>Sleep in this place is a comfort to those afflicted with insanity, nightmares, or other mental troubles.  Even dreams are muted here, and it is not possible to enter the Ethereal or summon creatures from the Ethereal from within these boundaries.  Natural healing is very slow, just a single hit point a day, and it takes a week to move up a bodily tiredness level (exhausted to fatigued, fatigued to rested) but creatures have negligible need for food and water and can remain here for long periods in near-stasis.  Doing so can provide new saving throws against ongoing mental afflictions, so a small group of elvish healers in Sigil has been using the place, located just recently, in an attempt to cure Pandemonium's wind-madness.  Patients who have been woken up may indeed have regressed through some of the stages, but testing is still in progress.  It's also necessary to protect the sleeping patients, for which they've been hiring elves and a few other unsleeping swordarms.  Some of the more virulently insane patients have disappeared, and the docs aren't sure how, or even if the berks are still alive somewhere.</p>

<p>DM's dark: <div class="spoiler"><div class="spoiler-warning"><span>Spoiler:</span> Highlight to view</div><div class="spoiler-content">Dreamless Rest works fine as advertised, but it is in fact a void creature itself.  It eats the dreams it induces.  So far, it has been accepting quantity over quality, but the influx of nightmare and madness doesn't taste as good as sane peoples' dreams, and the elves and warforged guards are uncomfortable indigestible chunks in its maw.  It's capable of ejecting interlopers or sleepers violently, exposing them to the effects of the plane, and it did this to some particularly unpleasant barmies.  It might be possible to negotiate with it telepathically to feed it some normal, sane dreams on a rotating basis of sleepers, to dilute the bitterness of the nightmares.</div></div></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>^^The place of dreams has already been established to occur on the Ethereal Plane.  It makes absolutely no sense for it to appear on Vaccum, unless you think that the inhabitants of earth-dominant inner planes don't dream?</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">After all, why should negative Air be nothingness?</span></p>

<p>That's not precisely what it is.  Vacuum is just that-- black holes, vacuums, devouring of matter and energy, personified. </p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Why isn't that true for all the rest of the elements?</span><br />
It's true for 2 of the three other negative quasielemental planes.  Vacuum is not nothingness, however, it's a LACK or decay.</p>

<p>Ash= decay of energy<br />
Dust= decay of matter<br />
Vacuum= annihilation of both (though not decay, persay)</p>

<p>Vacuum is the lack of breathable air, at its most base.  </p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">But regardless of its placement, I think the bigger question is how does one populate a void?</span></p>

<p>Seems to come easiest to incorporeal undead.</p>

<p>I REALLY like your ideas, BTW, Rip.  I'd place Krikow on the border between Core Vacuum and the Frigid Void (subregion bet. Core Ice and Core Vacuum)  Gnarltang could likewise be placed at the junction between the borders of the Ash/Vacuum subregion and Core Vacuum.</p>

<p>Oh, yeah, one thing I should bring up: I'm toying with the idea that WHILE ALL NEGATIVE QUASIELEMENTALS ARE ALIVE (unless they're necromentals), some possess positive energy as their animus (or lifeforce, or animating spirit, or whatever you want to call it), while others possess negative energy as their animus.  There are also 'subspecies' among these two 'subspecies' that can easily convert the opposite of their animus to the same as their animus-- these are the ones that live in many of the border regions in the negative quasiplanes, including their cores.  Wars between the positive and negative animus quasielementals erupt frequently, as both sides see complete dominance over their native plane.  <br />
To the minority of quasielementals able to exist comfortrably in both negative and mildly positive environments, the two sides hold little meaning, so the majority are neutral, though a considerable number have chosen sides, and do not always ally with those of the same animus, even though doing such a thing invites vicious retaliation from both groups.<br />
Just as not all positive-energy anima belong to living creatures (as there are mummies and deathless, after all), not all negative-energy anima belong to undead.  Though generally, only living creatures native to a negative quasielemental plane or the negative energy plane itself possess a negative animus.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Hazzarath, the Dying Winds</span><br />
And in the darkness of the Plane of Void glows a shimmering cloud of gas, lit by rare flashes of lightning from dying storms and by flickering torches from the seemingly endless, mostly abandoned palace of Hazzarath, last home of a house of noble djinn whose name has been stricken from all records. The Void Caliph, his skin a blue so dark it is almost black, is one of the last surviving members of the house; some of the others have voluntarily imprisoned themselves in bottles to stop the slow fading, the long dwindling of powers their family has experienced since their banishment or self-exile to the Quasielemental Plane of Vacuum. The Caliph still carries himself with regal dignity, but it's clear his wishes no longer accomplish what they once could. Every year the lights of Hazzarath grow dimmer, and the vacuum quasielementals' offer of final oblivion grows more enticing. In the meantime, he offers a certain amount of hospitality in the emptiness, although the temptation to betray his guests to the void elementals in exchange for a few more years respite may be overwhelming. </p>

<p>This is where the Elemental Plane of Air goes to die, spiraling mists, clouds, and winds leaking from a vortex and dissipating into nothing. Air elementals trapped on this side of the vortex howl in despair; for them, there is no return, no possible destiny other than death or transformation to vacuum quasielementals. Races that were enemies on the Elemental Plane of Air, like the anemos and eolians, may become strange bedfellows in the Land of Dying Winds, or they may become entirely bent on mutual destruction.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Waste of Breath</span> is a small town inhabited by <a href="http://users.erols.com/aburner/planescape/vacuum2.html" class="bb-url">vacuum genasi</a> descended from the exiled djinn of Hazzarath. For whatever reason, true air genasi can't be born on this plane; only gaunt, silent genasi of the void. For vacuum genasi, this group gets a lot of exposure to outsiders, but almost all of it is hostile or derisive. They've taken the name "Waste of Breath" to heart and are almost all convinced that their conception was a terrible mistake and their very existence weakens the sorrowful air elementals they're surrounded by. Suicide is the most common destiny for those who aren't murdered by ragewinds, but somehow they've kept reproducing enough to survive as a community for many generations. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">The Ending Story</span><br />
Once a beautiful fey demiplane, the Ending Story is now a cloud of rocks and wood, disintegrating in the void. Exactly how the demiplane managed to steer itself into the Quasielemental Plane of Vacuum isn't clear; some references on other planes suggest a cyclical baptism in nothingness followed by a time of rejuvenation and new life. Something went wrong, apparently, because almost all the demiplane's life is gone, now. A single shining tower on a chunk of floating earth remains, inhabited by a single childlike ruler, who slowly dies for lack of a name. Not just any name will serve; it must be one of the Fey Names of Power, carried down the generation from the time of dawn, when the le'Shay created the first faerie realms. The childlike creature lost her old name, swallowed by the void, and a new one must be had or her story will never again be told.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Terminish, the End of All Things</span><br />
Four different vortexes spiral together in this spot in a cloud of air, dust, salt, and ash, four shimmering spirals meeting together and vanishing into darkness. Visitors from the planes of Air, Ash, Dust, and Salt take advantage of this rare planar juncture to meet, war, and trade. Bridges stretch between elemental rivers and meet at stable, sheltered marketplaces (looking more like fortresses from outside) where exotic goods, often forbidden on their respective planes, can be had for a price. While the vortex to Hazzarath is one-way, in Terminish it's possible to travel back, with difficulty. In the center of the four rivers is a natural phenomenon similar to an <span style="font-style:italic">orb of annihilation</span>, swallowing the elemental substance completely. While some worry that the orb must be an indication that the Negative Energy Plane must have expanded to this point at some time in the past and might swell over the site again, this has not happened in centuries.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">The Hollow Men</span><br />
According to their own myths, the Hollow Men were brought to the Plane of Void by the djinn of Hazzarath, and they are among the ancestors of the vacuum genasi of Waste of Breath.  Once they were human, but like their djinni masters they have dwindled. While the void djinn grew weaker in magic and midnight-blue, the Hollow Men transformed physically, literally hollowing out. Their eye sockets are empty, as are their mouths. To all appearances, they are hollow sacks of skin. Some of them only exist from the front, becoming invisible if seen from the back. Others are reverse, and can only be seen from the front. They are pitiful creatures, for the most part, acting as servants to the remaining djinn or as sad figures on the outskirts of other settlements. The danger they present is those who remain among them for too long slowly change like they have, losing substance until they become hollow beings who can only remain alive on a plane where nothingness is substance and emptiness is the truest reality. A few manage to exist in Sigil, especially near the city's edge, close to the paradoxical nonexistence created by the Spire nullifying matter, energy, thought, time, and entropy beyond. Sometimes dwelling in buildings that only exist on one side, the Hollow Men of Sigil live tenuous half-existences on the border of a city as impossible as they are.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">The Nowhere Men</span><br />
While the Hollow Men are pitiful, the Nowhere Men are terrifying. They come from literally nowhere, creations of the infinite emptiness who manifest in islands of substance, determined to return all substance to the oblivion from which they emerged. They resemble sleek and beautiful humans, dressed all in black with eyes filled with seething darkness. Some act as tempters and seducers, convincing their victims to willingly surrender themselves to nonexistence, while others are kidnappers and thugs. They worship spirits of the void or <span style="font-style:italic">orbs of annihilation</span> such as the one at the center of the End of All Things, feeding their victims to those eternally hungry maws.</p>

<span style="font-weight:bold">Spiritual correspondences:</span> Xenophobia, nothingness, lack.<br />

<p>I'd add gluttony or hunger to that list, since Vacuum also embodies sucking from black holes and the like.  So I'd add hunger-related behavioral patterns to the vacuum quasielementals.  Hunger for knowledge, hunger for power, hunger for the breath of the living (a delicacy in Vacuum, I'm sure), hunger for matter/etc to suck, etc.</p>

<p>Also, I'd say that many air elementals who get too close to Vacuum become Voidwraiths (type of undead elemental from Libris Mortis), while others become 'nilla necromentals.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>My air genasi wizard had a whole list of vacuum spells I was going to have him researching as character color, until I realized that as equipment went, new spells that were balanced against other spells weren't much of an investment of several thousand gp.  However, I still have the list, so here you go!</p>

<p>(This list hasn't been playtested, so buyer beware.)</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Devitalize Air</span><br />
Transmutation<br />
Level: Sor/Wiz 5, Drd 6<br />
Components: V, S, M<br />
Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)<br />
Effect: 20-ft. radius spherical or hemispherical region of atmosphere<br />
Duration: Instantaneous; see text<br />
Saving Throw: special; suffocation check<br />
Spell Resistance: No</p>

<p>You cause a volume of atmosphere in a 20-foot radius to become incapable of supporting life.  Nonmagical flames in the area immediately die.  A successful Spellcraft check to identify this spell allows someone to warn comrades in time to hold their breath.  (If this spell is just being introduced to the campaign, this Spellcraft check may be impossible, or unusually difficult.)</p>

<p>Air-breathing creatures who do not have the benefit of such forewarning within the area of effect must make Constitution checks as if for suffocation, with the DC starting at the DC of your spell.  Creatures who leave the affected area before falling unconscious are unharmed; a creature who exits the area immediately during their next turn after this spell is cast suffers no effect.</p>

<p>Plants are not affected by this spell unless the caster wishes to affect plants; they may choose to affect only plants (and not fires), or may increase the spell's level by 1 and affect both plants and regular air-breathing creatures (and fires).  Few casters realize this flaw and option exist!</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Purify air</span> counters and dispels devitalize air.  A strong wind will reduce the radius of effect to 10 feet in one round and disperse the effect in two; outside, the effect disperses in 10 minutes even on a calm day.  In a confined space, such as underground, the devitalized air may last a long time.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Arcane material component:</span> A sealed vial in which a flame used up the oxygen.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Inhale</span><br />
Abjuration<br />
Level: Sor 3, Wiz 4<br />
Components: S<br />
Casting Time: immediate action<br />
Range: personal<br />
Duration: 1 round<br />
Saving Throw: None<br />
Spell Resistance: No</p>

<p>As an immediate action, upon being attacked by a breath weapon or airborne effect, you may cast this spell and attempt to rapidly inhale the entire attack -- even such odd breath weapons as a cone of fire or line of lightning.  This prevents the attack from having any effect anywhere in its area.</p>

<p>If the attack or effect had a saving throw, you must make a Concentration check upon casting this spell, against a DC equal to the saving throw.  If not, you need not make the Concentration check.  Success, or not requiring a check, means that you contain the effect in a tightly packed form inside your body.  If not, you suffer the effect in its strongest possible form -- for instance, a breath weapon would do maximum damage, or you would automatically fall asleep for the maximum duration, or so forth.</p>

<p>If you succeed in containing the effect, during your next turn you must expel the material again.  Treat this as a breath weapon attack with a save DC equal to a spell of Inhale's level for you; you are outside the area of effect.  If the original effect did not have a particular area, it becomes a 15 foot cone.</p>

<p>You may use this spell in normal atmosphere, in which case you produce a pair of <span style="font-style:italic">gust of wind</span> effects lasting a single round in a 15 foot cone, first toward you and then away from you.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Inhale, Deep</span><br />
Level: Sor 6, Wiz 7<br />
Duration: 1 round/2 levels<br />
Saving Throw: Fort or Ref; see text<br />
Spell Resistance: Yes</p>

<p>This spell is like <span style="font-style:italic">inhale</span> except as noted above, and with the following additional effects.  You may maintain the inhalation effect for up to 1 round per 2 caster levels before exhaling all inhaled materials at once, and you need not exhale immediately upon ceasing to inhale, until the spell's duration is up.  For effects inhaled more than once, increase the save DC by 2 per additional effect of the same sort.  You may attempt to inhale gaseous creatures, or Fine or smaller creatures, or swarms thereof, at the rate of one 5 foot square per round; you exhale crushed bodies, with no particular effect.  Fine creatures get a Fortitude save to avoid the effect; swarms get a Ref save.  Gaseous creatures are not harmed by being inhaled, and it is dangerous to inhale them; they make make Fort saves to escape their confinement each round, and if they do, they deal their HD in damage to you as they escape, plus any contact damage such as fire or acid.  This subjects you to all other effects inhaled, releases the effects in a 10-foot burst, and ends the spell.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">No breath</span><br />
Transmutation<br />
Level: Sor/Wiz 5, Clr 5, Drd 5<br />
Components: V, S<br />
Casting Time: 1 standard action<br />
Range: Touch<br />
Target: Creature touched<br />
Duration: 10 min./level<br />
Saving Throw: Will (harmless)<br />
Spell Resistance: Yes</p>

<p>You, or a creature you touch, no longer needs to breathe for the duration of the spell.  You cannot suffocate or be choked, and your saving throws against airborne poisons have a +10 bonus.</p>

<p>(This classic Planescape 2e spell seems to have missed being converted!)</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Purify Air</span><br />
Transmutation<br />
Level: Sor/Wiz 1, Clr 0, Drd 0, Brd 0, Rgr 1, Pal 1<br />
Components: V, S, DF<br />
Casting Time: 1 standard action<br />
Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)<br />
Effect: 20-ft. radius spherical or hemispherical region of atmosphere<br />
Duration: Instantaneous<br />
Saving Throw: No<br />
Spell Resistance: No</p>

<p>You clear a 20-foot region of atmosphere of mundane pollutants, such as smoke or nonmagical poison, and render it fresh and breathable.  You can make a dispel check against lingering spells or supernatural effects like <span style="font-style:italic">cloudkill</span> or a breath weapon, as if you had cast <span style="font-style:italic">dispel magic</span>.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Vacuum bubble</span><br />
Evocation<br />
Level: Sor/Wiz 3<br />
Components: V, S, M<br />
Casting time: 1 standard action<br />
Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)<br />
Effect: 20-ft. radius hemisphere or sphere<br />
Duration: 1 round/level<br />
Saving Throw: Ref negates, Fort partial<br />
Spell Resistance: No</p>

<p>You force all gases out of a hemispherical volume (spherical, if high above ground), with various effects.  This instantly extinguishes all nonmagical fires in the region and does damage to fiery creatures equal to the contact fire damage they normally do to other creatures.  Gaseous creatures may make a Ref save to escape the region or "ride" the expulsion; remaining in the region does 1d8 damage per round to them.  Flying creatures who require air to stay aloft fall to the bottom of the region.  Any breathing creature who remains in the region must hold their breath.  When the spell ends, inrushing air does 1d4 bludgeoning damage to all creatures within and the clap may deafen creatures within, with a Fort save DC of 10.</p>

<p>Research is ongoing into a combination of <span style="font-style:italic">devitalize air</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">vacuum bubble</span> to product a backdraft effect; so far, nothing much more spectacular than a <span style="font-style:italic">pyrotechnics</span> spell has been achieved.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Vacuum burst</span><br />
Evocation<br />
Level: Sor/Wiz 0<br />
Components: V, S<br />
Casting Time: 1 standard action<br />
Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)<br />
Effect: 10-ft. radius hemisphere<br />
Duration: Instantaneous<br />
Saving Throw: Fort<br />
Spell Resistance: Yes</p>

<p>You momentarily force atmosphere out of a 10-foot bubble, with various small effects.  This extinguishes flames of candle-sized or smaller and has a 50% chance to extinguish torch-sized flames or lanterns.  Flying creatures briefly lose any Dexterity bonus to AC.  Gaseous and fiery creatures are dealt 1d4 damage, which a Fort save may halve.  The clap of inrushing air at the end of the spell may break the concentration of spellcasters, who must make a Concentration check.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Vacuum welding</span><br />
Conjuration<br />
Level: Sor/Wiz 3<br />
Components: V, S, M<br />
Casting Time: 1 standard action<br />
Range: Medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)<br />
Target: 1 creature with metal armor or body, or 1 complex metal object<br />
Duration: Instantaneous<br />
Saving Throw: Fort negates, or Will negates (object)<br />
Spell Resistance: Yes</p>

<p>You force even the tiniest atoms of air out of the joins in between the metal parts of a complex object, causing a curious, heatless welding effect.  If you target armor or a held object, the wearer or wielder can make a Will roll to negate the effect; if you target a creature with metal parts to its body, it may make a Fortitude save.</p>

<p>If armor is welded, it hampers movement, giving a penalty to attack rolls, AC, and Reflex saves equal to the armor bonus of the base material.  The wielder moves at half normal speed, which does not stack with <span style="font-style:italic">slow</span>.</p>

<p>If a complex metal object is welded, its parts do not move, which will affect its functionality as the GM judges.</p>

<p>If a creature with a partially metal body suffers this spell, and its skin is its metal portion, it suffers the effect of welded armor, using its natural armor bonus + 3.  If its internal workings are also metal, it also suffers 3d8 damage +1/level (max +15).</p>

<p>Armor effects and damage to complex metal objects last until the object is repaired by a skilled craftsman; in the case of a metal creature, the armor effect lasts until the damage is repaired.</p>

         <p>Yeah, I'd been meaning to convert it, but never got to it.  Why did you choose to make it 5th level instead of 6th level, though?</p>

<p>(Also, those spells will be useful for when I work out the clerical domains for all the elements and paraelements-- I only plan to select the spells for the purpose of spell-like abilities for half-elementals)</p>

<p>Speaking of, you should make some sort of vacuum suction spell (not sure how that would work exactly, though).  Also, maybe a "steal breath" spell (yes, literally, the air is sucked out of the opponent's lungs and then fills your lungs.  Or whatever.)</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I have the idea of vacuum being were all the elements intersect. All the opposite elements cancel eachother out, resulting in a land of nothing. It's not that it is all nothingness. This is the unstable primordial soup of creation, and occasionally instead of evaporating or exploding, the intersecting elements merge into the quintessence of reality, which is much prized by mages. I'll have the Omnimentals live here, and have them be obstacles for adventurers trying to take the quintessence. The whole gimmick of this version is "The void from which everything emerged at the beginning of time".</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>There is no place where all the elements "intersect", if you look at the diagrams of the Inner Planes.  The closest anything comes to that is the Ethereal.</p>

<p>At any rate, one location I have (and history) is the er-- "phantom" remains of an Obhyrith lord slain by Cryonax and Sun-Sing during the Law-Chaos war.  The slaying actually took place on the Frigid Void, but Sun Sing dragged the obyrith lord's carcass back to his dominion, and encorporated it into part of his stronghold.  The exoskeletal remains only appear to be "quasi-there", and they're not etherealized, either.  It's actually more akin to solid air strongholds that air elementals use on their plane, except that it's vacuous (that is to say, indigenous elementals can treat it as either a solid object or pass through it freely, depending on what they "want" to do, while lords of a stronghold can will it to be a solid object to whomever they please.)  <br />
I have yet to choose a name for this fallen Obyrith lord (any ideas, folks?), but right before the time that the Archomentals and other inner planar inhabitants (minus the Wind Dukes) got involved in the war, this Obyrith Lord made a failed assassination attempt on Cryonax (its goal was to depose Cryonax in order to erect an Obyrith stronghold near Wind Duke base of operations)  At a later date, Cryonax was able to lure this Obyrith Lord into the Frigid Void (border region between Ice and Vacuum) in the hopes that the lack of air would weaken it, but the creature was not stupid enough to be lured deep enough into Vacuum to be significantly affected, and Cryonax was getting his ass kicked by its 10 heads.  Sun Sing took notice of the battle and threatened both combatants, but Cryonax managed to negotiate a deal with the Infinite Hunger to not only spare him, but to assist him in destroying the Obyrith (the deal was that Sun-Sing would get the bulk of the spoils-- Cryonax would get the Obyrith Lord's Water and Air essences, its quasidivine essences would be split evenly between the two of them, and Sun-Sing could have everything else, including his evil essence, his breath, and what remained of his physical body-- Cryonax also assured Sun-Sing that once he acquired his end of the spoils, that he would leave Vacuum and not bother the prince.)  The battle, once Sun-Sing entered it, tilted heavily in Cryonax's favor since Sun-Sing kept stealing the Obyrith lord's breath (essentially knocking the wind out of it) while Cryonax beat on it.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">
