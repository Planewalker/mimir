</div> <p>This is the first draft of my third take on this material.  Its the first<br />
time I actually managed to finish a draft of this material, so that looks <br />
fairly promising.  </p>

<p>    I'm interested in criticism on the writing (I think it's kinda dry, myself), <br />
and if you think this style is promising or if I should go back to the <br />
drawing board for take four.  I was going for brevity and non-historical, <br />
since the Unbroken Circle is a historical allegory (I think that's what you'd <br />
call it, at least).  Its also not supposed to be particularly nice.<br />

        The People were created by the strength of the Sword. <br />
                In the beginning, the people were Nothing, the slaves of the Masters of Nothing.   <br />
                The strength of the Sword was found by Gith.   <br />
                By the Strength of the Sword, the nothing became the People. <br />
                Your strength must be the Strength of the Sword. <br />
        The Life of the People is the life of the Sword. <br />
                In the beginning, the people had no life.  They were shattered by the whim of the Masters of No-Life. <br />
                Gith was whole, she lived the Life of the Sword. <br />
                The Life of the Sword became the life of the People. <br />

        The Speech of the People is the speech of the Sword. <br />
                In the beginning, the people had no speech.  They were the slaves of the Masters of Thought. <br />
                Gith learned the speech of the Sword.  Her speech felled the Masters of Thought. <br />
                The Speech of the Sword became the Speech of the People. <br />
                You must speak the Speech of the Sword. <br />

<p>Second Stanza (Search +4/Dex 14) <br />

                Those with no Speech speak much. <br />
                        Their noise is the noise of slaves. <br />
                        Their words are nothing. <br />
                        Their words remain thought. <br />
                        They fear deeds. <br />
                Those with Speech speak little. <br />
                        Their silence is the silence of readiness. <br />
                        Their words are the words of truth. <br />
                        Their thoughts become deeds. <br />

                        The walkers of the way fear nothing. <br />
                Those who are cowards have no life. <br />
                        They seek to make the strength of the weak Their own. <br />
                        They become weak, and make the weak strong. <br />

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>I think the general idea is a good one, and you have a good start here. </p>

<p>For constructive criticism, I'd start with going back to the original description of the item.</p>

<p>[url]<a href="rrakkma/node/_.html">/rrakkma/node/</a>]</p>

<p>If this represents teachings specific to gish, then it should focus on using both magic and combat abilities to defeat enemies. That what the gish are known for, and it would almost certainly be a central theme. What you have here is more of a general statement of some very basic and self-evident githyanki ideas.</p>

<p>I'd recommend focusing on one interesting and well-defined "lesson" per stanza. Right now, the "proverbs" are not particularly profound, and its sometimes not clear what the lesson or lessons of a stanza is/are. I'd say that at first glace, the lessons themselves probably need to be rethought. Remember, the githyanki are highly intelligent people who have had thousands of years to hone and codify their worldview. Simple statements like "the weak will fall" are probably one not worth recording as arcane knowledge. To make something like this truly memorable, you have to take it up a few notches. Tell us something we don't know about the githyanki. Make a few radical statements. Expose some of the obvious contradictions in the worldview of the githyanki, and then show us how the githyanki "forge" those contradictions as strengths, not weaknesses. </p>

<p>You use the metaphor of the sword, which is of course central to the concept. However, what you have written revolves around the general metaphor of an ordinary steel sword.  The sword is universally seen as a general metaphor for individual strength and steadfast determination. Swords must be strong enough to hold an edge, but flexible enough to not shatter when used. The githyanki, however, have *very* unique swords. How do the properties of those special silver swords (fluid swords that shift weight as needed) result in unique philosophical metaphors for the githyanki? Does a githyanki gish "flow and shimmer" in combat to overcome his foe? Does he shift back and forth from the solidity of hand-to-hand combat to the fluildity of magic in order to deliver the unexpected death blow? </p>

<p>What lessons are to be learned from the githzerai not following the lessons revealed here? They would be the obvious candidate for examples of how to utterly fail in this arcane and sacred githyanki philosophy. The githyanki would certainly focus on what specific ideals have made the githyanki successful and the githzerai unsuccessful. Similarly, the illithids could be shown as fools for solely relying on psionics. Their inability to withstand physical attacks due to overspecialization is of course a valuable lesson for gish.</p>

<p>It is things like this that will make this document unique and meaningful to the githyanki. By adding this sort of flavor, you end up with poetry that contains practical and useful teachings, but also  something which reinforces the idea that none but the githyanki could fully appreciate the finer points of this particular collection of arcane knowledge. Their unique history and worldview have led them to this very specialized collection of wisdom which is most deeply meaningful to them alone.</p>

<p>I think you have a great start here, and I would encourage you to keep at it. I'd recommend that you continue to dig into the githyanki published sources (Guide to the Astral Plane, Dungeon100/Dragon309, etc) to really get a "feel"for the finer points regarding the unique attitudes and worldview of the githyanki, and particularly the gish. The more you can encapsulate what makes the githyanki unique, the better this piece will be. Best of luck to you.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

    Has anything every established how old silver swords are?  The Unbroken Circle states that the Zerthimon's sword was steel, implying that this was the level of . . .

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>You can obtain the mags from eBay for a few dollars. The Dungeon is the most helpful, because it is bound with an issue of Polyhedron which is basically chock full of in-depth details about 3E githyanki and their culture. You can get the PDF version of Guide to the Astral Plane for $5 at <a href="http://www.rpgnow.com" title="www.rpgnow.com">www.rpgnow.com</a>. .  </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;Darkness_Elemental&#039;</em> wrote:</div>Has anything every established how old silver swords are?  The Unbroken Circle states that the Zerthimon's sword was steel, implying that this was the level of . . . 'technology' if you will, at the time the Circles were composed.   I was trying to date the Codex as having been composed at about the same time.</div>
Most of the published material does not say anything about the making of silver swords other than to say that their manufacture is a secret that the githyanki guard jealously. The 2E Guide to the Astral Planeonly states that the githyanki use "a silvery metal that is only found on the corpses of powers". The "corpses of powers" are a feature of the Astral plane. So silver swords could potentially go back as far as the githyanki migration to the Astral. </p>

<p>Now, remember that the technology described in the Circle of Zerthimon would not necessarily be representative of the technology of those who composed the work at a later date. As you say, it is a historical document, and that means it was written after the fact. As far as I know there are no hard information about exactly how long afterward it was written down. </p>

<p>However, since The Circle of Zerthimon mentions the division of the githyanki and githzerai, we do know at least that it could not have been composed prior to that conflict.  Therefore it is reasonable to assume that it was composed sometime after the migrations of the two peoples to their respective planes, which happened shortly after these events. If so, the githyanki could reasonably have possessed the technology to make silver swords at that point.</p>

<p>I feel I should stress that the article that you are building from is fan content, and the author has apparently created the whole "gish-as-parallel-with-zerth" concept entirely from scratch. Both the 2E and 3E materials talk routinely about the gish, but they never suggest that they are anything other than simply versatile individuals who focus on both combat and magic/psionic skills.  In my opinion, the Circle of Zerthimon does not seem to contradict the published materials, and it simply provides some "flavor" regarding the githzerai as described in those sources. However, the article about gish is purposefully deviating from the published sources and redefining a big category of githyanki warriors in an entirely new way. When building fan content on top of such fan content, you may find it more and more difficult to make your content agree with the published sources.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

And the nature of a silver sword is closely tied to the Astral Plane... the githyanki entered the astral only AFTER freeing themselves of the illithids, right?</div>
The assumption that the githyanki acquired the technology of silver swords just after the split is what I outlined above. However, it could have been even before the split.  I don't have the sources in front of me, but the general idea is that the githyanki and githzerai split, and then the githyanki migrated permanently to the Astral. The exact degree of overlap (if any) is unknown.  There is brief mention of the githyanki taking over illithid strongholds on the astral, so perhaps there were large githyanki settlements on the astral even before the zerai/yanki split . It is even conceivable that the silver swords were somehow acquired and used during the post-revolt war against the illithids, although nothing specific is stated one way or the other. So silver swords may indeed predate Two Skies. </p>

<p>Regardless, there is plenty of room for the assumption that silver swords would be as old as the Circle of Zerthimon.</p>

<p>As far as the githzerai having silver swords -- they do.  Githzerai occasionally possess silver swords, and at least one 2E source states that githzerai can indeed *make* silver swords, if memory serves. That being the case, not all silver swords possessed by githzerai would be stolen from githyanki. One could assume that the githzerai stole the knowledge of how to make the swords from the githyanki at some point in the past, but then there is really no way to know exactly when that might have happened. Perhaps the knowledge of how to make silver swords was obtained by the githzerai very early, but their ability to create the swords has always been severely limited by their very limited access to the special Astral metals required for the swords. It is logical to assume that the githyanki long ago secured all known sources of that metal, considering the central role silver swords have in their society.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Oh...<br />
I didn't know that, but it's easily enough to fix: the Gish that follow Gith's Codex are probably just a subset of the overall Gish catagory.</p>

<p>There is also plenty of room for the oposite assumption, that the silver swords are rather new.  They seem to be associated with the Knights, which seem to be a creation of the most recent Vlaakith.</p>

<p>In the end, this gets back to the same question that seems to pop up in any discussion of the Gith:  Time and old secrets.  It's these questions that make the Gith interesting for me, and it seems a shame to 'resolve' one of them by referencing Silver swords directly.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>This is true, but it was a bad idea, and rightfully retconned in 3e (and, really, in <span style="font-style:italic">Planescape: Torment</span> before that). It doesn't make sense for githzerai to make silver swords, which are most useful in attacking beings invading the Astral Plane. They're not effective, except as "normal" magical swords, against the githyanki themselves, who will almost never have silver cords to sever. Githzerai have no reason to make them (as well as little access to the proper materials). If they have any of them, it's likely because they stole them from the githyanki in order to keep them out of githyanki hands.</p>

<p>Far more useful and appropriate to the githzerai are <span style="font-style:italic">karach</span> blades, or simply unarmed combat.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div> at least one 2E source states that githzerai can indeed *make* silver swords, if memory serves.</div></p>

<p>After a quick look through the primary 2e sources (PSMC1, Planes of Chaos, Planewalker's Handbook), I didn't see any assertation of that nature. The PSMC1 claims that silver swords have powerful religious value to the githzerai, which is unlikely enough that it should be ignored and never discussed again (which is what happened in subsequent official sources). Read "karach blades" instead, or even ancient iron weapons wielded by heroes of Zerthimon's rebellion.</p>

<p>Silver swords are iconic githyanki weapons. Giving them to githzerai dilutes that and makes no sense. Keep them out of Limbo, I say. The tortured rationalization required to get them in githzerai hands (in any numbers) does more harm than good.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>To summarize: The post above by ripvanwormer is basically throwing out the source material and redoing it his way. I'm sure he'd disagree on that precise characterization, but that sums it up. </p>

<p>Fact 1: The older edition 1E  and 2E published materials consistently state that githzerai use silver swords in every single place the races are described in any detail. Official sources including the 1E Fiend Folio also state that githzerai even fabricate the silver swords they use. </p>

<p>Fact 2: Karach swords do not exist *at all* in the published material, and that includes all WOTC 3E materials as far as I can tell. They are quite simply never referred to except in the computer game Planescape:Torment. </p>

<p>Fact 3: As stated in the planewalker.com FAQ, Planescape:Torment doesn't mesh well with the published materials, and is not considered an official source. At best, it is a game loosely based on the Planescape setting, as considerable liberties were taken. One of those liberties is karach swords, used as a plot device for a main character in conjunction with the Unbroken Circle of Zerthimon, which was also invented for the game. Despite the popularity of both among fans of Torment, it is noteworthy that the authors of D&amp;D 3E saw fit to leave them out entirely when shaping the githzerai for 3E. Karach blades, in particular, are noteworthy by their absence. </p>

<p>So please keep these facts in mind as y'all move forward with this particular line of speculation. It's always helpful to know when you're ignoring existing source material that contradicts your ideas, so that you can do so strategically. Not everyone is *quite* as comfortable discarding and rewriting the source material as ripvanwormer appears to be. I know I very much prefer ideas that attempt to stick close to the setting as published.</p>

<p>In either case, let's not forget that this thread is about expanding on Rhys' concept of a githyanki "Codex of Swords", specifically speculating on what sort of githyanki-related philosophies and wisdom would deserve to be in this collection of githyanki arcane wisdom.  Although the "Codex of Swords" has been described as a parallel to the Unbroken Circle of Zerthimon in some ways, the discussion of the Circle and githzerai weapon usage isn't terribly relevant to the relationship between githyanki and their swords.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

          Gith&#039;s Sharp-Edged Codex        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;Darkness_Elemental&#039;</em> wrote:</div>... it's easily enough to fix: the Gish that follow Gith's Codex are probably just a subset of the overall Gish catagory.</div>
That makes perfect sense to me. There might even be some room there for expansion of that idea, and that may lead to more ideas about the wisdom contained in the Codex of Swords. Why is that faction of gish different from other gish? Is it an historical or philosophical difference, or perhaps both? Why, exactly, is the codex about swords/blades instead of something else?</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;Darkness_Elemental&#039;</em> wrote:</div>There is also plenty of room for the oposite assumption, that the silver swords are rather new.  They seem to be associated with the Knights, which seem to be a creation of the most recent Vlaakith.</div>
Well, no, not according to the WOTC (and older TSR) materials. Higher githyanki of all (sword-wielding) classes have historically wielded silver swords in 1E, 2E and 3E. For example, in the MM4 a regular githyanki captain wields a silver sword. Knights do indeed use the most powerful silver swords, but that only makes sense, since they occupy the most prestigious position in githyanki society. You are correct, knights did not exist prior to the Lich Queen. But that has nothing to do with the githyanki using silver swords as such.</p>

<p>In fact, the article on githyanki in Dungeon 100 ("Knights of the Lich-Queen") observes that the most powerful silver swords (as described in the 3E MM) must predate the Lich-Queen. They were forged when githyanki could achieve epic levels, and thereby forge these epic weapons on occasion. As far as I can tell, this makes perfect sense considering the rules. Making a +5 vorpal weapon with the additional enhancements defined for these specific swords/artifacts would not be possible given the level restrictions the Lich-Queen had in place. So if my understanding of all this is correct, the most powerful silver swords must have been crafted before the Lich Queen absorbed the most powerful githyanki, and that craft presumably had been in use for quite some time even at that point. Which, with all due respect, is almost the opposite of your assertion above.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;Darkness_Elemental&#039;</em> wrote:</div> In the end, this gets back to the same question that seems to pop up in any discussion of the Gith:  Time and old secrets.  It's these questions that make the Gith interesting for me, and it seems a shame to 'resolve' one of them by referencing Silver swords directly.</div>
As I've explained, there is no contradiction at all with the source material if you describe the development of Rhys' "gish" and the development of silver swords in conjunction, and binding the two together in a "Codex of Swords" or “Sharp-Edged Codex” made of blades seems an obvious choice. And as described above, some of your assumptions about the history of silver swords may actually be inaccurate. I see no way in which this detracts from the interesting history of the githyanki. In fact, it literally couldn’t be more appropriate, considering the sheer volume of space devoted to silver swords in basically every description of githyanki in any source.  There’s no way to avoid it -- githyanki and their silver swords are basically synonymous, so that is the obvious angle to take here. </p>

<p>But OK, let's take the other approach for a minute. Let’s assume that you decide take the most conservative approach, perhaps saying that all silver swords were created very late, perhaps in the period just prior to the Lich Queen’s ascension to the throne, and that they therefore occur too late for your Codex. </p>

<p>What are you left with that belongs in something called the “Codex of Swords” or “Sharp-Edged Codex”? </p>

<p>You’ve chosen the metaphor of the sword.  Considering that you have stated that you want to stick with a very, very early githyanki timeframe, you would be writing something almost as relevant to the githyanki as the githzerai (all the "people of Gith"), since the two were very similar at that time. You would probably start with something resembling a variation on of the sword-oriented parts of the Circle of Zerthimon ("Scripture of Steel", etc.), but only after stripping out two large components that make the Circle so appealing  -- the historical references describing the githzerai perspective on Two Skies, and the powerful allegory of how that sequence of early githzerai historal events mirrors the philosophical sequence of development of the mind of a modern githzerai sage. </p>

<p>This, to a large extent, describes what you have above.  It's interesting, but lacking in punch or relevantce to the githyanki in particular. The beauty of the Unbroken Circle of Zerthimon is that even though it was written long ago, it still tells you a lot about the githzerai *today*. The further you dig, the less relevant this becomes to anyone other than the githzerai. You seem to be saying that your goal is to create something similar and parallel to the Circle but geared toward the githyanki. If you can find those new angles that would make this thing similarly powerful and githyanki-oriented, then I think you’d have a great starting place for something that really does stand up to the Circle of Zerthimon. </p>

<p>And if you can come up with an equally interesting alternate approach that doesn't involve silver swords, then you’re a creative person indeed. But I honestly don't see anything coming remotely close to the appeal of silver swords considering that swords and blades are the theme of this particular piece. Rejecting silver swords out of hand is, in my opinion, a lost opportunity.</p>

<p>And as far as being hesitant to resolve mysteries -- that's one of the reasons this forum is here. If you do wish to preserve the mystique of the githyanki, you just need to add several new mysteries for each one you illuminate. It's part of the creative process.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;Invisig0th&#039;</em> wrote:</div>To summarize: The post above by ripvanwormer is basically throwing out the source material and redoing it his way.</div></p>

<p>When the source material is poorly considered, and meshes poorly with both what we know about the githyanki and the very physics of the multiverse, I think that's the best solution. It's the solution that 3e materials have used.</p>

<p>There are various things you can dig up in ancient sourcebooks that don't work very well in the planes as they eventually became, and silver swords for githzerai is one of them. Rather than attempt to cram in every reference in every source ever, a consistent and sensible multiverse is to be preferred. </p>

<p>I'd similarly be wary of incorporating something like slaadi forehead symbols as they were portrayed in <span style="font-style:italic">Fiend Folio</span>, or demon amulets from the 1st edition <span style="font-style:italic">Monster Manual I</span>, or the rules for eladrin aging in <span style="font-style:italic">Warriors of Heaven</span>, or the fate of the souls of the Athar in <span style="font-style:italic">Guide to Hell</span>. These are all from published sourcebooks, but they mesh poorly (to varying degrees) with the Planescape multiverse. Some of the divine realms in <span style="font-style:italic">Warriors of Heaven</span> are very problematic as well, particularly the idea that Ixion lives in the phoenix nest from <span style="font-style:italic">The Deva Spark</span>, which certainly didn't seem to have a god in it in that adventure.</p>

<p>Not all source material is equal. Just as parts of <span style="font-style:italic">Torment</span> have to be ignored, parts of books published by TSR and WotC should be seriously be considered before treating them as "canon" for Planescape. </p>

<p>For the purposes of Planewalker, in most cases individual authors can decide for themselves what to include. For the "official" stuff, we can have a vote.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Fact 2: Karach swords do not exist *at all* in the published material, and that includes all WOTC 3E materials as far as I can tell. They are quite simply never referred to except in the computer game Planescape:Torment. </div></p>

<p>To the contrary. I direct you to <span style="font-style:italic">Uncaged: Faces of Sigil</span>, page 124, which features a githzerai anarch who forges weapons of <span style="font-style:italic">karach</span>. See also the 2nd edition <span style="font-style:italic">Planescape Campaign Setting</span> boxed set, in <span style="font-style:italic">Sigil and Beyond</span>, page 51, where <span style="font-style:italic">karach</span> was first introduced.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Planescape:Torment doesn't mesh well with the published materials</div></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Torment</span> is in fact notable for its extreme fidelity to the Planescape line (which makes sense, given the close involvement of Colin McComb and at least peripheral involvement of David "Zeb" Cook), and in most cases it meshes perfectly with published materials. The main exception of the whole Shr'akt'lor melting away business - which, although it does mesh with published materials insofar as it's something that certainly <span style="font-style:italic">could</span> have happened, isn't something that happened in WotC's timeline. I wouldn't consider it all "canon," but certainly the vast majority of elements from it are ripe for use.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Despite the popularity of both among fans of Torment, it is noteworthy that the authors of D&amp;D 3E saw fit to leave them out entirely when shaping the githzerai for 3E. Karach blades, in particular, are noteworthy by their absence.</div></p>

<p>Well, that's the point I keep making. Githzerai wielding silver swords are noteworthy in their absence from any 3e materials. That particular weapon is an iconic githyanki symbol, and it's a very bad idea to go back to the bad old days when that was diluted. Whether or not you like <span style="font-style:italic">karach</span> blades, it's better to give githzerai something else.</p>

<p>My guess is that karach weapons haven't been fleshed out in 3e for the following reasons:</p>

<p>- The two 2e references to karach are very obscure, and most 3e designers don't know Planescape very well.<br />
- Githzerai are primarily portrayed as unarmed combatants in 3e.<br />
- There simply hasn't been very much development or detail on the githzerai or the plane of Limbo in this edition. It wasn't until the MM4 that Zerthimon was even mentioned in a 3e WotC book, for example, and we still haven't gotten any mention of the Floating City.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Well then, let me make a slight correction: the "original" reference to karach says nothing about it being used by githzerai. Yes, there is one other reference to one particular githzerai (among the many dozens mentioned in various sources) making "weapons" out of the material. My mistake. </p>

<p>However, my original point is still completely valid. There is apparently NO reference to githzerai karach blades as such, much less any reference to them playing a significant role in githzerai (or zerth) society, in the official materials. That plot device was indeed invented whole cloth for PS:T, as I stated. Something you have still failed to admit, ripvanwormer, although your entire concept rests on it.</p>

<p>As far as the rest of your rant -- you are welcome to whatever opinion you like, but you are NOT welcome to whatever facts you like. I'm getting sick and tired of you starting a flame war every time someone simply points out how drastically far your bizarre and poorly-supported ideas deviate from the existing official material. This is the *third* thread in a row in this forum where you've done this same exact thing. You KNOW that your idea contradicts published sources, but yet you will apparently defend it ENDLESSLY when people point out that fact. You make no distinction between people offering alternate *opinions* and people simply observing the *facts* regarding what does and does not fit within publsihed material from among the things you say.  This seems to be a chronic problem. </p>

<p>Please try to find ways in which you can POSITIVELY contribute to the discussion. I'll point it out again - your personal theories about githzerai zerth blades offer NO assistance to the original author of this thread whatsoever regarding his questions about githyanki. You've literally gone off on a tangent, and you are clearly intent on beating that tangent TO DEATH until everyone agrees with you. That fact should give you pause for consideration, but apparently it doesn't register. By persisting at such pointless "debates", you accomplish nothing other than scaring off other people who might like to join into the discussion. You've stated your alternate theory here, now move on with your life. Please show some consideration for others. </p>

         <p>Invisig0th, I think you are correct:  Silver Swords were meant to be an ancient invention, and I should think about what effect, if any, they would have had on the writer(s?) of the Codex.</p>

<p>Right now, I think that I will not make it explicitly about Silver Swords, but instead try to work in a suggestion or two that the Githyanki's idea of an ideal "sword" is not the same as ours.  The sword metaphor was not meant to be very explicit anyway, so I think that approach will mesh best.</p>

<p>You've also pointed out the chief difficulty I'm having right now:  I have successfully stripped out all the specific-to-Githzerai, which included everything that made the Circles interesting.  I'm kind of falling out of love with this third take on the material as well:  The principle idea was that the 'yanki would be brief and to the point, but that means that <span style="font-style:italic">every line</span> has to be an important philisophical thought, which is . . . taxing . . . to write.</p>

<p>The origenal discription said that there was tension between the followers of this Codex and the Knights of Vlaakith.  I am including one possible reason for that tension, but at the moment it is not coming through because of the difficulty I'm having with the 4th and 5th sections.</p>

<p>And Rip-<br />
I agree with you that Silver Swords should be reguarded as exclusively (or at least, nearly exclusively) Githyanki, despite some of the earlier sources on the subject, but I would prefer that you started a new thread on the subject.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Making something that stands up to the Unbroken Circle is no small task. But perhaps you're making things too hard on yourself.</p>

<p>Remember that the githzerai are the ones who are known for being extremely brief and to the point. Githyanki are occasionally terse (i.e. commands in battle), but they also have a deep love for the elaborate in their craftsmanship and art. So one could expect something as special as the Codex to be much more wordy and flowery than the Unbroken Circle for this reason, perhaps being more of a narrative rather than a string blow-by-blow recounting of the events and their explicit meaning as we see in the Circle. Perhaps the primary mystery of the Codex is in how to distill the precise (and perhaps somewhat convoluted and complicated) philisophical ideas from the greater, less specific narrative structure. Basically, I would assume the Codex would be much *less* literal than the Circle for this reason.</p>

<p>In some ways, the nature of the Unbroken Circle also makes your task harder. Basically, the Unbroken Circle "used up" most of the relevant subject material, even that which seems to be a poor fit, leaving precious little room for a second parallel document.  In my opinion, the whole focus on swords and the Scripture of Steel always seemed a little irrelevant to what the githzerai ultimately became. Mostly, it was just relevant to the shared history of the rebellion. To completely avoid overlap, you basically have to restrict yourself to the githyanki after the split, and there's very little info on what they were like at that point. We know a little bit about what they were before that, and what they were later, but not much in between.</p>

<p>However, I'd urge you to not to get discouraged.  Consider that there is a whole lot of room for expansion here, lots of room for creativity. Even in Rhys'  article, very little is said about the actual content of the Codex, so it's almost a blank canvas. Every artist knows that a blank canvas can be intimidating. Don't be afraid to be creative and add brand new angles, much like Rhys did. Provided that you can discover how and where you are deviating from previous materials, you can do so purposefully and strategically to open up new doors. And if it's unclear how well something fits with the source materials, just ask. There are any number of people in this forum who are familiar with the source material. As long as you stick to the *spirit* of the existing info on githyanki, you should be fine.</p>

<p>I hope that in some small way our discussion of this has helped you to analyze and reevaluate the aspects that could logically be relevant to the Codex, hopefully contributing to making the Codex more engaging.  I think it would be interesting to hear some of the other regulars' opinions as well.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>No, just a reference to a githzerai forging blades from <span style="font-style:italic">karach</span>. </p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Planescape: Torment</span>'s primary innovations regarding <span style="font-style:italic">karach</span> were:</p>

<p>1. It defined exactly what karach did.<br />
2. It associated karach blades specifically with the <span style="font-style:italic">zerth</span> caste of githzerai.<br />
3. It implied that there was only one such weapon remaining, and Dak'kon had it.</p>

<p>I'm not suggesting that any of these Torment-specific innovations be adopted. I'm only pointing out that, as silver swords are essentially only <span style="font-style:italic">Swords +1</span> in githzerai hands (which disrupt psionics and are effective against those vulnerable to silver), it doesn't make sense for them to make them. The idea that githzerai wielded them is a relic of a time before the precise functioning of the <span style="font-style:italic">Astral Projection</span> spell was defined, and once it was established that characters in Limbo don't have silver cords to cut, the situation became silly. 3e has recognized that, removing all references to silver swords from the githzerai monster description. This, I can say with assurance, is a retcon. </p>

<p>I suggested several fixes to this: they could wield ancient relics of iron, they could wield karach weapons, or they could wield no weapons at all. Karach is a canonical material made from the substance of Chaos, at least occasionally by githzerai smiths, so it makes a logical replacement for the material used to make githyanki silver swords. </p>

<p>We could make <span style="font-style:italic">karach</span> weapons very close to silver swords, but at the same time distinctive. They could still disrupt psionics, as that's a very valuable ability for a githzerai weapon to have, and it makes sense that a chaos weapon would do that. </p>

<p>They could even be silver in color, for that matter, and standard silver swords fit the description of <span style="font-style:italic">karach</span> as "shapechanging metal." They can be very close to githyanki silver swords, and this would be a good way to reconcile the various sources. The primary point is that making them identical to githyanki silver swords is an example of adopting material from prior editions without properly considering how things have changed.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>although your entire concept rests on it.</div></p>

<p>No, my concept is as above. None of the <span style="font-style:italic">Torment</span> innovations are integral to it, and in fact I would recommend against them. Karach blades should be available to githzerai other than <span style="font-style:italic">zerths</span>, and certainly Dak'kon shouldn't be the last wielder of one. Rather than making them function like Dak'kon's blade, they could work much like githyanki swords, with a different (more chaotic) ability replacing the power to sunder silver cords, which is useless to githzerai.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Invisig0th gave good advice here, comparing the githyanki to <span style="font-style:italic">silver swords</span> rather than a generic steel sword. Although Gith herself almost certainly did not wield a silver sword for most of her career, the silver sword is still the most powerful metaphor the githyanki have. They could interpret the sword of Gith as having the same metaphorical qualities as a silver sword.</p>

<p>Try: "The People were created by the strength of the Sword; they are like the Sword, flexible enough to bend but never break, and cut that which cannot otherwise be cut."</p>

<p>The racial modifiers for githyanki are +2 Dex, +2 Con - tough but flexible, like a silver sword. The sword can also be a metaphor for the cutting edge of a githyanki's intellect. They are not smarter than humans, but in intellect they definitely shine above their githzerai cousins.</p>

<p>They also have a penalty to wisdom. They prefer acting swiftly, and view consideration as weakness. The Sword acts without thought. The Sword <span style="font-style:italic">is</span> thought, and thought is best manifested as action. The illithids considered too much, and this was their weakness. The followers of Zerthimon hesitated because they were overthinking what must be done. They were weak, but the children of Gith were strong, and continued to push forward. Githyanki are intelligent, but not thoughtful.</p>

<p>I think most of your standards are very good. I have an issue only with this:</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>                Those with Speech speak little. </div></p>

<p>As this seems more of a githzerai characteristic. Githzerai are taciturn and silent. Githyanki are much more loquacious. </p>

<p>I would also suggest that maybe githyanki call themselves something other than the People, as that seems pretty distinctively a githzerai thing. Maybe something like the Race - similar, but perhaps a little more ominous, as it has more racist connotations.</p>

<p>Remember the psychology of githyanki - they live in a plane outside of Time. Time, for them, is something that happens elsewhere. The past and future only exist on other planes. </p>

<p>The plane of the githyanki is a formless plane of pure thought. Nothing is truly substantial there, though it may seem like it; form is an illusion. </p>

<p>Githyanki are highly psionic. Their life is experienced as a relationship between the pool of psychic energy within them and the pool of similar power flowing through the void outside them.</p>

<p>Finally, it might be good to consider exactly what happened when Gith united the race. How did she discover the power of the sword? How did she discover the power of unity? How did she meet Zerthimon and Vlaakith I? What were her motivations in bargaining with Ephelomon and Tiamat? Those who wrote this text probably didn't know the answers to any of this, but what did they <span style="font-style:italic">believe</span>?</p>

<p>Finally, this doesn't have to be the be-all, end-all of githyanki philosophy. It might be one of many such texts, so there's no reason to include everything I've mentioned.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>ripvanwormer,</p>

<p>In case there is any confusion on your part, I have no interest in wasting time rebutting your endless stream of point-by-point ramblings about your confused reinterpretations of my posts. I have no interest in discussing anything with you, whatsoever. I shall not be feeding you, troll. So please feel free to post what you want, but do not expect one shred of cooperation or respect from me. I may point out your errors, but I will not waste time debating you. You are persona non grata. Three strikes, you're out.</p>

<p>So take your predictable, relentless attempts at fueling an argument, such as the <a href="forum_.html" class="bb-url">most recent one above</a>,  and stuff 'em. Your assertions are indeed full of holes, but I won't be encouraging you by detailing them. You're wasting your time, as well as the time of everyone else who would like to read this thread to find out about the original post. I'm asking you one more time, please cease trying to provoke me, because I have no interest in playing your game.</p>

<p>I hope I've made myself clear. If you have any further concerns, please send a private message instead of continuing to spam this thread with your attempts at provokation.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">
