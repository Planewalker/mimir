<span>Clueless come to the Multiverse all the time.  Some come willingly, while many others arrive by happenstance, fate, or just plain bad luck.  No matter how a Clueless arrives on the Planes, the experience can shake the core of even the most jaded soul.  The Multiverse offers a whole new host of experiences, meanings, and systems that most Clueless can only dream about.  To live that as reality can be mind-breaking.  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>Still, many Clueless get by, often becoming canny planars in their own right.  A reasonable number get by on their own merit.  They are clever bloods from scrappy backgrounds who are good at adapting to sudden changes and resourceful on the spot.  Others wouldn't survive if it weren't for the help of some genuinely well-meaning planars taking the poor sods under their wing.  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>My comic project, <a href="forum/a-preview-my-project_.html" class="bb-url">previewed here</a>, will introduce a Clueless as the main character.  Fortunately for him, he'll come across a helpful tout who's very willing to educate the Prime about the mess he's landed in.  Part of my intent with the comic is to introduce other OOC-Clueless to the Multiverse by letting them experience the planes vicariously through the main character.  </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>However, Qul's adventures and K'zink's teaching are only one way for a Clueless to learn about the Multiverse.</span> 
</p>
<p>
<span>So how would you do it?  How would you have a Clueless learn about the planes?  Or, for a more interesting take, suppose you are a well-meaning planar who just encountered a Clueless -- any Clueless.  How would you teach the Clueless about where he is?  Where would you take him, if anywhere?  How should he be advised?  There are as many ways to educate Clueless as there are locations in the Multiverse, so what is your take?</span>

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><p>
<span><span>Firstly, I'd calm him (or her) down a bit by letting him know that there <em>is</em> a portal home, if it can be opened. But I'd also explain getting back is really out of his circle for now.</span> </span>
</p>
<p>
<span><span>Secondly, I'd explain the multiverse by starting at his world and trailing outwards. I'd explain the Material Planes, Inner and Outer and everything knocking about between. If at all possible I'd have him meet people from these planes, to give the clueless a sense that what I'm telling him is more than just words.</span> </span>
</p>
<p>
<span><span>Hang on let me back track, <em>firstly and a half</em>, we get a inn for the night, inns are fairly universal, even for barbarians, even for mindflayers. Inns, taverns, bars and the like are actually a kind of elemental and appear everywhere when there is enough people. But thats another story.</span> </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>After a couple of nights at the inn I'd take the berk to a tailer and buy him some new gear, as long as he looks out of place he <em>will be</em>. If he's the fighting type I'd see about selling any weapons he doesn't prize and getting something better. Why weild and flint rock when you can have a second hand dwarven throwing hammer or a half-price flaming sword? (You wouldn't want to spend too much, you see) </span>

<span>The factions would be avoided like a plague, a clueless has nothing to offer them, he'd end up as Hardhead front-liner on Baator or used as a bookend for the Fraternity of Order. I'd simply explain that the factions are for those that know much of the multiverse, and seek to know more, you're not at that level yet. </span>
</p>
<p>
<span> I'd learn from him what he was on his own world and see about getting him a teacher to expand on it, if he was a warrior I'd find a Fighter or Warblade teacher (not aligned to a faction), if he was a rogue though...thats a tough one, because the teacher could well be linked to some crime or another and in fact, I bet it's hard to find someone openly teaching the sneakier arts. Reguardless, he would be trained into something useful. Something with class levels and a over-powered set of feats. (While in the game we try to avoid power-gaming, if you were really in Sigil...well) </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>Ha wow, I was answering that as honest as possible, I guess I'm too nice. Safe to say, he'd make headway in Sigil before I let him loose on the planes...which wouldn't make for a good story. <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/wink.png" title="Eye-wink" alt="Eye-wink" class="smiley-content"/> </span>

<p>I can't say that I'd avoid the factions ... they can offer a berk quite a bit in the way of training and direction and are always on the lookout for new recruits.  Sure he's start out on the bottom rung, but there is room for advancement depending upon what faction you put him in ... like you say, I wouldn't introduce him to the Harmonium, but the others aren't all so bad.  Being biased, if he had any tallents the Sensates would appreciate I'd introduce him to them ... if nothing else they might pay a few stingers to hear about his world and the experience which brought him to the cage.</p>

<p>Really, though, I'm no tout, so I'd simply figure out which faction was the best fit for him and releave myself of the responsibility; I have a show to put on, berk.</p>

<p>(likewise, if I ended up in Sigil, the first thing I'd do is head to the Festhall and sign myself up with the Sensates)</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>I think pigeonholing all 'Clueless' together is facetious. There are many varied times of primes stumbling through portals for the first time on any given day. They will have vastly different power, knowledge, and comfort levels with the unknown depending on their personal situations. </p>

<p>In fact, some 'Clueless' may be primes who, though they have a very biased viewpoint, have a far greater level of planar knowledge than many of the planars around them (especially if you properly apply the 3e rules, even if you rule Knowledge (the planes) to be a class skill for all planars as I often do, many planars will have few if any ranks in it, especially members of NPC classes concerned only with their local situation). The average prime cleric or wizard is likely to know more than the planar man on the street, though not likely about the particular locality he happens to hve landed in.</p>

<p>Likewise, any prime of moderate power, meaning somewhere from about 6-8th level and anything above that, is likely going to be able to prove himself as a person of ability, or be assessed as such and, if intelligent, learn the modicum he needs to stabilize his situation while others court his abilities. The original planescape box had a number of canny references about not messing with high level primes just because they seem a bit confused. The 20th level prime wizard who just got sucked through a portal to the abyss and can't tell a manes from a mallirith is still a 20th level wizard.</p>

<p>Additionally, suitably adventurous primes with a standard of the normal prime material caution will find that much the same rules apply on the planes and will go looking out for information on their own with a reasonable chance of finding it. A lot of common sense still applies after all, like don't believe large horned creatures that reek of evil, don't walk down narrow alleys at night, and don't get into arguments with fanatics. </p>

<p>I find that all of this is reflected in the first few chapters of <span style="text-decoration:underline">Pages of Pain</span> (by far the best part of the book), which might also be called 'Sigil through the eyes of a Clueless bad-ass.' While most primes wouldn't have anything near his skill set, they also wouldn't be trying to deliver a package to the Lady of Pain, so I think they could manage.</p>

<p>Remember, part of the reason the clueless get such a bad name is because a huge proportion of them are low-level members of NPC classes like commoner who walked through temporary portals carrying just whatever they were walking about town with, meaning probably no money. The real world analog they most resemble is human trafficking victims; in fact, I'd like to coin a new bit of planescape slang:</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Portal Trafficking Victim</span> - politically correct term for destitute clueless, used by some Celestials and members of the upper classes.</p>

<p>Now, when dealing with one of the truly Clueless, meaning a prime of low-level with very limited knowledge I'd probably start with 'Imagine you've been teleported to the other side of the world by an angry wizard, that's not what actually happened, but the effect is about the same.' That should help establish a conceptual framework to work from, after that its simply a matter of lining the Clueless' skills up with what someone needs, so that he can start on the part towards getting what he wants.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>&gt;&gt;Remember, part of the reason the clueless get such a bad name is because a huge proportion of them are low-level members of NPC classes&lt;&lt;</p>

<p>I disagree - I believe the reason the Clueless get such a bad reputation is that most of them are adventurers with a middle ammount of experience and a over inflated opinion of their own knowledge.  They think that because they've read a book on the planes, written by some prime philosopher/wizard, or tangled with a few summoned demonoids, they know the dark of things in the multiverse.  Trick is, there's a heck of a lot more to surviving in the planes than knowing the names and the scholarly qiucknotes.</p>

<p>You're probably correct in that the average planar doesn't have a high number of ranks in planar lore, as his experience is all first hand - street lore - which can be far more valuable when dealing with living, breathing, creatures.  (knowing the theorized origin of the Pit Fiend isn't going to be as useful as knowing that buying one a "raped virgin on brimstone" down at the Styxe Oarsman is the best way to put it in a mood not to kill you when you accidentally run your body collector's wagon into it.)</p>

<p>Another reason people disdain Clueless is they tend to believe the great titles they earned themselves on their own backwater little prime means pike all once they step into the wider multiverse.  A body doesn't care if you're king of Yappiville once you've rattled you're bones into the Cage - here you're just one more berk who has to cut his teeth and earn his respect all over again.</p>

<p>Speaking of respect, adventurers who make their way to the planes tend to think very highly of themselves and as such forgot to show the proper respect to those around them ... not a wise choice on the planes, where respect is a form of currency itself ... especially since you can't ever know just who or what that person standing next to you really is.</p>

<p>Clueless will earn or lose respect through their actions, just like anyone else, it simply becomes more difficult for them once they identify themselves as Clueless.</p>

<p>And that 20th level Mage?  I just saw him down the street doing lunch for a group of Tanaar'ri ... or was that being lunch for ...?</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>I tend to agree with Jack of Tears. The canon material emphasizes again and again that power is relative and that knowledge and belief are the most important form of power in the planes.</p>

<p>The difference between a planar and a prime is that a primes view of cosmology is Prime Material centric, and revolves around the mythology of their particular prime. Most of this knowledge will be either useless or worse yet misleading when that same poor sod is face with the multiverse. </p>

<p>Think of it this way. A 6th level wizard may be able to sling spells with the best of em, but all it takes is a wrong turn in the Hive and that same wizard ends up in the dead book. The difference between him and any self respecting planar is that no planar would ever make that mistake no matter what his level. Sure the planar might not be able to toss a fireball at a roving band of xaosmen, but he's peery enough to never put himself in a situation where he even needs to. </p>

<p>Similarly, a 12th level clueless fighter might not be able to distinguish between a Tanaari or a Baatezu, whereas for any planar, that would be second nature. The ability to make that kind of subtle distinction can mean the difference between life and death.</p>

<p>Yeah you've got some mechanics that give you a set of skills, and maybe some clueless has invested some points in some stuff, but so what? The mechanics are meant to reflect the reality of the game world, and if you grant a clueless wizard more practical insight into the multiverse than a native Sigilian because the wizard has 2 points in Knowledge Planes, I think you are missing an important feature of the Planescape setting, namely the urban/rural divide as represented by Sigil versus the Prime Material Plane. The problem is that the mechanic in this case simply isn't well suited to reflecting that particular nuance of the setting. It's an easy fix. Distinguishing between say Knowledge Prime Material Cosmology and Knowledge Planar might be a good start. Planars are meant to be worldly and cunning because it is necessary to survival in the planes and in Sigil. No prime cutter will ever match that unless he is exceptionally gifted, cunning and spends enough time on the planes to figure things out alla Rowan Darkwood. </p>

<p>To answer the original question though, if I were to try and explain the planes to a clueless, I would start big and work my way down. Basically, I would blow their minds with the ridiculous impossibility of the planes so that I could reassemble the pieces according to the dark of it all. Gradually trying to disabuse the guy of his preconceptions wouldn't cut it. He has to first know that everything he knows is wrong. Only then can you give him an idea of what's right, or at least what people think is right.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Public Sensorium. Plain and simple (if not expensive) way of experiencing planes without leaving the safety of Sigil. Plus it is great way to introduce the new clueless to Sensate faction. </p>

<p>True, maybe the factions are untrustworthy bunch who only care about new recruits but first hand experiences are hard to fake and will directly "tell" clueless what are planes all about. Plus it pays to have "Philosophers with Clubs" guarding your backs.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>Jack of tears</em> wrote:</div>I disagree - I believe the reason the Clueless get such a bad reputation is that most of them are adventurers with a middle ammount of experience and a over inflated opinion of their own knowledge.  They think that because they've read a book on the planes, written by some prime philosopher/wizard, or tangled with a few summoned demonoids, they know the dark of things in the multiverse.  Trick is, there's a heck of a lot more to surviving in the planes than knowing the names and the scholarly qiucknotes.</div></p>

<p>The demographic reality of D&amp;D indicates otherwise. Most 'Clueless,' especially in Sigil, will have walked through a portal by accident because it happened to open in some doorway on some random location on their prime world. Given that adventurers are perhaps 0.1% of the population, most of the clueless are not going to be adventurers. </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>Jack of Tears</em> wrote:</div>You're probably correct in that the average planar doesn't have a high number of ranks in planar lore, as his experience is all first hand - street lore - which can be far more valuable when dealing with living, breathing, creatures.  (knowing the theorized origin of the Pit Fiend isn't going to be as useful as knowing that buying one a "raped virgin on brimstone" down at the Styxe Oarsman is the best way to put it in a mood not to kill you when you accidentally run your body collector's wagon into it.)</div></p>

<p>While the setting tries to make out that street lore on the planes is 'oh so different' from street lore on the prime, if you actually did into the supplements that really doesn't hold a whole lot of weight. The same general rules about shady characters, unexplainable phenomena, and so forth, still apply. Prime cities are dangerous place too, after all. Sure Sigil's got a few of it's own truly unexpected hazards, Ooze Portals for example, but every planar locations is unique! A Sigilian is no more comfortable or locally knowledgeable in the City of Brass than a Prime is.</p>

<p>Oh, and to look at your example above, if you hit a pit fiend with something by accident, anyone worth anything is going to be deferential as all get out, but it really isn't going to make a difference. At any significant difference in level the Pit Fiend's response is going to be exactly what it wants to do, prime or planar isn't going to make a difference.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>Jack of Tears</em> wrote:</div>And that 20th level Mage? I just saw him down the street doing lunch for a group of Tanaar'ri ... or was that being lunch for ...?</div></p>

<p>And a 20th level mage would do something so stupid why? Is he going to be taken in by the roguish charm of beings that are obviously evil? (and detect evil works the same way everywhere in the multiverse) That he can almost certainly recognize as demons, though maybe not what type? That has a waaay higher save to resist their enchantments than a regular citizen. That has a contigency teleport spell to whisk himself to safety the moment he takes a hit?</p>

<p>Now, this is partly a personal opinion, but it's one I've discussed with a number of roleplayers who are fans of the planes but find some of the planescape material intimidating, is that there's really two kinds of planescape. There's Planescape, which is a wide open setting that is sort of a whole-greater-than-the-sum-of-its-parts mixture of absolutely everything found in D&amp;D, and then there's Sigilscape, which is the lavishing of an extraordinary amount of attention on a single city whose purpose is really mostly a mechanics gimmick and projecting the unique attitude of that specific city onto the rest of the multiverse for no good reason. </p>

<p>Yes, Sigil is an interesting and cool and important part of Planescape, but it's one city. It's like Waterdeep in the Realms, it doesn't control everything else.</p>

<p>Sigilians tend to see Primes at their most helpless and defensive in an environment that is about as hostile as a functioning urbanscape can get and interpose an additional and rather deliberate slang barrier as well. Of course they have developed a prejudice, but it's still prejudice, the reality is going to be different.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>The cluelessness of prime sods is not limited to activities in Sigil according to canon. It is emphasized again and again how primes are likely to misread situations that a planar would understand perfectly well. Naturally there is a bell curve of understanding, with some exceptional primes being unusually savvy, and some planars being a bit addle coved, but in the vast majority of cases, a planar will be able to make more intelligent decisions when faced with the politics of the planes than a prime will just because they are steeped in the culture of the multiverse in a way that primes aren't, and because they are afforded special status by virtue of their origins. </p>

<p>To use a real world example, the liberties afforded by the British during the height of Britain's imperial power were substantial in any of their colonies, and the special knowledge they possessed made them much more adept as a people at manuevering in foreign countries than, say, the Germans at that time. Conversely, any German or Indian trying to make a living in London faced a special set of challenges that the average Londoner could easily navigate. Power and Money could both shield you from some of those problems, but that power was contingent upon its political relevance in London, something a prime would never have in sigil, and so too with the Money part of the equation (unless you happened to go through a portal with a bag of holding full of jink that was in a fungible form). </p>

<p>Similarly, most D&amp;D prime worlds are fashioned around feudal medieval societies, whereas Sigil is distinctly metropolitan, with Baroque trappings. Paris in Medieval France is not the same as Baroque era London. The rest of the multiverse similarly has little in common with navigating the prime material. In essence, once you are dropped in Sigil (or really anywhere in the multiverse) from a prime, almost everything you know about politics and geography is rendered moot. You start from scratch. Perhaps the odd wizard might have some Prime material insights into the metaphysics of the Planes, but even that knowledge is Prime-centric and largely misinformed, as is mentioned again and again in the canon material. Is some of this bias? Sure. But it's fair to say that any prime dropped on the planes is at a distinct disadvantage, and sheer muscle can only do so much to get you through dangerous situations in the plane. ALmost always the opposition is capable of bringing more force to bear, so winning is usually as much about cunning and knowledge as it is raw power.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>The problem is, it is facetious to refer to a 'culture of the planes.' The various planes are vastly more different than the various prime worlds or the cultures within them (in fact the Prime Material has a degree of unity because of the internal linkages of Spelljammer, which is why racial pantheons are consistent across a large number of prime worlds).</p>

<p>Sigil has a specific culture, yes, and this culture is shared to degree by its planar 'neighbors' in the Outlands Gatetowns and a few sites on the outer planes strongly linked to Sigil. The rest of the planes, however, has an incredibly different culture were a Sigilian is just as isolated and out of their depth as a prime.</p>

<p>Also, your example of the British Empire is a good one, but the problems you highlight have a lot to do with long-term establishment of a livelihood and attaining political power, as opposed to establishing an immediate livelihood, especially for freebooting adventurers who don't usually bother with things like a fixed residence or business accounting, and who had an innate understanding of the cutthroat mentality of most planewalking citizens.</p>

<p>And I'm not saying that Primes don't have disadvantages compared to their Planar equivalents, they certainly have some issues, but I object to the view that Primes are sniveling incompetents who need a tout to hold their hand to do something as simple as walk down as street in Sigil without getting knifed. That applies to the 'Planar Trafficking Victims' I mentioned before, not to most Prime adventurers. It's an absurd stereotyping that leads to the idea that primes don't matter, and that Sigil is the only important part of the multiverse.</p>

<p>It also leads to illogical assertions that 'Clueless Primes are arrogant' when arrogance is the last thing you try to project when you're isolated in a foreign society (I recall particularly an experience when I had to walk through La Paz, Bolivia and try to find a pharmacy so I could buy cough medicine when I spoke absolutely no Spanish, a sense of entitlement was the last thing on my mind). Primes suddenly marooned on the planes are not going to act like rich jerk tourists.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

          Re: Welcome to the Multiverse!  What&#039;s your take?        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>&gt;&gt;The demographic reality of D&amp;D indicates otherwise. Most 'Clueless,' especially in Sigil, will have walked through a portal by accident because it happened to open in some doorway on some random location on their prime world. Given that adventurers are perhaps 0.1% of the population, most of the clueless are not going to be adventurers.&lt;&lt;</p>

<p>I guess it depends where one imagines those portals to be opening ... if you figure they're opening in the middle of corn fields and hog slops then it is feasible that you'll end up with quite a few hicks wandering into the city of doors - should, however, you imagine them more likely to open near ancient ruins, buried temples, or places of power - the very type of place adventurers are likely to frequent - then it seems your statistics would be skewed.  And, while it may be true that one tenth of a percent of all people are adventurers, you seem to be overlooking the fact that there are - theoretically - an infinite number of prime worlds out there, and as such no lack of adventuring population to plague the streets of Sigil and every other major planar metropolis.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt;While the setting tries to make out that street lore on the planes is 'oh so different' from street lore on the prime, if you actually did into the supplements that really doesn't hold a whole lot of weight.&lt;&lt;</p>

<p>But it is 'oh so different', because while Joe Bob adventurer might know how to stare down the local riff raff he won't likely know how to talk down a Yugoloth, or sweet talk an Illithid.  Sigil is a microcosm for the rest of the multiverse and a cutter is likely to find himself running into every sort of blood and addle cove on those streets given time.  Will a Cager be at home in the City of Brass?  Perhaps not, but demons to donuts he's likely to have a foot up on anyone stepping off the prime material boat, as it were.  </p>

<p>&gt;&gt;anyone worth anything is going to be deferential as all get out, but it really isn't going to make a difference. At any significant difference in level the Pit Fiend's response is going to be exactly what it wants to do, prime or planar isn't going to make a difference.&lt;&lt;</p>

<p>That may not be the way to deal with a Pit Fiend and the mislead berk who started pandering to the dicer might find themselves in the dead book for the mistake.  And how is the Fiend to know if their is a significant difference in level between himself and the character?  Remember, in the planes nothing is what it seems and no lanned cutter is going to believe he can just toss his weight around without concern ... a wise berk will play it clever and use that to talk his way out of a situation without tipping his hand.  A Cager in the know - who sees devils on the street every day of the week and so isn't about to be awestruck - is far more likely to play that encounter off so as to walk away than a primer who - like you suggest - only knows one response to seeing a Pit Fiend.</p>

<p>&gt;And a 20th level mage would do something so stupid why? &lt;&lt;</p>

<p>Note to self: Jokes are lost on some people.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt;there's really two kinds of planescape. &lt;&lt;</p>

<p>Any good logician, hell any poor logician, will tell you statements like that are fallacies. </p>

<p>That said, you're wrong.  I "have talked to many planer fans blah blah blah" and they agree that the proper presentation of the planes is a fine combination between the two.  When you're campaign is based in and around Sigil, then the city is very much the thing - but there is much more going on in the planes and many more places were entire campaigns can unwravel.  </p>

<p>&gt;&gt;a single city whose purpose is really mostly a mechanics gimmick&lt;&lt;</p>

<p>Really?  And considering it never made remotely the use of the 2E mechanics, that say Ptolus does for 3x, where do you get that assertion?  I would say it is a city with a good deal of flavor, designed as a place for players to call home and base of operations while exploring the planes, whereas they never had one before it was developed; making the planes as a place of adventure for lower level characters nonexistent. </p>

<p>&gt;&gt;It's like Waterdeep in the Realms, it doesn't control everything else.&lt;&lt;</p>

<p>And like Waterdeep, it is the city the biggest movers and shakers around come to do business - the difference is the size of the neighborhood in question ... the biggest movers and shakers in Sigil's vicinity tend to have more on their minds than the fate of one little prime material world.  No, it doesn't control everything, but deals are made there that shape the very nature of the planes and tilt the balance of ideas themselves - there is a reason why Factols keep kip in the City of Doors.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Wow, ah, while this debate is fascinating (no sarcasm intended, I have read most of these recent posts), I'd like to step in and redirect the discussion back to the point of the original post.</p>

<p>This thread isn't here to debate what Clueless are and how to define them or describe the context and theme of Planescape or anything like that. The purpose of this thread is to discuss how <span style="font-style:italic">you</span> would introduce a Clueless to the workings of the Multiverse. I realize it's an old thread that I haven't posted in for a long time, but quite frankly I don't believe this discussion has been at all relevant to the original question. It's not a hard question to tackle, so I really don't believe an in-depth analysis of the term Clueless and why it's good or bad is necessary to address my original post.</p>

<p>Clueless are Clueless. If you were somehow charged with doing it, how would you introduce one to Sigil, the Multiverse, whatever? </p>

<p>Also, Mechalich, I don't think "facetious" is the word you're looking for. I could be wrong, but the context in which you've used it each time suggests to me that you want a very different word.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Nah, it's more like I'm stretching the word and using it in a somewhat archaic fashion, that's all, as in 'amusingly absurd.' Oh, and some apologies for hijacking your thread, but I think everyone has offered an answer in one of their posts.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>And how is the Fiend to know if their is a significant difference in level between himself and the character?</div> </p>

<p>Because a Pit Fiend is a very intelligent, highly reasoned monster with a great deal of knowledge that can surely be expected to roughly assess the capabilities of anyone its comes across (and in fact has to expertly assess the abilities of everyone it comes across every day of its existence in the Nine Hells or lose its immortal life). It can also do things like measure the strength of auras, or simply toss a fireball at their faces to 'guess' their potency.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>That said, you're wrong.

<p>Really? The evidence indicates that the writers of the Planescape setting had a very distinctive pro-Sigil bias when they wrote the 2e supplements just by the amount of words devoted to Sigil and Sigil-related topics. The also had a pro-fiend bias (one that carried over to 3e) that is equally easy to discern. There are other lesser, but also obvious biases in how the setting was structured (The Ciphers are cooler than everyone else is one those).</p>

<p>Planescape was written to appeal to a certain demographic for marketing concerns: the aging devoted gamers of the shrinking TSR market base in the later years of 2e. It's message was 'buy planescape, play planars, be superior to all those dimwits playing lesser, prime settings.' It worked, people bought into it wholesale (it helped that the writing for planescape was flat out better than for many other settings).</p>

<p>That initial author bias is reflected in what the fans later found interesting and produce on their own, that's why planewalker has so many articles about Baator, the Abyss, and the Outlands compared to everywhere else. It's why Wizards can never keep the 'we have decided that all forms of devils are known' promise whenever they make a new monster book.</p>

<p>Effort generates interest. I know, because I've done it on a limited scale. I wrote 20,000 words on the Ethergaunts, posted it on the Rattler, and scared much of the online planescape fanbase witless (and probably made it so no one in their right mind would ever use such broken monsters again). </p>

<p>In order to run an inner planes centric campaign, I had to generate my own home base, and so 30,000 words created Slaan and I've been able to operate several planescape campaigns completely without Sigil.</p>

<p>Sigil has hundreds of thousands of canon words to make it real, that's probably more than most of the rest of the multiverse (minus the Ethereal, Astral, Baator, Abyss, and Outlands) <span style="font-style:italic">put together</span>. That's going to make it appear more important/valuable than it is.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Really?

<p>You made my point for me: Not a game mechanic, a setting mechanic, ie. a plot device. Sigil was designed for the explicit purpose of allowing low-level characters to 1. get to the planes and 2. not immediately die when they get there. It was then subsequently developed in a certain way, and the planescape setting was fashion around how it had been developed. Imagine how differently we might imagine Planescape if it had been based around the Infinite Staircase, which is far less hostile and more forgiving than Sigil while accomplishing almost the same function. </p>

<p>Sigil is run by the utterly enigmatic and astonishingly heartless Lady of Pain (and don't we love her for it!), The Infinite Staircase is run by what is practically a Victorian explorer's club. Extrapolate Sigil unto the entire multiverse, as is inadvertently done, and you get a multiverse of astonishing brutality, in good and evil, extrapolate the Infinite Staircase, and you'd get a Boy's Own Paper kind of multiverse.</p>

<p>Yet the reality of Planescape is that both, and many others, exist within the multiverse, so projecting one theme onto everything (particularly Sigil's, which often resembles we're-all-fighting-to-promote-our-own-brand-of-crazy) produces a less diverse and less interesting multiverse.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>&gt;&gt;It can also do things like measure the strength of auras, or simply toss a fireball at their faces to 'guess' their potency.&lt;&lt;</p>

<p>Which probably isn't a good idea when you've no idea what that thing is you're tossing the fireball at, and granting them the ability to determine level by reading auras is giving them an ability they aren't otherwise granted ... at least, not in the edition I'm used to. (which may have changed, I give you)</p>

<p>&gt;&gt;The Ciphers are cooler than everyone else is one those&lt;&lt;</p>

<p>I never really noticed that, hmmm ... </p>

<p>&gt;&gt;It's message was 'buy planescape, play planars, be superior to all those dimwits playing lesser, prime settings&lt;&lt;</p>

<p>I would say you're reading into it ... Though I would say it was a blatant money grab setting, as most of the books referenced one another.  You are correct, though, that the writing in PS is generally better.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt;if it had been based around the Infinite Staircase, which is far less hostile and more forgiving than Sigil while accomplishing almost the same function. &lt;&lt;</p>

<p>It would be far more boring ... the planes were already brutal and deadly before Planescape, the setting merely made them more accessible.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt;so projecting one theme onto everything (particularly Sigil's, which often resembles we're-all-fighting-to-promote-our-own-brand-of-crazy) produces a less diverse and less interesting multiverse.&lt;&lt;</p>

<p>I still fail to see why it has to be one or the other ... I have run fine adventures incorporating elements of both and suspect others have managed to do so as well ... you, yourself, tell me you've managed it.</p>

<p>Now, all that said, the original author did ask that we get back to the topic of the post, so we should probably try to steer that direction .... though I did already post on that regard and have little more to add.  I guess it would really depend upon what faction you were a member of, as your behavior would be dictated by that to a fair degree.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>How would I introduce a "clueless" to the workings of the Multiverse?<br />
I'd simply ask him if he has 10-20gp.  If he does, I'd direct him to the nearest tourist trap and advise him to buy "The Multiverse for Dummies" book.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">
