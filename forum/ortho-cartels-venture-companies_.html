<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-weight:bold">The Sharpstone Cartel</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Example of a large and powerful cartel</span></p>

<p>The idea that diamonds are the most precious of jewels is a relatively recent development in the history of Ortho. A few centuries ago diamonds were mined only in the Flamedance Mountains and the entire world production amounted to only a few pounds of material each year, supplemented by a few colonial supplies. Demand was mainly fed by spellcasters who used the stone’s reputed purity and indestructibility in several spells. Back then all diamond production on Ortho was controlled by the Sharpstone Clan, a band of immigrant orcish miners from Motmurk and their dwarven allies. Things have changed however, and now they are one of the richest and most powerful merchant houses on Ortho.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">History</span></p>

<p>Two hundred years ago, diamond production began to change: Ortho was becoming thoroughly explored and with it new supplies were being found. The expanding colonies also opened up additional sources of supply, and then explorers discovered a series of huge diamond mines in the new Province of Hazhkan, where precious stones could (almost) be scooped out of the ground by the handful. The wealth of the whole clan was under threat from a veritable deluge of diamonds: The Sharpstone masters feared that with more than adequate supplies, their product would become valued only as semiprecious gems. </p>

<p>Fortunately the leaders of the Sharpstone Clan were a pair of wily Freefolk adventurers called Zamuz the Elder (a local-born dwarf) and Hrothgar, leader of the immigrant orcs. Ruthless traders not afraid of taking risks, they began a two-fold strategy: To expand and unify (marrying native and colonial mining operations) and to take control of all aspects of supply and demand. </p>

<p>Hrothgar and Zamuz emptied the coffers of the clan and their own personal fortunes to buy influence with every gem-cutter, jewel merchant, and fashionable diamond-dealer they could find, both on Ortho and off. Those who’s couldn’t be persuaded, bribed, or openly bought out were blackmailed into submission or eliminated. </p>

<p>With titanic effort the Sharpstones took control of all major aspects of the gemstone trade, sometimes openly and sometimes via alliances, intermediaries, or assumed names. They made concerted efforts in every city on Ortho and each colonial capitol, and sometimes they ran afoul of the Harmonium; when that happened the agents involved (usually Freefolk or the local underworld) were immediately disavowed by the cartel, who feigned being appalled by such practices. A skilled combination of diplomacy, bribery, and bluff kept the PCA out of their business until it was too late: The world woke up one morning to find the <span style="font-style:italic">Sharpstone Cartel </span>everywhere. </p>

<p>As they consolidated their position, the clan began to simultaneously massage demand in their favour. They worked hard to make their products (still mainly diamonds but now all kinds of gems as well) the most desired icon of social standing and wealth. Then they began to interdict diamond supplies: Profitable mines were shut down to restrict supply, late convoys caused panic buying, rumours were quietly spread of shortages and that one day there might not <span style="font-style:italic">be </span>any more diamonds at all. Despite their recent consolidation this almost beggared the cartel yet again. </p>

<p>The crowning glory of their plan was when the Harmonium finally began to close in on the truth of their operation. Zamuz took full responsibility for the actions of his clan. He went to trial and was found guilty, and served thirty years in a workhouse for his deeds. But before the trial was over, Zamuz made sure to make it known that he’d only done it to try and protect his fellow clan-members against what he feared was the end of their business; before the diamond supply ran out completely. When this information became public, demand (and prices) soared even higher.</p>

<p>In recent decades the Sharpstone Cartel has recovered their costs and more besides, becoming rich and powerful enough to dominate the jewel-trade. With wealth to spare they have made amends to the Harmonium through large donations to the Provender and other charitable works, as well as sweet words of contrition and constant pledges of support. Since then the cartel has never been anything less than rich and secure. Even with the OCA’s stabilising policies the price of gold, grain, and other staples fluctuate somewhat; but gems - and diamonds in particular – have continued to advance in price almost without exception, to the extent that even the Orthorian Central Authority has begun stockpiling these precious stones against leaner times. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Modus Operandi</span></p>

<p>The cartel’s position might seem unassailable, but the Sharpstones are still ruthless in maintaining their dominance of the trade. Nothing is allowed to threaten the supply; be it bandits, monsters, or unfriendly politicians. Mostly they work within the law – legal challenges, lobbying the government, and persuading local officials, as this is actually easiest with their mammoth wealth and influence. They’re not unwilling to embroil rogues and adventurers in subterfuge however, and have a relatively good reputation with the Freefolk as employers… but its well known that those who fail, betray them, or have their collar felt by the Hardheads will be swiftly eliminated. The Sharpstones are even more paranoid and controlling than the average cartel, but very generous to loyal and effective employees. </p>

<p>The colonies enjoy a slightly different modus operandi to Ortho proper. The cartel usually has influence in the colonial capitol and any significant mining areas, but local competition is often yet to be entirely eliminated or consumed. In some places the Cartel has a relationship of grudging cooperation, in other locales active sabotage and even open warfare goes on. Regardless of their general stance however, the competition is always watched for signs of weaknesses. Matters are generally left to each colonial office, and working practices follow the tone of local Harmonium forces.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Tool of the Trade</span></p>

<p>Wealth is the greatest asset of the Sharpstones, and their primary means to an end. They prefer to buy out or bribe those they can, but the Cartel’s various ‘barons’ aren’t allowed to spend outrageous amounts without results to show for it. Nevertheless the Sharpstone Cartel is synonymous with hiring only the best. In the past they have been good to the Freefolk, remembering their roots. Later generations have begun to view the Free as beneath them however, and the age-old alliance is slowly fading.</p>

<p>Orcs and dwarves still comprise the majority of the Cartel’s personnel (especially at higher ranks), but all races can be found as its agents and guards. Hrothgar’s great-granddaughter, Lucretia Teague (a half-orc) now holds his post as First Prince, but venerable dwarf Zamuz the Elder <span style="font-style:italic">still </span>retains his previous position as Master of the House after almost two hundred years in the job. Zamuz’s children all occupy senior positions in the cartel but the highest rank remains stubbornly occupied and resentment has been simmering for a long time.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Recent Activities &amp; Events</span></p>

<p>The Cartel’s primary interests at present are the development of Hazhkan, and their <span style="font-style:italic">Quiet War</span> in Han the Gem-Studded. Overarching these (and superseding them when necessary) is the constant mantra of <span style="font-style:italic">“Reliability, Stability, Profitability.”</span> All Sharpstone personnel are expected to promote utter reliability of their services (from the quality of the finest diamond to the standards of the lowliest Freefolk mercenary), the stability to the market (which in recent decades has become synonymous with the stability of the Pax Harmonium), and of course the constant and unending accumulation of wealth.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Han and the Quiet War</span></p>

<p>The Sharpestones’ rising fortunes were matched by increasing influence and power in the council chambers and corridors of Han the Gem-Studded. It was a savage - if subtle – fight, with no quarter asked or given by either side. The Great Houses of Han call this kind of conflict a <span style="font-style:italic">Quiet War</span>, and all sides restrain themselves somewhat to avoid overt trouble with the law. </p>

<p>The position of <span style="font-style:italic">Master House</span> belongs to Sharpstone now, but they are regularly challenged by an alliance of other nobles, who strive constantly to bring them down through political manoeuvring and sabotage. Freefolk agents, spies, and snakedancers are all in high demand.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">The Development of Hazhkan</span></p>

<p>The Sharpstone Cartel has a significant interest in the new Province of Hazhkan, which is overtaken its traditional holdings in Keln as the centre of diamond production. The range of mountains known locally as <span style="font-style:italic">The Sweating Peaks </span>(because of their swamp and rainforest-filled valleys) is now home to numerous gem mines and ‘venture towns’ set up and run almost exclusively by the Sharpstone Cartel. Often impoverished and isolated, the venture towns of Hazhkan have a reputation for lawlessness where life is cheap, tempers frayed, and violence the commonest answer in quarrels. In other places however, the Cartel’s influence is far more positive:</p>

<p>Keen to develop the Province’s infrastructure and continue the cartel’s good relationship with the OCA, the cartel is working hard to help bring the Way of Harmony to the wilds of Hazhkan. As well as sponsoring the Provender in Hazhkan’s towns and cities, and building ports for both ships and aerostats, the cartel also makes good use of its Freefolk connections: Sponsored explorers chart the jungles; venture companies open trade dialogue with local tribes; and hunters and prospectors are encouraged to seek adventure in the wilds. </p>

<p>Opinion is strongly divided in Hazhkan between those exploited by the cartel, and those who are benefiting from it.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">ADVENTURE HOOKS</span></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">“Prodigal Son”</span></p>

<p>Zamuz the Younger is an ambitious and avaricious dwarf finishing a five year sentence for illegal activities in Motmurk, although thanks to his business skills and generous Prison Tithe his sentence has hardly been onerous. From his cell he has planned his father’s overthrow. Upon his release, he hires a band of Free Folk and mercenaries to guard his person and perform “whatever needs be done” to ensure his succession to Master of House Sharpstone. He moves from the workhouse in Motmurk (where he was formerly a Provincial ‘Duke’ in the cartel) and then takes ship for Keln, gathering resources and supporters along the way - even stopping at the island of Durlig’s Exile to try an gain the Beholder’s support. Zamuz and his loyal children are determined to stop him; by politics and intrigue if possible, with steel if they must.

They threaten to sacrifice their prisoners if the ‘tears’ are not returned. </p>

He’s coy about the exact location until the PCs agree and admits that the job <span style="font-style:italic">“will exist in a grey area of the law.”</span> This is because the diamonds aren’t even on the Material Plane: They are on the Mountain of Ultimate Winter on the Plane of Ice, reached by a secret portal not yet reported by the cartel (the Duke promises to do this once the supply route is confirmed). The ‘diamonds’ in question are actually crystals of perfect clear ice - frozen thoughts, emotions, and memories that solidified and fell away from their owners in the supernatural cold. Armies of Frost Dwarfs, Remohaz, White Dragons, and servants of Achomental Lord Cryonax await them on the Mountain.</p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-weight:bold">The Seven Turtles Cartel</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Example of a cartel with criminal connections</span></p>

<p>The <span style="font-style:italic">Seven Turtles Cartel</span> of the Thaeran Isles straddles the line between a large venture company and a small cartel. Certainly it was once the former, but now its power has expanded throughout the Isles and the coasts of Theara. Their flag of seven golden turtles on a green field can now be seen flying from coastal ports and the masts of Thaeran junks throughout the region. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">History</span></p>

<p>The original Seven Turtles venture company is almost as old as the Pax Harmonium but for many years never amounted to more than labour gangs, river barges and fishing boats, and a handful of merchant ships. It was in essence a cooperative run by and for the local <span style="font-style:italic">lacerde </span>of the Seven Turtles Bay tribe. With the continual development of Pan Thaera in the Age of Harmony however, the venture company - and the illegal operations that take place alongside it - has flourished to hitherto undreamed of heights of power and wealth. </p>

<p>The Seven Turtles Bay tribe were once peons of the Thaeran Empire. Freed of their bondage by the victorious Knights of Harmony, they joined the Pax Harmonium but saw little harm in some quiet roguery on the side. </p>

<p>Despite their general acceptance of crime, the Turtles are mostly a responsible organisation: They practically built the modern-day town of Seven Turtles and the infrastructure that connects it to the rest of the world, and they are determined enemies of pirates and smugglers – or at least, of <span style="font-style:italic">other </span>pirates and smugglers. The <span style="font-style:italic">lacerde </span>consider this division between legal and illegal activities as perfectly fine and amicable. After all, what could be more ordered and lawful than the tribe running both sides of society? This way the whole tribe can benefit from the deal and everybody can trust each other to do their jobs, behave responsibly, and prosper. Allowing non-believers to control the underworld only creates division, so it’s practically the Way of Harmony, isn’t it? </p>

<p>For the Seven Turtles at least, this approach seems to work. They’ve dominated their town and surrounding waters for five centuries both inside and outside the law, yet things don’t necessarily run smoothly all the time:</p>

<p>During the Schism, the company took an officially neutral stance – at least as much as such things were possible in the Ortho wide conflict. Both its legitimate and criminal agents spied, privateered, and smuggled supplies for both sides. They also saw action against 'requisition ships' (privateers in all but name) who prowled contested waters looking to commandeer men and goods – and also served in that capacity for both Juhlienists and rebels; both sides declared the Turtles enemies at different points, but both were persuaded to work with them once more our of sheer necessity. As a consequence the cartel didn’t exactly have a shining reputation with the post-Schism government, but they did become known for looking after the ‘little people’ – the villages, fishermen, and freefolk of Thaeran waters. Many smaller associations joined with the Seven Turtles for protection during the war, and the increased resources allowed them to survive the conflict in tact. The company wasn’t about to let such assets return to independence afterwards, and were ruthless in enforcing the ‘loyalty’ of members gained during the war. Despite the bad feeling many newcomers had, the expansion of non-lizardfolk into the cartel proved integral to its further success. </p>

<p>The company has had its (sometimes severe) ups and downs, from Harmonium investigations to external underworld forces rising to challenge their dominance of Thaeran smuggling. The last danger to their rule was twenty years ago, when a particularly savage gang of Mer called the Long Coral Knife staked a claim on the Cartel’s home town. Local freeblade Sin Laah saw them off and made herself head of both the legitimate company and town’s underworld gangs. It’s a precarious position, not least because ‘Mother Turtle’ (as she’s known) has bound both halves of the cartel closer than they’ve ever been before.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Modus Operandi</span></p>

<p>The Seven Turtles Cartel are traders in simple goods like fish, shell, turtle meat, and whaling products. The Cartel’s merchant ships ply the Thaeran Isles carrying anything and everything – but mainly cartel goods rather than independent commissions. In these markets they are in direct competition with the Mer, but usually prefer to keep the rivalry ‘productive’ if not exactly friendly. In recent years Sin Laah has worked hard to try and bring more Mer into the cartel, both to ease general relations and get one up on the Mer companies. </p>

<p>The Seven Turtles Cartel still serves their namesake tribe, and even Sin Laah must answer to the tribal elders.  Generally they just count their tithe and leave her too it, however. Beneath the Princess herself are regional Barons (often Baronesses, as the cartel still operates with a strong bias towards matriarchy) who administer port enclaves or strings of villages. After them come individual cartel’s captains and other agents. The cartel is still small enough to administer things on a generally face-to-face level, and it’s not uncommon for even the lowliest members to get dragged before Mother Turtle for justice.</p>

<p>The cartel rarely controls individual fishing boats these days, preferring to make exclusive arrangements with whole villages to buy their catch and produce. Merchant ships are used to carry their goods; the balance of legal and criminal activities usually following the conscience of each crew. Most ships have a few personnel aboard who deal with any illegal activities on behalf of their captain, while some vessels are practically full time smugglers and privateers (and occasionally outright pirates). The cartel has a number of ships that maintain only a façade of merchant work and are in fact armed and equipped specifically to deal with any problems – up to and including Harmonium ships who stick their noses into the wrong cove or ship’s hold. Many of these are whaling ships, which use that pretext as an excuse to be armed. The Thaeran Provinces still sometimes offer bounties for known pirates, and many cartel ships turn a profit pirate and smuggler hunting as well – and naturally they concentrate their efforts on the cartel’s rivals.</p>

<p>The Seven Turtles control many coves and villages but none of the major towns and cities. In these places the cartel makes efforts to create enclaves by slowly buying out whole streets’ worth of businesses from which to base their operations. They fly the cartel’s green and gold flag proudly, an unmistakable signal as to whose turf visitors are walking onto. The cartel usually maintains premises in the Licensed Quarter as well, where its more nefarious clientele can meet.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Illegal Activities</span></p>

<p>For the good of the tribe and the peace and quiet of trade, the cartel involves itself in smuggling. Such things are inevitable, it rationalises. So if smuggling <span style="font-style:italic">will </span>happen, then surely its better if conducted peaceably and in an organised and responsible fashion. For the good of the Pax Harmonium, the cartel dirties its hands with numerous illegal activities - not that the Hardheads would approve.</p>

<p>Legal and illegal activities are run separately, but side by side in a mirror image of the cartel. Smuggling is the primary source of extra income, but rarely are whole cargoes made up of illicit goods. Most smuggling goes on under cover of legitimate work. The Turtles prefer ‘trading below the board’, as the saying goes: Mislabelling cargoes, bribing customers officers to overlook a percentage of their goods, ‘losing’ a few crates overboard (that are mysteriously found once the taxes are paid) and other sharp dealing. They concentrate their efforts on substances that are legal but disapproved of (and so taxed more) such as rum, vezum, Huq leaf, and pakari stimulant. In the local thieves tongue the disreputable part of their organisation is known as “in the turtle’s shadow” or simply as the Shadow Cartel.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Tools of the Trade</span></p>

<p>Lizardmen make up the majority of senior cartel membership, especially closer to home. The whole business is still run partly to fund the tribe. Other races can do well in the cartel and prejudice is minimal and based more on gender than race. As long as they’re happy with part of their profits going to the tribe, the Turtles will take anybody. Most of its members are merchant seamen of varying race and morality. Some are strictly honest, others totally corrupt; the tribe is happy to find the role that suits each member best.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div><span style="font-weight:bold">Sidebar: Sin Laah</span>
Unusually for the tribe, Sin Laah rules both the Seven Turtles and the shadow cartel – and is mayor of the lacerde’s home town to boot. Many people on all sides of the law feel that her powers should be split up, but her many allies (and especially Raef Ogrun and the Redfins) make overthrowing her impossible at present. See the ‘Seven Turtles Bay’ write-up for statistics and more information on Sin Laah.</div></p>

<p>The cartel usually keeps its criminal members at arms length, simply taking a cut of profits and offering protection as and when it’s needed. Most agents and enforcers are thugs using knives or the traditional tribal kukri, drawn from the most unscrupulous whaler and smuggling crews. This suffices for most purposes, but the shadow cartel also maintains contact with other underworld organisations, who supply them with specialists when necessary.</p>

<p>A few government personnel are on the shadow cartel’s books as well: Port officials, harbourmasters, pilots, customs officers, civil guards, and excise patrols. They receive a steady wage to look the other way when a Seven Turtles delivery comes in. Most notably amongst these corrupt officials is Raef Ogrun (<span style="font-style:italic">CG Ogre Bard 4</span>), Harbourmaster of Seven Turtles Bay and an otherwise committed member of the Harmonium. His persuasive powers have smoothed over many difficulties for the cartel since he came to power – unsurprising since he was sponsored through the College of the Choir by Sin Laah herself.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Recent Activities &amp; Events </span></p>

<p>The cartel’s ability to juggle legitimate and criminal enterprise is under threat. Obscurity was the cartel’s previous primary defence against discovery, but they are now so large and prosperous that inevitably their work touches the OCA and the Harmonium. Their towns (especially Seven Turtles itself) are growing so much that they are becoming part of the infrastructure of the Isles and the global economy of Ortho. In the Pax Harmonium such things are not allowed to exist without scrutiny. A big decision is facing Sin Laah and the tribal elders: Sever ties with the underworld, suffering economic losses and risking chaos in the Turtle’s Shadow – or continue with the tribe’s illicit activities and risk dooming them all?</p>

<p>See the entry for Seven Turtles Bay for more adventure hooks involving the cartel.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">"Turtle Town"</span><br />
The PCs are contracted by the townsfolk of a small Thaeran port. The cartel has been muscling in on various businesses, trying to create a new enclave. Bribes and promises have turned to threats, and the townsfolk fear that if they refuse to be bought out by the cartel, its thugs will soon resort to violence. </p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">"Employee Relations" </span><br />
Sin Laah contacts the PCs. One of her captains is behaving a little too blatantly and must be dealt with. The man is a smuggler and pirate who needs to be lost at the bottom of the sea before the Harmonium get their hands on him. She cannot deal with him internally, but as outsiders the PCs can do the dirty work.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">"Shark Attack"</span><br />
The PCs are approached by a <span style="font-style:italic">Redfin </span>(Sahuagin Harmonium officer), who orders them to infiltrate the shadow cartel and find proof of its wrongdoing – and specifically that local Redfins may be involved in corruption.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">"Merder Most Foul"</span><br />
Several Mer have been murdered and the cartel is being blamed. Many people suspect that arguments over the contested pearl beds are responsible, although a few people suspect that the Long Coral Knife have returned. Are the Turtle’s Shadow responsible – or is some third force involved?</p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px">The Tortuga Venture Company of Xaric</span></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">An example of a small venture company</span></p>

<p>The kobold known as Zambo is something of a celebrity. He can be seen plying the Knights’ Road up and down Xaric (and occasionally beyond), marching at the stately pace of the unusual mounts that have given him fame. Many laugh but Zambo remains proud: He operates a caravan made up exclusively of <span style="font-style:italic">Tortugons </span>– Dire Tortoises.</p>

<p>Many find his operation humorous, as the tortoises are slower than most humanoids and considerably slower than most other mounts. Nevertheless, their notoriety seems to compensate for their speed and the Tortuga Venture Company of Xaric always seems to have enough business aplenty. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">History</span></p>

<p>In his youth, Zambo was an animal handler at The Golden Tower, one of Three Rivers’ most prestigious inns. He learned his trade direct from legendary kobold masterhandler Xinxano, dealing with all manner of mounts, familiars, pets, and animal companions. As a result, Zambo is passingly familiar with just about every creature you can ride, harness, or tame. Tales of the Freefolk inspired Zambo leave his job and travel the roads of Xaric. As a poor kobold however, he couldn’t afford the horses or ponies required by most venture companies. Nor did he have the resources to tame horses, so he settled on more sedate animals – Xaric’s enduring but easygoing tortuga, caught and trained by his own hand. </p>

<p>People laughed but the image stuck of an outlandish kobold adventurer upon a giant tortoise, head wrapped in a trailing kaftan, long goad in his hand, and a broad smile on his canine features. He’s made a more than decent living over the years from this memorable image, and Zambo now employs a several other kobolds as well. <br />
 <br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Modus Operandi</span></p>

<p>Zambo and three other handlers ride dire tortoises (tortuga - sing. tortugon) and pile packs upon another eight or nine beasts, making the caravan usually about twelve mounts long. Despite their lack of speed the tortuga can take an immense load without slowing, and can plod along for many hours later than other pack animals. <span style="font-style:italic">“Slow and steady!” </span>Zambo assures his critics. <span style="font-style:italic">“They might not be as fast as ponies but they never ever stop – so neither do we! They’re cheap feed, easily housed, never irritable, and as enduring as the Pax Harmonium itself. And who’d want to rush in all this nice weather and fine countryside?”</span></p>

<p>Zambo’s activities stay within the law <span style="font-style:italic">(“we could hardly make a run for it, now could we?”)</span> but otherwise he has an anything goes approach to life. He carries passengers (especially Freefolk who enjoy the novelty) and just about anything that can fit on a dire tortoise’s back. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Tools of the Trade</span></p>

<p>The company uses a simple mix of resources: Tireless giant tortoises, Zambo’s personal talents, and a can do attitude. Most of his major stopovers now provide stabling for his mounts, usually provided by workers from local kobold clans that Zambo trained himself. His workers are drawn from a variety of clans and he’s not usually prejudiced against other clans as many kobolds are. The staff remains small however, and most trouble is sorted out directly by Zambo himself – by words or a few prods of his goad.</p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-weight:bold">The Rosesail Freedom Venture Company</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">A large venture company with internal divisions</span></p>

<p>The most prestigious venture company of the modern age was born from the chaos of the great schism, and the desperate alliance of former enemies. To the present day the company shows divided loyalty and cracks in its united facade. Some of its members embrace the very best philosophies of the Pax Harmonium but others exploit the system for their own unscrupulous benefit.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">History</span></p>

<p>The Rose Sail venture company were a band of Julhienist Freefolk who did their duty for the Composer’s forces as spies, smugglers, and agents. They served with honour and distinction throughout the War of the Schism, and the reputation of the Rose Sails and people like them did a lot to turn around the government’s opinion of the Freefolk. After the war it was among the first companies to ask for official recognition and to fight for the rights of Freefolk in general.</p>

<p>The Freedom Company were a Thaeran outfit who specialised in mercenary work, smuggling, and piracy. They thrived as privateers and saboteurs during the war and had a reputation for effectiveness - if not for honour – which equalled that of the loyalist Rose Sails. By the conflict’s end they were a large and powerful fleet, but they were also on the losing side and desperate to appease the new Council of Ortho. </p>

<p>In the wake of the great strife, the pirate lord of the Freedom Company, a man named Suleb Bar, approached the captain of the Rose Sail Venture Company with a proposal: That the two groups join forces: The Freedom Company would turn legitimate, purge their wilder elements, and accept the rule of the law and the OCA. In exchange the Rose Sails would use their influence to mollify the government and together the two groups could dominate the venture company trade throughout Thaera’s Provinces. Swayed by pleas of “for the good of the Freefolk” Captain Bathemus Rakham (Iathran exile, captain of the Rosy Dawn, and master of the company) acquiesced and took the smugglers under his wing.</p>

<p>It was not an easy partnership.</p>

<p>First the Freedom Company had to purge itself of overt criminals and rebels, often turning on fellow pirates who had been close allies during the war. Many couldn’t forget or forgive this forced treachery against their own kind. Those turned upon certainly didn’t - Six years later the last band of pirates hunted down Bathemus’s ship and murdered both him and his crew. It was too late to prevent the new company’s formation however, and the ‘Rosesail Freedom Venture Company’ made sure that these rebels suffered for what they’d done. Bathemus’ son Kaito took mastership of the combined company, marrying the granddaughter of Suleb Bar to seal the alliance.</p>

<p>From the Reconciliation onwards, the Rosesail Freedom Venture Company has had a close working relationship with both the Harmonium and the OCA. At first they exploited the contacts they’d made during the war and later they courted both groups for the protection and prosperity that cooperation brought. Many Freefolk saw them as ‘selling out’ but the venture company prospered while many groups who insisted on maintaining their independence did not.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Modus Operandi</span></p>

<p>The Rosesail Freedom Venture Company operates mainly in Thaeran waters, including out of the way places and backwaters where few Harmonium troops visit. They are primarily traders, but also provide the traditional Freefolk services of hired muscle and unofficial diplomats. They have a reputation as “Harmonium adventurers” that has far more in common with their planar counterparts than the reality of life on Ortho.</p>

<p>Their reputation is not all good however. A fair proportion of its captains and agents are ruthless profiteers who utilise Harmonium training and contacts to pressure those they deal with. Smaller ventures and independent Freefolk are not welcome within reach of such people, and more than a few times there have been accusations of threats, extortion, and other racketeering. </p>

<p>In the out of the way backwaters of the Thaeran Isles, sometimes the RSVC is virtually all the laws there is. Its personnel provide security for isolated governours and officials, volunteer to support excise forces, and deal with all manner of ‘problems’ unofficially for the OCA. This has brought them considerable support over the years, as Thaera is still a Province in which many distrust both the Harmonium and the world government. RSVC is an acceptable alternative to many. To others however, the company has become just another arm of the regime.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Tools of the Trade</span></p>

<p>The Rakham family has run the company for four hundred years. Although originally natives of Iathra who fled the desolation of Alzrius, they retain their family name but are otherwise thoroughly native Thaerans. The folk of the former Empire of Chaos make up the majority of their members, but there is also a significant minority of northerner stock (mainly Iathran). True to the Way of Harmony’s philosophy however, they care relatively little for a member’s race. For the last hundred years they have even enjoyed a strong working relationship with the Sahuagin.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div><span style="font-weight:bold">Sidebar: Rakham’s Daughters</span>
	
The last unifying master of the company was Hanse Rakham, who was survived by his twin daughters, Pax, and Amalthia. Although identical in appearance, the girls are as different as night and day and bitter rivals for their father’s throne. Pax is reputed to be a hard, humourless and vengeful woman, not afraid to take up a sabre (or put a dagger in your back, her sister claims) to ensure that the more wild and lawless captains win the day. Amalthea meanwhile appears more demure, preferring to let charm and diplomacy (and conniving and poison, her sister claims) to increase the company’s influence with the Harmonium and OCA. The polarising factions within the RFVC each have a daughter to champion their cause.</p>

<p>Both Rakham daughters were married previously, but both husbands died under mysterious circumstances; and each daughter accused the other of murder at the time. This has not discouraged suitors however: many men – young and old – are seeking the hand of these prestigious women. </div></p>

<p>The company has four dozen ships at its disposal, mainly merchantmen and the occasional cutter escort vessel. Its personnel are primarily traders, although each ship or camp has several specialists it can use to solve problems when marines alone can’t do the job. There are a relatively high proportion of such personnel in the company, which has always recruited heavily from the world’s Freefolk – although this tradition has fallen off somewhat as the company becomes more involved with the state. These days it prefers to train its own forces, especially former Harmonium personnel. Friction between ‘real soldiers’ and the adventurers is a common tension, both on individual vessels and between rival ships. </p>

<p>The company’s heraldry is gold upon a deep red field. The letters R and F flank the spire of an inverted Y shape, a split arrow pointing upwards (indicating two ways becoming one), beneath which are the letters ‘VC’ for venture company. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Recent Activities &amp; Events</span></p>

<p>These days the RFVC is hardly considered ‘Freefolk’ at all. They’re far too comfortable with the authorities for most adventurers to trust them. For good or ill the company is often the nearest thing to law in the isolated isles, and many of its captains have decided to take advantage of this. </p>

<p>The RSVC has recently been flexing its muscles, pushing its way into lawless hamlets and fishing ports to establish law and order alongside company stockades. Many on the wrong side of the law have found themselves facing RFVC personnel who aren’t afraid to break a few heads to get the job done. The company’s growing private army has political support and a large former Harmonium contingent – The remaining Freefolk are starting to feel marginalised, just as they did five hundred years ago in the rise of the Knights of Harmony. Unrest is brewing once again.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">ADVENTURE HOOKS</span></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">“Feud on the High Seas” </span><br />
The RFVC has begun to clash with the Seven Turtles Cartel, or more precisely with those who work in The Turtle’s Shadow. Well-armed merchantmen on both sides have begun to patrol the Thaeran straits looking for any excuse to strike at the opposition. Armed gangs prowl the docksides as well, and brawls are becoming knife-fights and almost open rioting. Plenty of work for freeblades in the fighting or for conscientious citizens who wants to stop it.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">“The Sons of Suleb Bar” </span><br />
A band of pirates has taken to attacking RFVC shipping, leaving few survivors. Bloodshed almost seems to be more important to them than booty. They call themselves the Sons of Suleb Bar and claim to be upholding the feud that began four hundred years ago during the Schism. </p>

<p>The Kugnut Cartel is the only major merchant organisation controlled by Ortho’s kobolds. They supply automatons and other industrial machinery across Xaric, Motmurk, and Keln. Their operations are also rapidly expanding to encompass the rest of Ortho and her colonies. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">History</span></p>

<p>Shortly before the War of Iron, a kobold called Kugnut Springjaw worked in a government research facility near Xelhone, perfecting the steam horses and other experimental technology. He did menial labour and testing, but like most kobolds he had an innate gift for machinery and tinkering. Also like most kobolds, he was underappreciated by taller, more book-learned researchers.</p>

<p>He worked for decades at the research house, from roustabout to greasedog to supervisor. In that time he studied – and according to popular legend, pilfered parts and plans for his own use. After twenty years of (sometimes explosive) experimentation in a dilapidated barn near his clan caverns, he produced Kugnut’s Automaton – an unreliable but still a working copy of the government steam horse.</p>

<p>Furore surrounded the machine’s release but the accusations of theft coincided with the opening salvoes of the War of Iron. The powers that be suddenly had bigger fish to fry and matter was shelved, never to be resolved. Kugnut made good use of the situation and supplied his steamhorse to various provender farms to ease the lack of manpower. Their numbers were small and some machines weren’t that much of a help, but the gesture earned his venture company the good graces of the government - although to this day the Kugnut cartel has a reputation for shoddy work and cutting corners. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Modus Operandi</span></p>

<p>From these beginnings the Kugnut Cartel grew, and it is still growing today. The Cartel is actually a cooperative, dividing profits among its members, who stem from numerous kobold clans. They prefer to employ their own race rather than others, which is earning it increasing criticism as it expands. Kugnut’s heirs however, claim that they are merely aiding their race’s spread and integration with wider Ortho society. ‘Head office’ for the cartel remains the traditional clan lands where Kugnut originally built and experimented, but it is now a thriving village employing hundreds of kobolds. Traditional clan rivalries are discouraged but rampant anyway; it’s not uncommon to see rival squads of engineers screaming at each other over accusations of theft or sabotage.</p>

<p>Cartel representatives are ardent salesmen and it’s a common joke that they sell goods more by constant yapping annoyance than negotiating skill. Despite this and the relative unreliability of Kugnut machinery, cartel personnel and devices are a common sight in both rural and urban areas. Although steamhorses are still their primary trade, the cartel now produces automatons and various other machines as well. </p>

<p>Kugnut Cartel devices are less reliable than average, but they are more numerous and more cheaply bought or rented, and there’s no denying the skill of their engineers. This image is so pervasive that the cartel has even contributed a new phrase to the common tongue: Useful but unreliable devices are now referred to as being “a bit of a Kugnut.” The current masters of the cartel would like to change this opinion, but with typical kobold mentality would rather have a dubious reputation on everyone’s lips than a good reputation known only to a few.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Tools of the Trade</span></p>

<p>Salesmen-operators travel the country with their machines and teams of engineers. Most often they hire their services for days or weeks, but also try to persuade local dignitaries to invest in the purchase of an automaton or a long-term contract. Agents essentially pay the cartel for the rights to a local franchise, paying a portion of their profits to the group.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div><span style="font-weight:bold">Sidebar: “It’s a bit of a Kugnut”</span>Kugnut devices are a little more unreliable than the official OCA and private company versions – but they are also cheaper. Such items can be bought at 20% less than standard price (and often a lot less paperwork), but the DC of any repair or operate rolls is increased by 2pts.</p>

<p>The typical Automaton Ox operator is a kobold Expert of around 3rd level (Craft: Automaton +10, including racial bonus and Skill Focus feat). He typically travels with 1d6 greasehounds (Expert 1, skill +6), who also double as guards.</div></p>

<p>As well as their novel approach to engineering, cartel members have an often undeserved reputation and scavengers and thieves – often carried from old prejudices against the kobold race. The kugnut cartel has a reputation for using parts other manufacturers throw away, and kobold ‘junk merchants’ regularly sell odd nuts and bolts and other supplies to the cartel for a handful of copper coins. </p>

<p>This reputation also extends to other business practices. The cartel has been accused several times of violating patent laws, attempting to bribe OCA officials regarding permits and new licenses, and the general use of ‘sharp practice’ to gain the edge on their competition. The validity of these claims vary from place to place, but the reputation follows them everywhere.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Recent Activities &amp; Events</span></p>

<p>The Kugnut Cartel’s latest expansion is into the aerostat business. Although they own no actual vehicles, kobolds are often the favoured employees of aerostat captains. They’re hardworking, technically adept, agile, and above all small and light – important considerations to profit-hungry skyship captains. Kobolds are now a common sight in the aerostat industry, not just as sailors but as stewards and porters as well. For many kobolds, this is their first chance to see the wider world and the profession is proving very popular indeed.</p>
