         <p>great stuff - funny you mention the Count as tightly wound, in that I see the Morgenstein as having a weird dark humor about his endless wars with the crazier walkers.</p>

<p>have we seen this Multiverse of animated constructs before? in any case i am curious about it, hoping to see a writeup!</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Thanks for the kind words. To answer your question, we have not seen this particular multiverse before - this little story was a break from the writeup, which I hope to finish soon.</p>

<p>As far as Olmina's impression of Count Morgenstein goes, I was imagining her as somewhere in the bottom tier of wheelwalkers - certainly a powerful force by the standards of planars or primes, but essentially an errand-runner in the grander scheme of things. So the concerns of characters like the Count or the Architects are a little baffling, and she suspects it would do all of them well to just relax a bit.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Heh, I found it funny because looking at what I had written the Count does come off as pretty dour. What I was getting at was laughing at myself. </p>

<p>Excited for your write up. I have some ideas jiggling in my brain but need some time for them to ferment. Might throw up some fun parallels though.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Crazy you should mention this - there was a bit of Alice in there, in the arrival in Elysium. Just thinking about less-than-dignified arrivals in strange lands...Alice getting rightside-up and straightening her dress with a <cite>harrumph</cite>.</p>

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Taking a break from this, but I thought this might be useful for some folks. I've done my best to capture the essence of each parallel: </p>

<p>Parallel I - Inner to Outer, as Below So Above:  A forest Sigil, cast in moonlight. The city is tended by Silver Walkers, who harvest the dream fruits of trees feeding on the city’s inhabitants.  Beyond the city, the Outer Planes have been conquered by the elementals, with only pockets of resistance opposing them. (Sciborg2)</p>

<p>Parallel II - The Tripartite Sigil is the Engine of Modernization:  Sigil in three parts: Wei La - The City of Kites and Lanterns (emerald, jade and green steel); Kzra  - The City of Bones and Bloodlines (mausoleums and undead); Illianda - The City of Waters and Wines (canals and steam and fortune).  The planes beyond these three cities use an incredible amount of magic-technology. (Sciborg2)</p>

<p>Parallel III - The Dead City, the Missing Lady: Sigil is shattered, though the now-mad dabus still try to attend the city.  Following the city’s ruin, a portal storm scattered the races of the planes to the prime worlds.  Factions are hunted as scapegoats for the destruction of Sigil by the exemplars of this parallel.  (Sciborg2)</p>

<p>Parallel IV - Where Quiet and Wild Reign: Sigil is vacant, though still attended to by the dabus.  Virtually all sentient life here is absent.  Those few who are left are asleep and cannot be awoken.  Overgrown ruins dominate the landscape of both the Primes and Planes. (Sciborg2)</p>

<p>Parallel V - Where Rivers Overflow: Ma’at floods Sigil in this Parallel, and the rest of the Outer Planes are mostly submerged by Oceanus, Ma’at and Styx.  Many Prime worlds also reflect this flooding.  Bridges, dirigibles and submersibles dominate the landscape. (Sciborg2)</p>

<p>Parallel VI - Sigil is for Lovers: Roses bloom across a greener Sigil.  There are an abundance of gods of Love across the Outer Planes, and romantic dramas play out between exemplars.  Heroic quests on Prime worlds are done to win the hand of a potential mate. (Sciborg2)</p>

<p>Parallel VII - It's All Hinterlands Here: A Wild West Sigil is filled with saloons and gunsmiths.  Backed with six-shooters, Harmonium guards keep the peace throughout the city.  The Outer Planes are divided into just the Upper, Lower and Concordant Opposition planes.  The Inner Planes war amongst themselves for either unity or total domination. (Sciborg2)</p>

<p>Parallel VIII - A Conflict of Empires: Sigil is home to refugees from across the planes, and would-be instigators are dealt with swiftly. All of the planes are war zones, and the once great cities of the exemplars lie in ruins. (Sciborg2)</p>

<p>Parallel IX - The Triumph of Celestial Bureaucracy: Temples and offices dominate this parallel’s version of Sigil.  The Harmonium is the dominant faction throughout the planes. The Planes of Conflict lean heavily towards Law, while the Planes of Chaos seem faded and ghostly. (Sciborg2)</p>

<p>Parallel X - The Gilded Darkness: Though Sigil’s beauty and prosperity is funded by both Paradise and Perdition, the celestials of this parallel are as evil as their counterparts in the Lower Planes.  Primes seek to escape an afterlife of torture by transferring their souls into gems, to be stored for eternity.  The Inner Planes remain distant and neutral, though (understandably) distrustful of the goings on of the Outer. (Sciborg2)</p>

<p>Parallel XI - The Sylvan Battleground: Sigil, resplendent in green and crystal, sits in perpetual twilight.  Spires dominate the city’s skyline.  While other wars continue on, the Outer Planes are dominated by a conflict between Seelie and Unseelie courts.  Prime worlds have seen an influx of forests and sylvan creatures. (Sciborg2)</p>

<p>Parallel XII - The Nascent Dream: Sigil is a city of scholars, dominated by the Mercane and Zodar.  Outside the city, everything is a dreamscape, with cities and landscapes rising out of, and falling back into, Dream Time. (Sciborg2)</p>

<p>Parallel XIII - The Waters, the Land and the Crown: Known as The Crown, the Sigil of this parallel is a ring castle the circumscribes the entire spire.  Positive, Negative, Fire, Water, Earth, and Air are the only Inner Planes.  The Outer Planes are an infinite expanse of islands varying in size, with the Spire always seeming to rise out of the waters somewhere on the far horizon. Each island either leans towards an alignment or hosts a Power. (Sciborg2)</p>

<p>Parallel XIV - The Aftermath of the Sun War: This much colder Sigil is caught in an unending night, bathed in a sourceless moonlight.  While many planes are home to charred landscapes, Solar Gods are, for the most part, absent from this parallel.  The absence of a sun on many Prime worlds has led to their freezing and the expansion of Cryonax’s domain of Ice on the Inner Planes.  (Sciborg2)</p>

<p>Parallel XV - The "Triumph" of Vecna:  Visions of Vecna dominate the dreams of many across this parallel, and many wars are fought in his name.  In Sigil, the factions take a back seat,  Vecna’s followers have transformed the city into a necropolis, though all must still abide the rules set down by The Lady.  (Sciborg2)</p>

<p>Parallel XVI - The Rilmani Get Serious: The Rilmani maintain Balance absolutely throughout all the planes – Outer, Inner and Prime - in this parallel.  Each victory turns into a defeat.  Good fortune for you is balanced by misfortune for others who may be innocent of any wrongdoing.  None are safe from their actions, whether Prime or Power.  (Sciborg2)</p>

<p>Parallel XLII - The Multiverse of the Five Spheres: Sigil exists here much as it does in the Multiverse Prime.  Rather than the familiar concepts of Good, Evil, Law, Chaos and Balance, this parallel utilizes Matter, Time, Thought, Energy, and Entropy, leaving the sentients of this parallel to suss out their own moral compass. An infinite number of lesser Outer Planes extend outward from there.  (ripvanwormer)</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Great summary Wicke!</p>

<p>Palo, I would love to see a Wonderland Parallel. Also looking forward to the one atomicb mentioned, the parallel dominated by constructs. (The guardinal in your story was an excellent touch, left me wanting more and made me laugh: "Welcome to the bold new afterlife - Hurrah.")</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Personalities: The Misbegotten Hallowed of Parallel X (Thanks Wicke for Ease of Reference!)</p>

<p><em>"In Darkness our world in stupor lies,
Yet dotted everywhere,
Ironic Points of Light flash out wherever the Just exchange their messages..."
 -Auden, 'September 1st 1939'
</em></p>

<p>In the Gilded Darkness of <a href="forum/enumerating-parallel-multiverses_.html#comment-62671">Parallel X</a>, the celestials and the fiends differ more in means and appearance than in goals. The Upper Planar exemplars here torture petitioners, driving them mad until finally their minds snap and finally they are fit to join the choirs and hosts.</p>

<p>Yet, even here, there is Good and where its Light leads these angels fear to tread. Perhaps even more terrifying are those mysterious yet familiar reflections, those angels who shine with the true purity of True Good.</p>

<p>Exactly who the Misbegotten Hallowed serve is unclear, since the "good" powers here are in on the conspiracy of the angels. It is claimed these horrifying (to the false angels and fiends) Others come from some other dimension, perhaps from another parallel or a place of untrammeled Good that exists as part of the Metaverse. Yet there are Swimmers of the Song who say the symphony of these beings is at one with that of Parallel X, that they are in fact native to that Multiverse.</p>

<p>These true angels rarely speak, usually acting to make sure certain events take place at the right time - including events on other parallels. When in disguise they can appear as mute mortals or celestials, but their true forms seem to those worn by celestials in the Primordial Age, celestials such as the priminals and the architects of Pelion's ruins...save none can be sure as witnessing these forms is witnessing a vision, a dream that makes you want to <a href="http://shakespeare.mit.edu/tempest/tempest.3.2.html">"cry to dream again."</a></p>

<p>At times they will appear without rhyme or reason to the false celestials gilded in lies, and then vanish in a flash of golden sunlight...and tortured petitioners vanish with them, taken to True Good knows where...</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Here are the rest so far.  XII was listed twice so the number count was off by one.  Also, I'm going to hold off on doing up atomicb's world to see if he wants to write up anything more for it:</p>

<p>Parallel XVII - The Ocean Foundations of Serpents: A parallel dominated by a pair of oceans: the Ocean of Silver and the Ocean of Ether.  Where they touch, dreams form and allow passage between the two.  On the surface of either Ocean, lying coiled like great wheels, are the Albino and Jet Cobras, respectively.  On the back of the Albino, exemplars build their kingdoms.  On the back of the Jet, the elementals wander. On their hoods, lie this parallel’s version of Sigil.  Where Albino’s Sigil is silver and Light, Jet’s Sigil is Darkness.  A single Prime world is rumored to exist somewhere in the region of Dreams. (Sciborg2)</p>

<p>Parallel XVIII - Unnamed:  The Powers of this parallel created no mortal followers.  They pursue relationships, arguments and battles between themselves, apparently not needing mortal belief to sustain them.   The Outer Planes boast no exemplar races as well.  Sigil stands vacant, except for the Lady who wanders an untouched city.  The first wheelwalkers to encounter this parallel were mistaken for gods and were later treated as mere curiosities when their mortal status was discovered. (Jem)</p>

<p>Parallel XIX - Whispers On Your Shoulder: Sigil exists as a jet crystal city flowing on the inside of a crystal shell.  Spelljammers fly through the vastness of wildspace.  There are only three planes in this parallel: Prime, with Paradise and Perdition echoing the conditions of each prime world.  Whenever a mortal is born, they’re assigned one fiend and one celestial, who act as (unasked for) advisors and councilors.  Those who align themselves with Order, Chaos or Balance and avoid any leanings towards Good or Evil, end up becoming elementals or are reincarnated. (Sciborg2)</p>

<p>Parallel XX - Spokes In The Cosmic Wheel: Sigil is not a torus in this parallel, but instead a multitude of spokes emanating out from a central point.  The Lady stands at the center and watches all.  Rather than directly connecting two points, portals here lead into extra-dimensional passages.  The conditions of these passages is never the same between voyages, and records seem to indicate that using the passages has been getting riskier and riskier over the years. (Eldersphinx)</p>

<p>Parallel XXI - Promise Of The Infinite: Sigil is ever changing in this parallel, appearing as a shining city of marble one day and a dank and fetid warren the next.  The Lady is as mutable as the city, potentially appearing as anyone or anything.  All sapients of this parallel are born human and can gradually transform into any other form, including Powers, through any means one can conceive of.  Death isn’t permanent here, though trauma can strip away memories, power and everything else that may matter. (Eldersphinx)</p>

<p>Parallel XXII - The Lady is Made of Sugar and Spice...and knives: Gingerbread houses and gumdrop architecture dominate this Sigil.  Any insects or vermin that try to enter this version of Sigil are immediately flayed, though sapient versions are tolerated.  The landscape of each Outer Plane reflects a candyland vision, while the Inner Planes reflect the ingredients used to create the candy. (Sciborg2)</p>

<p>Parallel XXIII - The World Tree and the Cosmic Web:  Yggdrasil rises in place of the Spire in the Outlands.  Sigil, rather than a city, exists as a great web in Ygg’s branches.  Spiders, rather than dabuses, attend the web-city.  Exemplars and planted trees exude matter from their home plane into foreign locales, which eventually “terraform” the landscape.  This has left the Outer Planes in a state of disarray, where one can find patches of Heaven in the depths of Hell, and vice versa.  The Inner Planes consist of the planes of Matter, Magic and Ether. (Sciborg2)</p>

<p>Parallel XXIV - The Roads through Stardust and Void: Sigil is a seven-sided band around the Spire, with a separate district corresponding to each band: Districts of the Dead, of Secrets, of Gold, of Ink, of Spit and Papyrus, of Steam and Gears, and of Whistled Symphony.  Prime worlds here are separated by only Wildspace.  Only one plane surrounds the Prime, a great void crossed by Roads of Good, Evil, Law, Chaos and Balance, joining together islands with fey, divine, fiendish, elemental or aberrant inhabitants. (Sciborg2)</p>

<p>Parallel XXV - Spheres within spheres: The city of Sigil turns within the outer shell of its torus underneath a glassed-in arc above. The Spire is the cable of a space elevator that connects it to the Prime below and the Outer Realms above.  The Prime Material is the inner surface of a Dyson sphere.  At the center of the sphere lies a heart of elemental Fire, while realms of Water and Air pass through the space above the inner surface.  The Outer Realms are organized according to three axis: Good/Evil, Law/Chaos, Static/Dynamic. (Jem)</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Parallel XXVI - Petitioner Perfection</p>

<p><cite>The mimir and monocle of remembering worked just fine, though the recorder stone turned out to be unusable. It works fine now - maybe it doesn't travel so well. In any case, I've got plenty of good stuff for you. Organizing it all currently, but here are some choice bits in the meantime.</cite></p>

<p>"What's going on here? Primus lied. That's what's going on here. Not to say he isn't the divine embodiment of law and order and blah blah blah, but underneath it all...he wants. Just like the rest of us. And so he lied. Not even the greater powers suspected Primus would be anything but straight with them and all of a sudden everyone is on board with this crazy plan and I'm picking up shifts in a woodshop, supervising <cite>dolls who put together dolls</cite>. It's like a backwards cannibalism fairy tale. I swear, I hit my head on the ceiling at least four times an hour. This morning a half-dozen of the things hugged me on the street and told me that it was the most beautiful day since tomorrow. <cite>What?</cite> I don't know if I can take it anymore. Bartender, another one of these please! Hell, make it five since you're pouring."</p>

<p>- anonymous cervidal, the City of Stars (identify withheld upon request)</p>

<p>Odin: But mortal belief is the fount of our power! What use do we have for your mindless automata?<br />
Primus: Mortal belief, of course! But on our planes and in our realms, wouldn't we be better served by petitioners who more perfectly embodied our ideals and philosophies? Nanoo nanoo.<br />
Odin: Nanoo nanoo indeed! Well put, my friend!</p>

<p>.......</p>

<p>Primus: You are so talented. Those flesh bags out there must really chap your hide.<br />
Hephaestus: They make me so crazy!</p>

<p>- Excerpts from Act I, Scene III of 'The Great Pretender' by Elax Ellwinder</p>

<p><cite>Dear Nebu:</cite></p>

<p><cite>Please refer to the following regarding future exploratory assignments: </cite></p>

<p><cite>Is the oeuvre of Elax Ellwinder involved?</cite></p>

<p><cite>If yes, then I am afraid I have a previous engagement to make love to a yugoloth on the sun.</cite></p>

<p><cite>Kisses,</cite>
   <cite>Olmina</cite></p>

<p>"True, there are those that question his motivations, but what Primus delivered was so much more than the powers had dared anticipate. Souls ascending from the prime provided the spark of animation to the constructs and merged with the plane immediately after! The powers were doubly enriched. It must have been intoxicating. I'm no fool, I won't look you in the face and deny that the new petitioners lack a certain amount of...depth in their personalities, but I challenge anyone to argue that it hasn't been a plum deal for all involved."</p>

<p>- Duke Lostgrove, ursinal author &amp; construct apologist</p>

<p>"Of course that duke won't speak to me, but maybe you can go back and ask him a few more questions. One, has he noticed there are maruts <cite>everwhere</cite>? Just hanging out, making sure everything is running smoothly, right? Come on, these aren't modrons! Maybe Primus thought 'Hey, I've got all these ten-foot death machines just gathering dust, I bet they'd really take to customer service!' Yeah, that sounds like some logical Primus thinking, huh? Give me a break. Something is coming. I can't prove it, but if you ask me I think Primus has a switch. He's got a back door into the heads of every Petitioner 2.0 out there, and one day he's going to turn them all into pictures of perfect order and all of the outer planes are going to slide into Mechanus. No, I can't prove that last part is even possible, but do you want to find out?"</p>

         <p>Parallel XXVI - continued</p>

<p><cite>Olmina, those were your</cite> organized <cite>notes? We really must have a long talk soon about the proper conduct of research. I had assumed the notebooks were in some kind of madcap fey shorthand until my brownie groundskeeper opined that it looked like common to him. "A festive interpretation of the printed word," I believe he called it.</cite></p>

<p><cite>I've only slogged through several planes worth of documentation thus far, but my investors are already asking for some crisp and classy summaries. Hopefully the following do the place justice - please let me know.</cite></p>

<p><strong>Arcadia</strong>
Long gone is the orderly agriculture of Arcadia, as the petitioners here do not mimic the old activities of the flesh as those on some other planes do, though first-time visitors are typically too absorbed by the skyline to comment on any missing orchards. Spires, impossibly thin for their height, soar up into the sky; some ascend straight upward while others blossom into perfectly ordered floral fractals. Closer inspection reveals that these towers are the petitioners of this plane. Countless thousands of featureless golden humanoids, climbing and balancing on one another, making a meditation on order and goodness from the struggle to maintain these elaborate formations. Their construction is so precarious that it would seem as if knocking them over should be child's play, though even considering such a thing seems to be a sure way to draw the attention of the local powers and their agents.</p>

<p>As on many of the lawful planes, constructs have found great favor with the deities here. Five gigantic glass lions with golden clockwork innards monitor Lu Hsing's realm, combining to form a gargantuan humanoid warrior on the rare occasions that the bureaucrat requires a particularly dramatic display of force. Schools of miniature sphinxes of bronze and stone patrol the skies of Heliopolis, exhausting travelers with questions and confounding riddles (though this is said to be far preferable to attracting the attention of an inquisitive obelisk).</p>

<p><strong>Baator</strong>
There are few planars more enthusiastic about this new order than the devils of Baator. Most Baatezu generals are tireless in their praise for the "new lemures," shambling assemblages of metal refuse, mechanical elements, and alchemical glassware bubbling with dark, noxious liquid. Few outsiders can discern any real distinction - to most they seem just as useless and wretched as before, but who is going to argue? Only recently have a select few begun ascending in the baatezu ranks, grotesquely transforming into ever more infernal machines. Many fiends have taken great issue with the promotion of these hellish constructs, but in light of the baatezu's (admittedly twisted) meritocracy it appears as if racial integration will win the day.</p>

<p>Baator is likely the most dramatically industrialized of the outer planes explored thus far - in addition to the sprawling lemure mills, the baatezu have invested mightily in facilities for research and development of new construct war machines, bizarrely  cosmopolitan places where the sight of a gnome arguing with an amnizu while a pentadrone looks on curiously is not particularly unusual (for a talented and ambitious maker of flexible scruples, the baatezu labratories are said to be the jobs of dreams).</p>

<p><strong>Ysgard</strong> 
Ysgardian petitioners are armored giants built for warfare, and a new petitioner could easily be mistaken for a warforged from the prime world of Eberron. Combat is their reason for being, and on some parts of the plane the distant racket of metal against metal is virtually constant. Each morning defeated petitioners rise from the piles of scrap to fight another day, though rarely in the form that they started. It's the odd Ysgardian that doesn't have a mismatched limb or two, and some older petitioners abandoned recognizable humanoid forms long ago. This resurrection appears to scramble what passes for the petitioners "minds" as well as their bodies - the sight of an iron giant berating a tree for its sniveling pacifism is not uncommon. Presumably these metal forms are as unfit for the water as they appear, as longships have taken to the skies, often featuring ranting, sword-waving petitioner figureheads.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Parallel XXVI - continued</p>

<p><cite>You have questions, I have answers.</cite></p>

<p><cite>Like the duke said, souls merge with the planes immediately. What he didn't say was that the constructs never go anywhere. Obviously 500 years of this regime is basically yesterday for plenty of the planars, but that's a lot of dead mortals. I flew from the City of Stars into the countryside and never quit running into packs of the little bastards. I spied on a group of a dozen of them for two days - they played games and sang songs and talked about their feelings, never stopping to rest or eat. At night they tried to tell ghost stories, but the scariest thing they could come up with was a grumpy dwarf. I can see why the guardinals are so depressed. Lots of planars have relocated, cutting the petitioners a wide berth, but the guardinals have stuck around. I think it's because the constructs are so childlike and insufferably good, which ironically is what makes them so unbelievably creepy and unbearable.</cite></p>

<p><cite>Yes, they are actually making these things, with a few exceptions. Workshops and forges and factories are everywhere. For all the divinity and metaphysics involved, this is an insane financial operation. Lots of honest work for anyone who wants it, but it boggles the mind where all the raw materials are coming from, infinite planes or no. Thuldanin is thick with baatezu and assorted other lower planars, dragging home as much junk as they can carry. Proxies of Elysium are finding exciting second careers as lumberjacks and those Arcadians are made of gold, for crying out loud! I'm pretty sure I heard Karagoth mentioned at a meeting of scrap barons in Void's Edge, which sounds like a fast coach to doomtown to me.</cite></p>

<p><cite>And speaking of Void's Edge, it may go without saying that the constructs make terrible slaves and even worse fiend food. So that can't end well.</cite></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Parallel XXVII - Where Nature Rules:</p>

<p>In this parallel, an enormous tree that stands in the place of the Spire.  Sigil is divided up into a string of scattered settlements more or less surrounding the base of the tree, and each is reminiscent of Faunel back in Multiverse Prime.  The few citizens who live in these settlements are rather reserved and clandestine, going about their public lives wearing animal masks of one kind or another, though behind closed doors and drapes, their masks come off.</p>

<p>On the surface, they seem rather barmy.  With their masks on, they imitate the behavior of the animals they're wearing.  However, after speaking at length with them, it seems that they wear their masks mostly to not draw attention to themselves from the native fauna, which seem to relentlessly attack all sentients they come across.  When asked about the Lady, the natives made some sort of hand gesture, swept it across their chests and refused to speak.</p>

<p>There are apparently only nine Outer Planes in this Wheel.  The names given are what the natives call them:</p>

<p>The Hive - Far from the squalor one might find in Sigil Prime, the Hive of this wheel seems to correspond to Mechanus.  The entire plane is filled with the buzzing of wasps, bees and the mass efforts of countless ants and termites.  Mounds and nests dominate the landscape, and what plants exist on this plane display flowers that this writer has never seen rivaled.  What can be seen of the land itself seems to be rather arid.</p>

<p>Aerie - Similar to Mount Celestia, this place is filled with mountainous terrain, with soaring heights and play host to numerous cliff dwelling birds.  The most majestic of these species are eagles, which local stories seem to cast in a similar light to celestials.</p>

<p>Elysian Fields - Gentle rolling hills and idyllic pastures dominate the landscape of this plane.  Vast herds of grazing animals roam the plains, shepherded by guard dogs which seem to act in the same role as Guardinals.</p>

<p>Arborea - Sylvan glades and dark forests.  Apparently home to unicorns and other mythical creatures.  Oddly, there didn't seem to be an equivalent to the Eladrin, nor anything resembling the usual nature spirits one would expect.  Warrants further investigation.</p>

<p>Chaos/The Wildlands - A confusing patchwork of landscapes and caverns.  Animals from this plane display the same sort of confusing patchwork.  There are enormous holes bored throughout, though nobody seemed to have any idea as to what may have caused them.</p>

<p>Nightmare - Corresponding to The Abyss, this plane is a twilight forest realm filled with deep shadows and dark caves.  This seems to be a plane of solitary predators who hunt down anything unfortunate enough to be caught in their path.  It's speculated that these predators take the place of the demons from Multiverse prime.</p>

<p>Fetid - An endless swamp filled with biting insects, leeches and crows.  There's apparently a species of hyena or jackal that roams these swamps.  By all appearances, they're helpful creatures and try to lead unaware visitors through the swamps, though there are numerous accounts of people coming to bad ends, sinking into quicksand or being lead directly into a river with a strong undercurrent.  These reports also seem to indicate that these animals like to sit and watch the individual struggle helplessly.  One can't help but think of the 'loths...</p>

<p>The Hunting Grounds - Taiga and tundra dominate the landscape here, where packs of hunting animals roam far and wide.  They've been observed working together diligently to bring down large prey or driving entire herds of animals off of cliffs.  Despite the effort it takes them to accomplish these feats, they often leave the fruits of their labor to rot.</p>

<p>Homelands - This parallel's equivalent of the Outlands.  Apparently, this plane is home to a fairly mundane cross section of animal and plant life, though creatures from all the planes have been observed crossing through the landscape here.</p>

<p>Regarding Petitioners: There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason behind where petitioners from Prime worlds show up.  Likewise, the form new petitioners take run the full gamut from all species, including sentient ones.  There's a group that calls themselves The Shepherds who roam the planes and try to save anybody who shows up in a humanoid form.  There's another group who opposes the Shepherds, and subscribe to a Survival of the Fittest philosophy when it comes to saving petitioners.</p>

<p>Regarding the Bloodwar (or it's equivalent): Occasionally, packs from the Hunting Grounds and shadowy predators from Nightmare encounter one another.  When they do, they fight until one side or the other is completely destroyed.  Woe to anything that's caught in the middle of these battles.</p>

<p>Regarding the Powers: It's not clear if there are any out and out <span style="font-style:italic">Powers</span> in this particular parallel.  Exemplars of a given species have been spotted however, and it's speculated that they're similar to the Beastlords of other parallels, and that these may take the role of Powers in parallel XXVII.</p>

<p>Not much is known about the Inner Planes of this parallel at this time, though rumors seem to indicate that it's well populated by refugee petitioners from the Outer Planes.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Parallel CII: The Duchess's Escape</p>

<p>Phaedra scowled. "So what you're saying, Wayf, is... this parallel is exactly the same as Multiverse Prime in every respect."</p>

<p>The Lonely Wayfarer seemed affronted by this suggestion. "Not at all, Phaedra! There are countless differences! Countless!"</p>

<p>Phaedra scanned the streets of the Clerk Ward. "It looks the same to me... same street names... same buildings... same proportion of races... oh! I know that guy!" Her face lit up as her eyes settled on a familiar face. "Iarmid!" she called out happily to the tall, pale aasimar. "How's my favorite masseur doing?"</p>

<p>The aasimar blinked at Phaedra curiously. "I'm sorry, miss, I don't recall you off hand... could you be Phaedros's sister?"</p>

<p>Phaedra's face fell as she came closer to the aasimar she had mistaken for her friend. The resemblance was uncanny, yes, but there was one significant difference: this aasimar was a woman. Phaedra sighed in world-weary exasperation and glanced sidelong at the Wayfarer. "Is this seriously how it's going to go, Wayf? I mean, seriously?"</p>

<p>The Lonely Wayfarer looked back guilelessly. "Why Phaedra, is there something wrong?"</p>

<p>Phaedra gave her companion a withering look. "A reverse-gender parallel? This is so cliche it doesn't bear mentioning. Why would you even bother?"</p>

<p>"Excuse me, miss," said the parallel Iarmid. "My Cipher instincts are calling me to some other seemingly random location. Perhaps later you'll tell me when your brother introduced you to me." She turned abruptly and trotted off.</p>

<p>"You have no spirit of scientific inquiry, Phaedra!" said the Wayfarer. "Just think of this parallel as the perfect control study to at last determine the true differences between the genders! An almost perfect mirror of Multiverse Prime, but with queens reigning instead of kings! Authors instead of authoresses! Goddesses instead of gods!"</p>

<p>"So what differences have resulted?"</p>

<p>"Almost none!" </p>

<p>Phaedra sighed. "Basically, then, the same arseholes as in our multiverse, but with different naughty bits?"</p>

<p>"Precisely," beamed the Wayfarer. "Oh, and the timeline seems to be about nine months behind. I blame all the maternity leaves."</p>

<p>Phaedra glanced at her fingers briefly, as if counting them. "That makes no sense!"</p>

<p>The Wayfarer shrugged. "Nonetheless, we are when we are." He pointed suddenly. "You see? That's Duchess Rowena Darkwood, about to rendezvous with the courier who will bring her the Labyrinth Stone, with which she foolishly hopes to overthrow the Lord of Pain."</p>

<p>"Wayf, look out!" Phaedra's eyes grew wide and fearful, but before her warning left her lips something cold and sharp pressed against the Wayfarer's spine.</p>

<p>"I don't think so, berk," said a gruff voice. The Wayfarer turned his head slowly. A large man with a scarred, craggy face, a square jaw, and a patch covering one eye stood at the other end of the sword. The one-eyed man grinned, showing bright white teeth. "We're rescuing her from fate, as well as any other parallel me that we can find." Behind him were others of similar build and appearance. One was maybe twenty years younger than the one with a sword. One wore wizard's robes. One had deep blue-green skin and webbed fingers. One was some kind of reptilian humanoid, though a patch covered one of his eyes.</p>

<p>The Rowan Darkwood holding the sword grinned again. There was a nasty edge to it as he spoke again. "And you're going to help us."</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Parallel CIII: Mad Queen Morwel</p>

<p>In this parallel, the latter years of the Dawn War between Law and Chaos went wildly differently. The exact chain of events that led to the timeline's divergence are disputed. Some say the Queen of Chaos was defeated by the slaad lord Ssendam, who took control of the hordes of Chaos only to be banished to Pandemonium by the unlikely alliance of her rival Ygorl and Queen Morwel of the eladrins. Others say the Queen of Chaos was slain by a marut suicide attack and Ssendam and Morwel seized control of the squabbling forces of Chaos as partners, and Morwel only accidentally became ruler of the united chaotic armies when she thwarted Ygorl's attempt to use the Spawning Stone to transform eladrins, slaadi, and obyriths alike into multicolored toads by gaining control of the Spawning Stone herself and transforming all the races into the superficial appearance of eladrins. </p>

<p>Regardless of how it happened, Morwel and her consort, a night-black eladrin called Ygorl, became the strange attractors around which all of Chaos whirled. The power of the Spawning Stone had granted all the warriors of discord the same tall, beautiful, vaguely elflike forms and mad glowing eyes, but driven the Queen of Stars irrevocably insane, as wildly chaotic and amoral as Ygorl and Ssendam. At the Wind Dukes' final stand on the plains of Pesh, Morwel brought the Spawning Stone with her and unleashed it on the forces of Law. Though the sundering of the Rod of Law opened a terrible chasm on the Plains of Pesh, the waves of Chaos from the Spawning Stone washed over the legions of order and they, too, were transformed into eladrin-like shapes, their minds made demented and strange... and Chaos swept across the planes unchallenged.</p>

<p>Eons later, there are only two outer planes remaining in this parallel. Arborea, a riot of strange, gargantuan, writhing trees of every color and variety, has merged with Limbo and absorbed every other outer plane from Gehenna to Acheron.  Baator is the last redoubt of Law, the sole remaining point of order in what was once the Great Ring. Nine Lords of Law rule Baator's nine layers: Zariel, Dispater, Mammon, Levistus, Belial, Lilith, Triel, Mephistopheles, and Primus, the One and Prime, who has bound his shining, androgynous body with chains of darkness and light to a vast, broken serpent that twitches at the bottom of the deepest trench in Nessus. The Lords of Baator are not evil, not entirely, but they are utterly without scruples as they do everything in their power to resist the still-growing Arborean forests and prevent them from consuming all. One former Lord of Baator, Gargauth the Traitor, has been exiled for conspiring with the enemy. Having made common cause with Chaos he has reaped the benefits: Morwel has given him an entire world to rule as he sees fit. This world, Abeir-Toril, Gargauth has remade in his own image, an ever-changing ruin dominated by dragons and grim cities.</p>

<p>One group has managed to escape Gargauth's shifting hellscape of a world: the illusionists of Nimbral, who have colonized a demiplane cloaked by magic, from which they can worship their goddess Leira and continue the battle against the conqueror of their world with lightning-fast raids on their pegasus mounts.</p>

<p>Sigil, in this parallel, is still a neutral ground filled with refugees from countless worlds, the Lady of Pain taking no sides in the radically lopsided war between Law and Chaos. What might happen to Sigil if the besieged plane of Baator should fall, however, is anyone's guess. Can her city remain neutral in a multiverse with only one side?</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Parallel L (50): The Shadowverse</p>

<p>This is a parallel of whispering shadows, though to each other they can scream and roar and can cut and bleed where visitors turn shadows into tatters with their attacks. To visitors they are all shades in ephemeral walls made of shadow stuff themselves. Note that visitors are slightly more "present" but also become shadows upon arrival. It is also hard to leave this place as one is not just realigning to another Multiverse but also returning to a more solid, if not more real, state of being.</p>

<p>Here shadow fiends are glowing silver spectres, and rule over the Lower Planes. The Lady remains her bladed self, a creature of color, yet here her "shadow" is of cold silver light as well.</p>

<p>The Outer Planes are in the same configuration as those of Multiverse Prime, and all of them are made from shadow stuff. In Limbo the shadows can take on colored hues, and thus fashion here revolves around the manipulation of chaos matter. The Grey Waste is a dead space, a wasteland with no emotion or color draining abilities.  The yugoloths are not to be found though their three towers stand complete but empty. This leaves Evil at a disadvantage, but the celestials have found that Ztefano is loose upon the Prime and much of their forces must contend with the corruption he has left in his wake. Apparently none knew just how much of the Primes he had ruined until after the Grey Waste was scoured of its Evil essence...a plane-decimating attack no celestial but many others have claimed to have perpetrated. </p>

<p>There is no Astral Plane,  and save for the claims of a few barmy natives, apparently there never was.</p>

<p>The Inner Planes are three in number. There is a Sea of Life and Death, where currents of Positive and Negative energy swirl together to produce shadow stuff.  There are the Cloud Lands, an oceanic nebulae of beautiful hues that produces this Multiverse's suns - all offering weak silvery light to the Primes they are sent into. And there is the Savannah of Dreams, a place of glowing azure and cerulean hues populated by shadow beings in shades of blue and indigo born from the dream soil continually rejuvenated with the dreams of this Multiverse. One can walk from the Savannah to the Outer Planes and its silver starred sky leads to the Cloud Lands, but be aware that Time passes differently in Dreaming. To traverse the Savannah is to be on a vision quest, by its very nature the plane offers wisdom and reconfiguration of the Self.</p>

<p>The Prime consists of Crystal Spheres separated by a featureless white void. The Prime Worlds are also made of shadow stuff, with advance civilizations (or their frothing ruins) utilizing the color of Chaos. Rennbuu, the Slaad Lord of Colors, is often worshiped across the worlds as the primordial force that gives existence some semblance of meaning. Harvesting this devotion, Rennbuu has become miserly with his gifting of hues and shifted his alignment to True Neutral.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Parallel XXVIII: The Alchemy of Virtue and Vice</p>

<p>The Spire, a swirling configuration of prismatic magical force, stands over a battlefield of elemental exemplars fighting what seems to be an unending Armageddon. High above this corpse laden madness - thankfully infinitely higher than the aerial war zones - Sigil sits as a coin with a central hole, rotating above the tip of the Spire. The hole, guarded by dabus, allows one to cross between the two sides when the Lady wishes it to be so.</p>

<p>On one side of the coin is Sigil as Canvas. This Sigil is rife with artists of all sorts and the ground underfoot glows with soft sunlight to illuminate their works and their forms. Public pavilions, arenas, and auditoriums play host to all manner of perversions and performances, and the Sensates, Ciphers, and Bleakers host all manner of operas, plays, and athletic competitions. </p>

<p>The other side of the coin is Sigil as Orchard. This Sigil is an overgrown jungle, its soil going far deeper than possible as it almost never breaks into the other side. The plants here have all sorts of magical properties and the alchemist guilds here use them for many different kinds of potions and salves. This side of Sigil is dominated by the khaasta, though the lack of dabus is largely due to the lack of work that needs to be done here to maintain a sprawling wild land.</p>

<p>There are four elemental planes, each bleeding into the plane of Concordant Opposition, itself a neutrally aligned mixture of the different elements and the results of their conjoining. It is in the Concordant Opposition that one finds liquid gold and star fire crystals, to name but two of its wonders.</p>

<p>Each elemental plane contains its own variations of fiends and celestials, who take on traits like those of the genasi but far more pronounced - crystalline horns, obsidian teeth, bat wings of living silver or feathers of fleshly gold, merfolk gills, salamander scales, lightning or fire running across flesh, eyes made of ball lightning, lower torsos cyclones or pillars of flame, flesh made from stone or radiant cold, hair of smoke or mist or rainfall, and so on. The Prime consists of Crystal Shells hanging stationary in a Cosmic Ocean of Ether. The Ethereal Ocean, in several Alternate Primes of this Multiverse, has been overrun by the hordes of the Nathi, the Devourer Plagues, or the Empire of Neth. The last is perhaps the most pervasive and dangerous, for the eyes and ears of Neth are that of its shape shifting Nethlings.</p>

<p>The Plane of Fire is a place of burning illumination ranging in tone from orange to blue to white, with the fiery inhabitants constantly contesting with hurricanes of ash. Here the celestials are courageous and proud, virtues they encourage in others. The fiends are gluttonous and wrathful, sins that visit upon others in their homes while tempting Primes to those same vices in the mortal spheres. Rivers of liquid flame connect various major sites here such as the Black Diamond Parliament of the Red Dragons and the Solar Orchard whose trees bear suns as fruit. The exemplars here are obsessed with exploration and fascinated by wheelwalkers, for they seek to illuminate all ignorance.</p>

<p>The Plane of Earth is a place of stone and soil where the Battle of Good and Evil is long eons of diplomacy leading into punctuated violence that often drags on into grinding wars of attrition. Here the celestials are loyal and steadfast as the firm mountains and bountiful soil. The fiends preach callousness and casual cruelty, dismissing those who cannot survive without charity as undeserving of their lives or even their souls. Many tunnels are filled with crystals containing the trapped souls of those a fiend lord has tricked into becoming a part of his or her collection. Tunnels bright with veins of precious metals lead to wonders such as the Seven Formian Kingdoms of Mercy and the cavern spanning Warforge Theocracies.</p>

<p>The Plane of Water is an ocean bursting with life. The water itself glows blue, and is filled with kelp and clouds of algae and plankton. The celestials here are compassionate and nurturing, entering into your emptiness the way the water spreads itself to fill its container. Inversely but similar, the fiends are obsessively suffocating and lustful. Water gardens are common here - when amongst the celestials one hears the laughter of orphans and when amongst the fiends one sees the overuse of body slaves. Currents ridden by turtles and cetaceans flow between what the residents believe to be holy places for the plane entire, places such as the relics of the Jade Whale Ossuary and the Great Coral Mosaic which depicts the face of a woman with blades for hair, a face larger than continents...</p>

<p>The Plane of Air is a frigid blue emptiness through which thunderheads and snow storms wander. The celestials here are joyous and also calming, seeking to reinvigorate those who have exhausted themselves in the battle against Evil. There are many way stations and floating oases the champions of Good can use to recuperate their bodies and spirits. The fiends here delight in whatever cruelties take their fancy and exact harsh retribution against those who cross them. They are much like the tanar'ri of Multiverse Prime - they believe all creation should be both larder and harem, existing only to fulfill their nightmarish whims. Great bridges of cloud lead one to the myriad market cities of the plane, where the residents trade in songs and scents as well as bottled rainbows, tempests bound into kettles, and cyclopean masterworks hammered out of lightning.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Item: Aligned Elements</p>

<p>Wheelwalkers can make a nice bit of jink by crossing over to Parallel XXVII and retrieving some of the elemental substances that have been melded with varied blends of Good, Balance, Order, Chaos, or Evil.</p>

<p>Aligned Elements have enabled the great artificers and alchemists to create the following items:</p>

<p>Arrows of Laughter: The heads of these arrows are carved from great meteors of hail whirling through the Plane of Air, the feathers of their shafts are from birds that made their homes upon that plane. Just as the celestials of the plane seek to spread joy, those hit by these arrows will be touched by a sense of happiness, specifically that of amor fati. These arrows are used to reinvigorate tribal cultures that are centered around competitive wars between tribes. Also used in training by martial cultures that wish to condition their youth to equating war with joy.</p>

<p>The Insatiable Hammer: Forged from fiendish ore by flames of gluttony, the Insatiable Hammer corrupts the Fire and Earth around it and thus spreading Evil's taint. Upon the great head of the war hammer the smith has traced the jaws of a wolf as filigree. Those who wield the hammer come to believe that all who fall before them deserve to be consumed, with the hammer smashing through the ribcage to drink of heart's blood. Once the wielder is defeated in battle, the hammer compels its owner to grasp its handle - it is at that point that the hammer bursts into white hot flames and consumes the one who failed it.</p>

<p>The Helm of Gentle Lightning: This helm, crafted by cyclopes from sheets of faint lightning, can only be utilized by shockers, storm giants, lightning mephits or other creatures connected to the essence of the storm. All those without such a connection face the danger of electrocution from even touching it, and even then its aura of idyllic peace will not work - The bearer of the helm, if touched by the storms, radiates a calmness and sense of peace often absent from those connected to the lightning.</p>

<p>Heart Waters: Those who bathe in these waters will come to feel a sense of compassion as well as jealous desire for those, and only those, other bathers they felt a sense of attraction to before the waters touched their skin. Note that a latent attraction is acceptable, but the magic of these waters will not engender affection.</p>

<p>Hate Crystal: Those in the vicinity of such a crystal who do not possess any fiend's blood in their veins will feel extreme antipathy for those around them. The longer one remains in the presence of such a crystal the stronger the feeling rises to overwhelm their natural thoughts and submerge them in loathing.</p>

<p>Angel Fire: Flames made golden and white by the purity and power of the celestials, angel fire must be carried via torches and braziers across the wheels. Supporters of Good in the Gilded Darkness risk much to transport to that Wheel, as the flames can be used to ward off the fiends and evil angels of that place. Those who find themselves suddenly without its protection, however, are likely to be tortured for eternity.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Parallel XXIX: Prime Time</p>

<p>On most parallels, the elemental and energy planes are the fount of all the substance of the multiverse, certainly no small feat. But on the prime of this reality, they are the source of more. Some peculiar cosmic alchemy blends these six essences into a potent seventh <cite>something</cite>; few mortals have even begun to breach the arcana with which it is harnessed, but its mere existence in the nooks and crannies of the prime has birthed strange, powerful creatures that have had dramatic impact on this multiverse.</p>

<p>The seemingly omnipotent beings that wander the prime of this parallel are frequently described as “gods”, though this is only in deference to their power. Though they sometimes take similar interest in mortal affairs, they are mysterious and deeply alien in their ambitions and motivations and, above all, possess no connection with or dependence upon belief; that their awesome abilities are innate and not subject to mortal fickleness is a profoundly unsettling truth for this parallel's planar powers.</p>

<p>Foremost among these mighty immortals are the Illuminators. Dwarfing the tallest mountains, these ten mute, armored giants travel the crystal spheres in a vessel the size of a world, nurturing life towards intelligence and civilization wherever they find it. As such, the known spheres of the multiverse prime are but a corner of civilized space in this reality. Dozens of intelligent races have crafted sophisticated empires spanning multiple spheres; hundreds more are not far behind. Advanced magic has as many forms as it has practitioners, from the sand runes of the umber hulks to the inscrutable topological arcana of the puddings. Artificer magic is widespread, with constructs and magical infrastructure commonplace on countless worlds (to say nothing of other curious intersections of magic and technology).</p>

<p>While the densest portions of the known spheres may feature hundreds of races peacefully coexisting in sprawling cities and on great magical space structures, the prime here is not all cosmopolitan tolerance. On the frontier there are still wars of enmity and conquest, though most learned long ago that the Illuminators do not abide genocide; even massive state-sponsored bloodshed is slightly more civilized than one might expect.</p>

<p>Contemporaries of the Illuminators number between a dozen and a hundred, depending on the source (the longer lists typically include legends of questionable authenticity as well as incarnations of what are most likely planar powers). </p>

<p>In light of the immense variety of races represented, the planes here are absolutely thick with lesser and intermediate powers. With so many realms based on alternative visions of aesthetic perfection, neighborly squabbles have found more and more powers retreating to demiplanes in the ethereal.</p>

<p>Arcadia, for instance, has been all but yielded to the gods of the thri-kreen, the xixchil, and other insect races, who have reshaped it into an endless hive of stadium-scale cells. Light pleasantly diffuses through each cell's golden walls during the daytime hours, as petitioners tend to a variety of exotic (and carefully arranged, naturally) flora and fauna. Misbehaving intruders are quickly dealt with by buzzing, insectile archons and their fractal honeycomb golems.</p>

<p>Alternately, in some cases the powers have proactively made homes for their new peers. A collective of good-aligned fire powers have fused all of the sand on Pelion, the desert layer of Arborea, into glass. A variety of energy, light, and color beings now reside here.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, the astral here is one of the largest graveyards of powers that a wheelwalker is likely to encounter. Many are the simply forgotten, though it's rumored that others were sent here purposefully, by malevolent prime immortals without the Illuminators' distaste for genocide.</p>

         <p>Parallel XXIX: Other Known Prime Immortals:</p>

<p>Indrell the Unfolder possesses the upper body of a tiefling mounted on the legs of a prismatic crystal spider. She spies on mortal dreams and when a particular instant catches her fancy, she will expand it to fill an entire world. Spelljammers in remote spheres report encounters that can only be Indrell's abandoned playthings, such as fully populated planets bearing remarkable resemblances to places in known space. One reputable space captain tells of receiving a personal tour of a surreal nightmare world from Indrell herself.</p>

<p>It is not clear whether Kubak the Watcher <cite>is</cite> an enormous white cube or simply dwells within one; whatever the case, this impenetrable and unresponsive structure migrates from one populated world to another, brazenly orbiting for years at a time (it is unclear if the 'watching' portion of Kubak's title is based on any evidence or simple presumption).</p>

<p>Those who have encountered Galek the Changer often mistake him for some manner of shadow creature, a two-dimensional humanoid of total blackness, fluttering in three-dimensional space like an optical illusion. He appears seemingly for no other reason than  murder, swiftly cutting his prey to pieces with his impossibly thin extremities. His victims are typically random individuals of little obvious importance; sometimes they are children. Many speculate that Galek is from the future, or exists entirely outside of time as it's understood.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Parallel XXIX: Further Prime Immortals:</p>

<p>Divoro the Spellcrafter often travels in the wake of the Illuminators, bringing the gift of magic to races newly prepared to practice it. A gargantuan, diaphanous phoenix, Divoro devises a unique and idiosyncratic expression of the magical arts for each new race that she encounters and frequently will first observe a world for years or decades towards this end. She shares new arcane knowledge primarily through dreams and bursts of insight, though occasionally she will fabricate the odd ancient text or archeological relic. The latter are typically not without a sense of humor.</p>

<p>What the great ship Spelljammer is to vessels, Duncan the Gracious is to cities, many times over. A sentient lunar ecumenopolis, the city-world Duncan is home to millions of beings from across the prime as well as some of the finest scholarship, art, and artifice magic available. While Duncan itself only communicates with its residents through the seamless automation that pervades so much of their lives, the constructs that perform various municipal functions can be remarkably chatty and forthcoming, explaining that their lord desires nothing more than to enable and observe the diversity and ingenuity of mortal life.</p>

<p>Little is know about Andar the Repeater, a cyclopian dandy who always appears in flickering black &amp; white. He is primarily (in)famous for consistently arriving at Galek the Changer's murder scenes moments too late.</p>

<p>While many of the immortals do take benevolent interest in the residents of the prime, others appear to feel quite differently. Millennia ago, the entity now known as the Sleeping Justifier trailed behind the Illuminators for decades, a sky-blackening tangle of tentacles reigning destruction down on newly enlightened worlds. The Illuminators could only subdue, not destroy, and now it slumbers at the center of a small, lonely star. When the star goes out, it will awaken.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Parallel XXX: The Mysterious Stranger</p>

<p>Wheelwalkers visiting this parallel generally find an empty void in which floats a naked, humanoid male of reasonably pleasant appearance.  You must bring your own air and light, though fortunately it is impossible to get lost; the only space here exists within a few arm's lengths of the Thinker.  He is normally lost in thought, but can be broken from his reverie with sufficient stimulus.</p>

<p>When asked, he explains that he normally spends his time imagining the reality he pleases, forgetting briefly that he is alone in existence.  No power seems able to harm or control him, and no persuasion seems to be able to convince him that wheelwalkers are not themselves figments of his imagination.</p>

<p>It is, however, possible to enter the Multiverse he imagines, with any sort of immersive telepathic bond -- which he can cast himself, if he likes.  This can be useful if he can be persuaded to focus his attention on any particular part of the Wheel, since he can, if convinced that it would be at all entertaining to do so, edit the Multiverse as he pleases.  Normally he abides broadly by his own rules, simply to make the madness-game somewhat interesting.</p>

<p>Upon exit when the bond is terminated, materials -- and people -- collected within this imaginary Multiverse seem to be as real and solid as material from any other Multiverse, even when taken to other Wheels.  The economic possibilities are intriguing, and really daring wheelwalkers have tried suggesting unusual physics to him, in order to harvest items they might be able to obtain nowhere else.  The philosophical consequences are also obvious, and have driven more than one wheelwalker to make an attempt on the Thinker's life.  Obviously, to date none have succeeded.  It's presumed that particularly annoying wheelwalkers are simply edited out of his game.</p>

<p>People escaping from the Thinker's reality often suffer from the fear that he can still stop imagining them if he chooses; it's a worrisome thing to think that one began existence merely as a figment for the entertainment of some casually mad god in a universe where the Sign of One was apparently right.  Otherwise, the structure of that world is a fairly straightforward one, with a Wheel of the most usual type, although the Thinker appears fond of crossover synergies and hidden puzzles, so his various worlds tend to be more littered with artifacts of lost realities or contradictory histories.</p>

         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>sciborg2</em> wrote:</div>Cool. I like the idea of these powerful forces on the Prime. I like how that shapes the Outer Planes as a result as well.</div></p>

<p>I actually didn't get into that as deeply as I'd originally planned. One thought I had, related to the whole primes vs. planars business - would it stand to reason that there might be some inverse relationship between prime diversity and planar grandiosity? </p>

<p>That is, in a prime where all the worlds are relatively similar you're probably going to have many powers that are worshiped on many different worlds. Those powers are going to be very powerful and likely have huge realms that define the character of huge sections of the outer planes.</p>

<p>On the other extreme, a different culture on each world means many not-so-powerful gods and presumably less coherent character to the planes (to say nothing of squabbling, etc).</p>

<p>In short, planars seems to disdain the prime for being an interchangeable bunch of cookie-cutter worlds (well, among other reasons) - but could prime monotony be an integral factor in the magnificence of the planes?</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Parallel XXXI: The Circle</p>

<p><em>"This idea that we travel through our lives as a group with several people that we have this core connection to, led by perhaps one bodhisattva, working on issues within our core character through the different lifespans, returning to the bardo, and then spinning out again. Beautiful."</p>

<p> -Summary of the Years of Rice and Salt</em></p>

<p>I draw my sword, studying the reflection of the dawn on its surface. My steel tints the sky, for I have never been able to wash it as clean as it was on its forge day.</p>

<p>"There must be something thicker than blood, a music, and with the Cadence of our beating hearts it flows from your veins into mine. These bodies are but vessels for our symphony."</p>

<p>And with those words echoing behind my every sword stroke I fall into the steady march of my column, wondering how my love and I will know each other in the next life.</p>

<p>=-=-=</p>

<p>"You lead this family to death!"</p>

<p>"Death, my son - what is death before dishonor? Only the latter is carried across Hel's every Harvest. Look to you who were before this life and take courage. </p>

<p>We are, in truth, Memories moving through corpses."</p>

<p>Instead of my supposed past lives I looked at my mother, tried to drink of her courage until I gagged but only fear gave strength to my roiling stomach's sickness.</p>

<p>I glanced out the window, and saw the armies like tides rising to crest over the walls of our city.</p>

<p>=-=-=</p>

<p>There are no dead lands in Parallel XXXI. There is no afterlife, or at least no permanent one. Instead it seems that souls reincarnate across this parallel, and though no one is sure why this is or if every soul is reborn it is clear that at least some souls are engaged in the cycle of birth and death.</p>

<p>The Outer Planes are partially a place, and partially an event. Actions leaning heavily toward an alignment will cause areas of their occurrence to take on aspects of the plane relating to that alignment or the virtue or vice being exalted. This doesn't always happen, and oftentimes it takes either years for reality to slowly be rewoven or a great event (such as an incredible betrayal that costs the lives of thousands) for an instantaneous shift. </p>

<p>Sigil, floating above Mount Meru which rises from the Primordial Ocean, takes on the architecture of the Land of Ind, Tir Na Nog, and the Shinto civilziations. The Vedic, Celtic, and Shinto pantheons hold an incredible amount of power on this Wheel as do the Dustmen and Believers of the Source. There is no Outer Wheel, the gods all reside on the Inner Planes, the Etheral, the Spirit Worlds, or the Astral-silver skied Primordial Ocean of Milk and Honey.</p>

<p>There are Spirit Worlds that border the planets of the Prime, and souls are often cycled between these border worlds and their mortal world. Other souls seem to have a need to find each other across reality, either being born into the same family or finding each other over time. Sometimes they meet as lovers or friends, sometimes as sworn enemies.</p>

<p>What is being sought by each Circle of Souls? Are the Godsmen and Dustmen right, in that some higher state of being can be sought? And what if this is the *only* Multiverse where the philosophies of either faction can lead to that place in (or beyond?) the Metaverse?</p>

<p>=-=-=</p>

<p>I scream out my mothers name as I cut down the invaders running through our household. Who is this Valkyrie inside me, when I am a small man with only a head for numbers not bloodshed? My training with a blade was but a formality, and yet here I find all my lessons paying my sword arm back tenfold.</p>

<p>=-=-=</p>

<p>I run him through, this son of a noble house that stands in the way of revolution. The name of my slaughtered slave girl, my beautiful flower, I spit it into his face...and for a moment my entire lifetime reels, and I think I have impaled a wife I never had...</p>

<p>And then all is vengeance and a search for a good death, one whose echoing tide will deliver me to a new shore my lost love has already been born into...waiting for me...</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Digressions on Parallel Walking</p>

<p>"I am a tiefling, birthed onto the hot stone of Avernus, shuffled off to the blood bright sands of Carceri. I was a scout in the Blood War."</p>

<p>He stops and spits.</p>

<p>"Guardinals rescued me. Thought they were going to kill me, but instead they tried to heal me. Tried to...correct me. Eventually I left their care, realizing the darkness in me was too deep for them to heal.</p>

<p>Started walking, and without doing anyone a good turn I ended up in an Elysium filled with the chatter of bats. Then the next one was an endless arctic realm with the darkest forces of the Primordial Age frozen in the ice floes.</p>

<p>Realized I could walk the Wheels, thanks to the help of the Silverback Shadows. For awhile I help them, hunted the ones who went against the gift of the Seven's teachings. Made corrections, but after awhile even though I knew I was saving lives the blood on my hands just seemed like blood, soaking my palms and fingers down to the bone no matter what the cause.</p>

<p>Figured I'd see what it all comes to - the work of the angels. That's why I joined up with the Hunters of the Golden Wheel. To collect what I'm owed from the Metaverse."<br />
  - Ilgiad Dalad, Former Metaversal Tracker for the Seven Silverback Shadows </p>

<p>=-=-=</p>

<p>"In this place, the Blue Age never fell to the Green." The proof of his words is held by the sky whose brightness stings my eyes with cerulean daylight. </p>

<p>All around us the trees weave themselves into tabernacles, with blossoms that collect the sunlight and glow at the haflings' command in the dark of the night. Great manta rays, part flesh and part fungal, soar through the skies as transport with the arboreal cities and the ones of sea coral and underground mushrooms.</p>

<p>Spider steeds move around the twisting branches, their abdomens hollowed out, organs flattened to the sides,  to hold passengers making their way inside the arboreapolis. </p>

<p>"Why are we here?" I ask the Retkonur. The Elan turns to me and smiles, a courting tudor presenting the subject of his wooing with an overly generous gift. He has a pretty smile but I am wary of loving someone who doesn't age. Won't he grow tired of me as the years pass on?</p>

<p>"They defeated the tidal plagues that destroyed almost every other Athas. They did it without cataclysm. They are the true masters of Life. </p>

<p>With their help, you can reinvigorate the The Room of the Rancid and Rotting in the Crossroads House. Perhaps then you won't have to rely so much on the Prisoner."</p>

<p>I almost kiss him full on the mouth.<br />

         <p>I'm sorry I can't keep up with numerals <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/tongue.png" title="Sticking out tongue" alt="Sticking out tongue" class="smiley-content"/> here is a loose idea...<br />
(not many details, as I'm a total noob with the multiverse)</p>

<p>Entropic Thunder</p>

<p>The debate of how, why, when, who has died out, nobody no longer cares. The energies of entropy gained strength throughout the multiverse, so much that even powers began suffering from it. Some powers have decayed so much only a fragment of their power and sanity is left.</p>

<p>The Queen of blades, has earned a new nick name... Queen of Rust as her blades and once pearl of a city is now rusted, decayed and on the brink of utter destruction. The queen herself no longer hides or wanders, she sits on a huge throne in the middle of a huge market place, there are no stalls or people in the square, nobody dares to be near the Queen. She sits here, sighing, drumming her fingers idly on the armrest of her huge throne, while flakes of rust slowly but surely falls from her body and Sigil slowly decaying her and the city.</p>

<p>The multiverse has been swept in a tidalwave of entropy and despair, the general feel of any plane or person is... "who cares anymore, it's just a matter of hours or days before we are gone"... it's a dismal grey corrupted decaying multiverse... </p>

<p>But nothing ever happens without anyone benefitting from it, does it?<br />
so who is responsible, how and what can be done?</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Planar Refugee</p>

<p>In this parallel all powers/entities have been banished from all planes to the prime, although powers have been retained, they are still diminished as the powers have been forced to manifest on each prime world they in some form were worshipped splitting their powers in equal parts. </p>

<p>It all happened very sudden and without warning, none of the powers knows what happened, they know they are on the prime and cannot travel into the multiverse on their own. They have no connection with the other manifastations of their previous entity.</p>

<p>This has severe implications on the worlds they now inhabit, they are no longer immortals but are beings of great power. The irony is that, their power is diminished equal to how many worlds they were worshipped on and as such their former glory is now their biggest weakness. Mortal worshippers can now kill (if lucky or well equipped etc) their god's rival god. </p>

<p>Who or what is now in control of the planes? and how does it affect the primes?<br />
I imagine players could be playing the banished powers or they could help them restore the multiverse if they are metaverse walkers.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><strong>Parallel XXVI</strong></p>

<p><cite>Let's just say that everything went according to plan. That is, let's say that there was a plan.</cite></p>

<p><cite>My trial in Regulus went something like this: “bleep bloop blork. grind her to bits.”</cite></p>

<p><cite>With this in mind and no routes of escape presenting themselves, sneakily hitting my paperwork with some confusion magic seemed like a decent idea. And did it ever work. To anyone who doubts the procedural devotion of the modrons: I will fight you. They left me be, waiting for sentencing orders that might as well have been fluttering in the Abyss somewhere, through nothing less than the complete upheaval of the multiverse. If the tanar'ri hadn't shown up looking for one of their own I suppose I'd have sat there in my timeless narcotic haze for another thirty centuries.</cite></p>

<p><cite>The conspirators were basically right, though the plan didn't go off quite as smoothly as they'd feared. While Primus claimed the planes of law fairly quickly, the rest of the great wheel did not go so quietly. The planes of chaos hardly budged (though to claim they're "intact" might be a step too far) and the planes of conflict have become the ruined battleground in the middle.</cite></p>

<p><cite>Mechanus looks like it's been redecorated by the Lords of the Nine. I'd never have guessed that Mount Celestia and Arcadia were in there somewhere, though I didn't exactly take the grand tour, getting out of there as quickly as I could and all. Word is that Martinet has the ear of Primus and has been lawyering the way towards totalitarianism for many centuries now. The petitioners are faceless cast-iron humanoids integrated into the infrastructure of Mechanus, pushing gears and holding up structures; the perfect combination of conformity and torment.</cite></p>

<p>"When Mechanus swallowed the planes of law, we took action. Those of us who fought the maruts were the lucky ones. The ursinals and mustevals will be remembered for bearing as grim a duty as has fallen to any guardinal. They took to Elysium with fire and burned the unknowing confederates that had once been our wards wherever they found them. You see why it is called the Weeping Inferno."</p>

<p>- Duke Fullgrim, Leonal Outcast</p>

<p><cite>Many I spoke with shared the opinion that Primus played his hand earlier than planned, in light of the sheer madness that the planes of chaos had become. When I first arrived here, the lesser tanar'ri constructs were pathetic and wretched; they might as well have been bags of water for all their ability to maintain a coherent form for any period of time. But the rare few that graduated into something more not only became truly terrible monsters - they discovered that they could transform other living beings into creatures like themselves with nothing but a touch. Typically this was simply the prelude to draining the life force of the recipient creature, and the tanar'ri left legions of burned-out black statues in their wake as they fed across the planes. Along the way, some creatures were transformed but escaped death and others were transformed for other reasons entirely. This radically reformed their bodies but not their minds; once Mechanus annexed its neighbors even the good denizens of chaos could not ignore the utility of this new flesh, as fluid as the wind one moment and as hard as diamond the next. It was the ideal armor in the rapidly unfolding second war of Law &amp; Chaos.</cite></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Parallel XXXIV: The Grudging Truce</p>

<p>From beyond the rim of this Great Wheel, the <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/additionalMonsters/aeon.html">Aeons</a> came, somehow stepping through the Spire onto the lands of the Rilmani. Together, they found a means of offering the Second Death to all that would oppose them.</p>

<p>The Aeons and Rilmani rode forth on the concordant dragons they'd recast in the Spire's heart, and these massive leviathans now breathed out lances of light with every exhale, and those outsiders run through by their exhalation did not rise upon their planes - instead they were lost to this Wheel and perhaps to the Metaverse.</p>

<p>Grazz't was the first to propose an alliance with the surrounding planes: <em>Charge the Outlands or watch the Rilmani rise to tyranny with the aid of their Aeon advisers.</em> At first many did not heed him, even as the Blood War lost more to the Breath of Light than had been killed in ages.</p>

<p>Then Khin-Oin fell from within, as apparently in this world the Oinoloth had been Center-of-All, the rilmani trickster, since before the obyrith created the tanar'ri. All this time, the aurumach had been patiently waiting for the right opportunity to topple the power structure of the yugoloths.</p>

<p>On the outer walls of the tower's ruins all the known baern are now crucified. <em>This</em> led the Multiverse into alliance against the neutral exemplars, though it was not soon enough to keep the Spawning Stone intact. This was actually a miscalculation on the part of Neutrality, for what the slaad have become now that they are Unbound are creatures vast and amphibious and amorphous...they will need to be dealt with once the Rilmani and Aeons are cast down.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, with the Outlands besieged and celestials forced to make common cause with fiends, Sigil is a city prone to violent outbursts and bar room brawls. After all, it is only here that the Rilmani and their Aeon friends are barred, only here that one can relax enough to let old familiar hatreds breathe. Across the planes the portals incoming from the Outlands have been torn down or at least locked but Neutrality gets around this by bringing the dragons into towns which are then encouraged to slide to whatever plane the self titled Lords of Balance wish to strike.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Parallel XXXV: The Wind Swept Lands</p>

<p>Sigil has become the focal point of a planes wide disaster. An artifact built to draw power from the Elemental Plane of Air was used to keep Duke Rowan Darkwood from completing the speaking of the Sigil Spell while outside of Sigil through the clever use chronomancy and the message sending properties of the Harmonica. It is also important to note that the Evil Elemental Princes were on the verge of releasing their dark master who few suspected was Tharizdun.</p>

<p>The artifact was an ancient fail-safe prepared by the Wind Dukes and, surprisingly, Dagon. It was used in Sigil with the Lady's blessing apparently, preempting the Duke's use of the Sigil Spell. This action likely saved this Wheel because it ushered a powerful dimensional glyph made of winds from around the Multiverse that kept Tharizdun from reconstituting itself, scattering his essence into 333 artifact level magical gems.</p>

<p>However, the price of keeping the monstrous Entropy Lord from arising with more power than ever before was higher than perhaps even the Wind Dukes worst case estimates. Most of the edifices on the Outer Planes have been torn apart by the unrelenting hurricanes that ravage the planes of Good, Evil, and Neutrality. Even Limbo has been affected, as winds carrying the Cold of Ice have frozen large swaths of chaos matter. These nightmarish storms have rent apart the mortai, who are now weeping voices strewn across the Beastlands. The three towers of the yugoloths are shattered fragments strewn across the Lower Planes of Conflict. The Pillar of Skulls has been toppled on Baator, and the winds have torn Jangling Hiter from its supporting chains - the city is now half sunken and all shattered within the swamps of Minauros. The citadels on the Plain of Infinite Portals are naught but flotsam whirling inside the titanic tornadoes that congest the first layer of the Abyss. </p>

<p>Sigil's surface is empty save for air elementals and those few with the power to withstand the barrage of of the winds spilling out of the white-iron mace - the artifact the Dukes created to serve as a planes wide ward. Undersigil, however, has never been more congested and crowded.</p>

<p>The Prime worlds have seen stormier weather as a result, a great number of hurricanes and tornadoes, and the gods have answered less and less prayers and granted less spells to their clerics as the deities must devote a great deal of power to simply keep their realms intact. Powers who possess domains relating to storms or the wind are likely to rise to the heads of pantheons and their priests in turn are already setting up theocratic empires on the Prime. However, forces from the Quasi-Elemental Plane of Lightning have begun make excursions into the storm wracked mortal worlds, though they have yet to commit to any definitive plan of conquest.</p>

<p>The Inner Planes feel the winds as well, and are currently dealing with the mass invasion of the djinn and invisible stalkers who seek to bring Air to dominance. Cryonax has lent them considerable aid, perhaps realizing that in this Multiverse joining the winning side is the best he can hope for. The forces of Smoke have been less willing to ally with the forces of Air, largely due to the general annexing of the plane by the Efreeti seeking to safeguard the paraelemental border.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Parallel XXXVI: The Center Cannot Hold</p>

<p>Ygorl has crashed the Spawning Stone into the base of the Spire. Riddled with cracks, the infinitely tall pillar seems destined to topple. The Slaad as a people spin off into creatures encompassing simultaneous forms vastly different from their once definitive amphibian shape.</p>

<p>Most of these beings, now Moorcockian Dancers at the End of Time have little interest in fighting the myriad races and peoples now arrayed against them in vengeance or hope of preventing the coming calamity. They instead travel across the planes, spreading the insanity of an incoherent space-time. However, there are those loyal to the other Slaad Lords who feel that Ygorl has cheated them by placing Entropy above all other aspects of Chaos - in fact they realize that Entropy will ultimately swallow their own Concepts as much as it will break down the Law. Of all the beings in the Multiverse that might reverse this disaster, perhaps only babbling Ssendam has the key....</p>

<p>The concept of locality seems to be breaking, so all the Inner and Outer Planes are experiencing the ever increasing degradation of reality. Mountains crumble, dragons age without warning, seas boil, Time writhes like a serpent on hallucinogenics, Malsheem rusts, the gears of Mechanus don't seem to fit as well, the Gray Waste orgasms out its hoard of emotions and colors, Yggdrasil rots and Mount Olympus slides into the Plane of Elemental Earth...</p>

<p>Primus and other forces of Law warn that this act is treason against creation itself, and if the Rilmani weren't busy sickening and dying in their diaspora they'd likely jump on this band wagon. Instead they serve as Exhibit 1.0 for the doom crying Guvners going into public hysterics on the streets of Sigil.</p>

<p>Sigil itself seems to be largely immune from the decoherence, save for the randomness afflicting the efficacy of portals. The keys are definitely shifting, but thankfully for now the destinations of the portals seems to remain the same even if they randomly fail to work every now and then. The Doomguard have also declared victory for their side, celebrating with drunken revelry or attempting to convert everyone to the worship of Ygorl.</p>

<p>Factol Skall has taken all the Dustmen into the Negative Material Plane, to meditate the onset of what he believes is True Death.</p>

<p>The lower level Sensates desperately attempt to experience everything they can, while the high ups of the factions prepare some mysterious ritual connected to the symbol in the faction headquarters.</p>

<p>The Ciphers are broken, deaf to the Cadence. The Chaosmen seem more erratic than ever, and the Anarchists are split as always as to the virtue of Ygorl's actions.</p>

<p>The Harmonium and Mercykillers seem to have a plan, something to do with the now beleaguered Elementals of Law and the enactment of a punishment fit for The Crime...</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Parallel XXXVII: My Father's Mansion, the One of Many Rooms </p>

<p>(thanks to Colin McComb for the seed of this idea!)</p>

<p>Step through a door and walk onto the beaches of Oerth, take flight and soon enough, a mere matter of decades, you will find the frescoes being painting by aasimon seeking to record their interventions to save this place on its ceiling. Climb a stairwell and enter a tower overlooking a stone playroom whose detailed filigree regenerates against the assault of madness driven winds. Infantile monstrosities weep out of hunger in the darkness, overseen by nurses that seem to be hybrids of your ideal beauties and those giant spiders you feared as a child.</p>

<p>All the Multiverse is a single house, an infinite home of interconnecting stairwells and rooms. But the rooms can sometimes be large enough to swallow worlds, and the stairwells of prismatic force might twist and writhe through foyers until their spiraling lengths of subjective gravity touch the doors that rarely seem to lead to the same place twice. </p>

<p>There are god rooms and rooms awash with cosmic oceans, heavenly rooms that are studio apartments waiting for a mother and daughter to live there. </p>

<p>There are cells where the tortured are packed in, rooms where mass graves double as iceboxes for demonic butcher shops. </p>

<p>In some rooms the wall paper depicts reliefs of paradise shining out merciful sunlight but devils ply their trade within the living spaces, in others one hears titanic fauna scurrying or the World Serpent slithering or the whispering of pleading prayers to Paladine in the walls but rooms are in the midst of ice ages or golden ages or ages of illithid dominance where red lamps shine over the world spread across the floor.</p>

<p>There are rooms filled with forests, and others that no one has been able to open but the scent of cinnamon or the sound of lovers draws visitors hoping they might have the key.</p>

<p>Somewhere in all the halls and stairs and rooms is the mysterious Sigil Room, a fabled place where a Lady sits waiting for a visitor. Perhaps a rescuer, perhaps a rival. Who, the inhabitants of this House wonder, are the implacable dabus and their living rebus legions searching for?</p>

<p>And is this a true Multiverse at all, or another maneuver of the Crossroads House in its long game against (and somehow simultaneously on behalf of?) its makers, The Architects of Infinity?</p> <div class="dice_rolls">
