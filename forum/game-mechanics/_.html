</div> <p>We need to start working on how the game will actually play. Now I'm open to suggestion but I feel we should at least apply Lord British's Law.</p>

<p>"If you can't at least pick it up. Its useable." Or something along those lines.</p>

<p>We don't actually need D&amp;D mechanics and it would seem that a game on this level of MMO pen and paper rules aren't really going to work, unless we actually want to create less than what we want to achieve. However I could be wrong. My knowledge of D&amp;D mechanics is quite limited.</p>       </div>

         <p>I would agree, the mechanics for pen and paper are different from what is required of an MMO. That would also allow us to tinker a bit more to rebalance some stuff, such as making all of the races even as opposed to having almost all of the planer races at LA +1, and it keeps us from treading in places where the WotC lawyer's would feel compelled to come after us.</p>

<p>I guess the question then becomes where do we start? Should we go with four  or five options each for races and classes?</p>

<p>EX) Races: Human, Dwarf, Elf, Goblin and Tiefling</p>

<p>Classes: Warrior, Mage, Cleric, Thief and Barbarian</p>

<p>For the races in my example, the first three are all fantasy staples and can help ground people who have no PS experience. The goblin is known, but not often a PC race in MMOs, so that adds a bit strangeness to it, and the Tieflings are iconic to the setting. We can always add other races as more people join.</p>

<p>Classes are all fairly basic, Warrior as a tank/damage, Thief as a debuffer and pinpoint attacker, Barbarian as DPS, Cleric as buffer/light tank, and Mage as ranged magic.</p>

         <p>Hmm, I'm not sure I like the idea of making set classes. People should be allowed to create the character they want. While I know this gives rise to certain problems, thank you very much Bethesda Softworks!, I still think we could incorporate a system that would allow folks to do be what they wanna be. The question I'm asking is how do we do this in a way that won't have player abusing such a system. </p>

<p>I feel an XP system, while simple, would subject people to power leveling and thats just something want to avoid at all costs. Hoi people are idiots online!</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I just sort of assumed that you'll be using either the 2e or, more likely, 3.5e system. It would be difficult to use parts of them while changing other parts, especially if you lose the core idea of classes. You could, of course, come up with a ruleset all your own and only keep the fluff of Planescape. In fact, I've long desired to see something of the sort. Indeed, I'm slowly fleshing out an stat/skill based system for my own purposes, but its not easily convertable to Planescape, since I'm designing a campaign setting alongside.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Personally, I'm okay with doing away with classes, but I think that getting rid of experience completely would end up being an issue. One idea that I've thought of before would be to borrow from EVE and have an additional Real-Time requirement for each skill you wanted to increase. This way we can make ''modules'' that can be taken and applied to each character making them unique. It almost makes each skill like a cross between feats and skills in 3e. We could also divide experience into different categories (see Fable, which was my reference point for the idea) but that may just put it completely over the top.</p>

<p>Before I ramble, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EVE_Online" class="bb-url">this</a> is the wiki for EVE and its unique progression is explained on this page.</p>

<p>Okay, the basic idea would be that everything is divided up into skills and you need both experience and training time to increase the level of that skill. For example (yes, I like examples) say healing magic, fire magic, basic combat, axe training, arcane magic, divine magic, diplomacy, and sneaking . </p>

<p>The four most basic skills of this set would be:<br />
basic combat <br />
arcane magic <br />
divine magic <br />
sneaking<br />
diplomacy</p>

<p>Any of these can be can bought at first level and each race gets a certain number of skills as bonuses. All of the initial training in the skill would be easy, requiring little time to be completed, and a very low experience. Thus, everyone could pick up a bit of combat training to help them when things get messy. The catch is that every time you access a higher proficiency with that skill, the time and experience need to level it up again increases. Thus, if you decide that you want your fighter to become a swordsage, you'd just need to find an appropriate NPC tutor to teach you and you can easily get the most basic levels of arcane magic under your belt. Likewise, that allows anyone to be streetwise or a savvy talker, they just need to invest in diplomacy.</p>

<p>Higher level skills, such as fire magic, healing magic and axe training would have prerequisites before you can access them, and greater training values, but they would also grant more stackable bonuses or special attacks or spells to the list of things you could do. For example, Axe Training could require you to be proficient with axes and have Basic Combat 2, and it grants you bonuses when using axes, as well as special attacks like pinpoint strikes and overhead chops. What do you think?</p>

<p>On a completely random note, do we think it will be possible to use instances in the game? One of the things I remember being worried the most about LotRO was that people would camp bosses or that other people would be running around while I was on an epic story and it would be a complete mood kill and the instances gave me the feeling that it was me and only me (plus my party) that was on this quest. Plus it would cut down on the bandwidth.</p>

         <p>Random interjection, for what it's worth.  There's a sort of MUSH called Vaxia that has a similar system to what you're describing.  No classes, just skills (that act like a cross between skills and feats from 3e) and the progression of XP that allows you to augment stats and skills or learn new ones.</p>

<p>There's one thing that might help in keeping everyone on the same page:  it has a system called Banked XP.  The idea is that your XP from a given quest or instance caps out until you slowly unlock it overtime by putting in actual playtime.  </p>

<p>You wind up with two scales, the XP buffer, and the XP bank.  Playtime put in increases your XP buffer.  Any sudden burst XP (from quests or instances) becomes immediately usable only up to the XP buffer.  It also drains the buffer on a 1-to-1 basis, so you have to build it back up again to receive more.  Any overflow gets stored in the XP bank.  Afterwards, further playtime rebuilds the XP buffer and slowly unlocks the XP bank, so that the player temporarily gets double XP for playtime put in until the XP bank is emptied (something akin to the rest XP system that World of Warcraft uses).  </p>

<p>The idea is that those who sign on to run instances can't immediately dart ahead of those who prefer more casual play.  Vaxia also has the diminishing returns system, where stats and skills have specific thresholds, and after passing each threshold, the rate of XP-per-point increases, making it easier for new players to catch up to veterans (or at least not be totally left in the dust).</p>

<p>Not sure if it'll help, but, figured I'd toss it in there just in case.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>That could definitely work too. On other idea I've had is allowing a player to increase the amount of experience spent on a skill in order to decrease the amount of time it takes to learn it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.eve-online.com/itemdatabase/EN/skills/" class="bb-url">This</a> is the database for all of the EVE skills, just to illustrate what I'm referencing when I'm explaining ideas. Personally, I think adding special attacks in at different skill levels would work well in addition to simple statistical bonuses.</p>

         <p>I've plated around with the diea of using EVE online style skill system in a 'normal' MMO and bascially I came to the conclusion that is doesnt work well.</p>

<p>Why?.....well, basically, skills in EVE online gives you small percetnage bonus's to your abilites - specificially in EVE online, small bonus's to your SHIPS equipment ie small railguns gives you a 5% damage bonus to your SHIPS small railguns. Virtually all of the skills work like that - therefore, the skills in EVE online augment your SHIP. In a 'normal' MMO, a player character doesnt have a ship, they have 'normal' equipment - sword, axe, plate armour. So the translation would be that your axe skill would give you a 5% bonus to your axe damage for each level you have. Which is all well and fine, however, that then requires that you make the game very item heavy to distiginsh between different power levels of player characters - it would be even more itmem heavy that world of wearcraft (wow)...which some communities of MMO players feel it the wrong direction to go in (a common complaint is that with heavy itemization PVP cant have winners looting losers due to valuable equipment being sooo important.....)</p>

<p>As for dnd 2e/3(.5)e mechanics, those too I considered, but they wouldnt work well either. First of all, most MMO now expect 'leveled' MMOs to have a large range of levels to keep them busy which dnd mechanics do not support. Also, back to itemization, making a comparason to wow, dnd mechanics wouldnt offer enough variability to support a similiar level of itemization. Plus, the mechanics are quite stagnant, with attributes remaining largely unchanged during the 20 levels and the skills being very complicated and 'useless' to the average MMO player I would guess. </p>

<p>As to a skill based system, their is a large and still growing opinion with some MMO communities that is the way to go - it is just very difficult to create. It does avoid one of the major 'problem' areas of most MMOs - End Game - with no upper level limit, no player should be able to 'max' out the level and then get bored and look for more reandom things to do (ie raid or PVP). The problem with skill based systems is that most MMO players enjoy the predictibility of knowing if a enemy (mob) is within their 'level range' so they dont just die straight away when they start. Hard core players may not find such a loss so significant, as with more experience of the game, the player (not their character) would more than likely know how to jude a mobs capabilities from its lcoation, equipment, race etc. A solution to that problem would be to use levels (which unfortunately uncludes an end game), and with each level up, a character earns a set number of skill points to spend improving their skills......</p>

<p>One last thing on this rather long post - wow might have a lot of problems, but in the end, is it very successful. One reason, I beleive, as to why its so successful is that it has a very intrutive interface and the opening couple of hours of game play are very noob friendly, and help a new player to understand the game without the fear of dieing etc and move them along a series of quests and quick level up to make them feel they have achieved something (i didnt level Everquest 2 opener - it took a lot longer to a get a quick few levels and the interface was a lot more clunky)..</p>

<p>Anyways, I'll stop now</p>

<p>That was an example, I didn't want to have to think of and type out dozens of skills. I took the four iconinc classes (Warrior, Mage, Cleric and Thief) and picked an ability for example purposes, then added diplomacy so they weren't all combat based. I fully expect for there to be many many many more basic skills then that. Almost any 3.e skill could conceivably be used, any class feature and any feat could be used as inspiration for a skill in this system, combat or non -combat. </p>

<p>That is true, but I think we can end up getting around that simply by making skills that aren't item based. For example, the Dustmen could get access to the unique skill 'Dead Truce' which improves their relationship with the undead and prevents the lesser ones from attacking, and affects more and more undead as you increase it's level. Or you could take 'bluff' which gives you more potential dialogs with NPCs involving lying and cheating them, and those are more likely to be successful. Or could take 'Animal ally', which grants you said ally and makes it more powerful.</p>

<p>That is true, we would need some way of dealing with that. It would take a lot of effort to create a skill based system, and we would need a way of judging power levels, but think we can address these issues without going class based.</p>

<p>That is also true, being easy to pick up will be important, and I think that is one of the problems with EVE, the introduction is long and tedious for a new player. I will point out however, that most of that is because of the economic run through and teaching you how to fly your ships.</p>

         <p>Well, as I have been given the mantle to get the game mechanics on course, I want to get a few critical things clear in my own mind from the project so far.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Question 1</span><br />
<span style="font-style:italic">What is the main gameplay aspect of PSOnline?</span></p>

<p>Is it gonna be a traditional MMO where you hackl down mobs outside of town, then come in and train up, maybe have a crafting skill to make a few items? (wow/ eq like)</p>

<p>Or is it gonna be more free form with no need to go and kill monsters, instead a character can grow and advance in more civilised professions, devoting themselves to mansonry, artwork, resturant running etc etc? (EVE, 2nd life sort of)</p>

<p>this will influence whether character need to kill monsters/complete quests to advance tgheir characters.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Question 2</span><br />
<span style="font-style:italic">Do we want a class based system or a free form skill based system?</span></p>

<p>Having classes generally means a more combat orientated game, with each class filling a role in mass combat - which usually ends with 'raiding'. From a design point of view, having classes makes the game slightly easier to balance (but balance is never truely achieved in most MMOs), but limits what a character may do.</p>

<p>A free form skill system allows any single character to eventually master any profession / combat style they wish. roles in groups become more difficult to determine, but experienced players can still achieve 'raids'.</p>

<p>I feel that we are already leaning towards a skill system, but I just want to be sure here. I would also like to point out that from a business prespective, a class based system is more likely to be profitable, as a player that wishes to experience a different class role with most likely 'reroll' thereby increasing his playing time and therefore increases his likelyhood of further monthly subscriptions (I know that is most irrelevant to PSOnline, but I thought it should be mentioned).</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Question 3</span><br />
<span style="font-style:italic">To use a level based system experience system or an alternative?</span></p>

<p>though this question is linked to question 2, it is independent from it and therefore needs to be considered both independently and in combination with the overall game.</p>

<p>Using a level based experience system is a simple solution to the game mechanics, but involves the necessaity of character killing (or 'grinding') enemy mobs for the experience and also usually repetiative quests.</p>

<p>An alternative is much like EVE online's real time skill training system, whereby your character trains a skill passively, whether you are on or offline and any actions you take while online rarely effect the training od your skills. This allows more 'interesting' game play options for the player, but limits the potential for new players coming in late as they are several years worth of skill training time behind those that joined the game when it was first launched. EVE has tried to compensate for this with higher starting skill packages more recently, but that has not solved the problem, just lessened it slightly.</p>

<p>Other altneratives include just quest xp for a level system, whereby just completing the quest gives you an experience reward, killing monsters does not, which may fit better with planescape, but would require better quality quests than most current MMO (go get me 10 rat livers....i dont think so).  I believe Stormreach used this system, though I have never played it.</p>

<p>Another option is a task master system, whereby a character improves their skills only by performing them ie improving your cooking by cooking, improve your axe skill by using an axe in combat etc etc.</p>

<p>Well, thats my first post on this finished (sorry about its length).</p>

         <p>Though I'd like some feedback for my pervious post, i'd thought I'd update folks a little.</p>

<p>Having spent yesterday afternoon rattling my head about the net, doing some research into different approaches we cna take, i've start to work out a mechanic.</p>

<p>The basics</p>

<p>Open end skill based system with no levels.</p>

<p>Every character has 3 secondary attributes of Health, Mana, and Energy</p>

<p>Advancing skills adds a variable amount to each of these, dependant on the skill. Therefore, highly skilled character would have more Health, Mana and or energy than less skilled individuals. </p>

<p>With this, we can also include skills not directly realted to combat if we choose a less combat heavy game approach.</p>

<p>If folks are ok with this concept, I will start to work out how all the numbers will work...</p>

         <p>energy is merely a limited resource with which to fight using 'special' techniques which arent spells. i invision it very similiar to how rogues are handled in wow (sorry...). </p>

<p>for example, you want to knee cap someone or thing. You would need to trainthe Knee Cap skill. With rank 1, you can the ability Knee Cap, which you can then use to 'attack' someone with. When do you use your new Knee Cap ability, it will cost a certain amount of energy (very similair to mana based spell casting). And during the fight, your energy will regenerate (much like a rogue on wow - its restores itself completely in 10 seconds - makes it different from the slow restore of mana for magic heavy characters).</p>

<p>I do release that my intial examples are all combat based, but that is the industry standard atm. I not against trying to do something different with PSOnline, but I need input from more people if they want something more than merely combat, as most MMO and classic RPGs (computer wise) were and still are combat based (most single player RPG needs your character gain levels before they can go to the next area to continue the plot).</p>

<p>the question with factions and what not is - do we leave them in the hands of NPCs and merely allow characters to establish 'classic' guilds with which to organise themsevles (which can have reputations), or do we allow players to join Sigil's Factions (as in THE FACTIONS), progress in them, eventually taking control of the faction as a whole and influencing its direction/ingame actions directly?</p>

<p>EDIT: in the first case, players can still join THE FACTIONS but wont be able to become Factol..</p>

          Game Mechanics        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Ok folks, I wanna put up some initial ideas on the game mechanics of player characters.</p>

<p>A character has 3 sets of major defiing qualities. They are:-<br />
a) Attribtues<br />
b) Skills<br />
c) Bars</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Attribtues</span><br />
I think everyone is familiar with the conept of attrbiutes. The question is, how many, and how board the attributes are going to be. Two exmaples for MMO's I'm most famailiar are</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">WOW</span><br />
Strength<br />
Dexterity<br />
Stamina<br />
Intelligence<br />
Spirit</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">EVE</span><br />
Charisma<br />
Intelligence<br />
Memory<br />
Preception<br />
Willpower</p>

<p>Two very different examples, but a key point to both of them is that there is only 5. Keeping the number of attributes low I feel is important, keeps things simple and easier for players (especially new players) to understand their character's better.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Skills</span><br />
Again, most people should be famailar with the basic concept of what a skill is. Within this proposal, I envisage a skill system similiar to EVE online, where a character may (eventually) train almost any skill. An example from EVE would be Gunnery, a basic skill, which, opens up many more Gunnery type skills you can learn as you improve the basic Gunnery skill.</p>

<p>As to learning/training skills. Learning a skill is when a character has no current understanding of that skill. They would hav e to find a suitable trainer/teacher and pay (or maybe do a quest?) to earn the skill. Once 'bought' a character would just train it without the need for further payment. In regards to how to train a skill, I am still unsure, whether taskmaster system or real time (EVE) system or something else?</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Bars</span><br />
Bars are present in most MMOs and many RPGS. They are a character health bar/pool, a character mana bar/pool. Within a MMO environment, such Bars allow distinction between new characters and experienced, played characters very easily. Within PSO, I propose 3 such bars. Health, Mana and Energy. I have briefly outlined Energy in an earlier post in this thread, but the main point for the following discussion is that it would always remain at a constant amount aka 100. This is in contrast to Health and Mana, which would increase as the character progressed.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Together</span><br />
So, how do these 3 major parts fit together? I propose a system I originally became aware of from Elder Scrolls Oblivion Mod community and the KCAS leveling MOD. Bascially, each skill has 3 governing attributes. Whenever a skil is increased, those 3 attrbitues recieve an increase based on how they contribute to the skill (with a total increase of 1 overall). </p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Example: Axe skill has strength 50%, dexterity 15% and stamina 35%. When the character increases their Axe skill, their Strength Attribute increases by 0.5 (50% of 1), their dextiery increases by 0.15 (15% of 1) and their stamina increases by 0.35 (35% of 1).</span></p>

<p>In turn, Atrtbitues determine the Bars (only health and mana, as energy stays constant). Health would have a breakdown of Strength 30%, Stamain  60% &amp; Spirit 20%, and mana would have a breakdown of stamina 10%, Intelligence 60&amp;, Spirit 30%.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Wider Effects</span><br />
this would allow us to have a wide varitey of itemisation, with weapons basic properties being enhanced by a characters skills, and also allow us to put attribute modifiers on items (a common feature in mosat MMO and therefore famailiar to the overall community).</p>

<p>The skill system, though given with combat examples and wow attributes(they seemed better suited for examples than EVEs), does not mean combat has to be the focus of the game. With the ability to train any skill, we can have as many, if not more non combat based skills, BUT those skills do need valid uses or characters will never train them.</p>

<p>In regards to folks who are familiar with EVE, the attribute governing skill system is there to remove a major 'flaw' of EVE - the learning skills, which in EVE are the only way to increase a character's attrbitues and the EVE developers (CCP) are well known to dislike them and wish they'd never introduced them in the first place.</p>

<p>I hope this post makes sense. I would love to hear feedback from everyone, so please post away, tear this apart, whatever, I dont mind and in fact, I ask you to tear it apart, better to get a good system from the wor d go than to later be told actually, the system kinda sucks  <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/lol.png" title="Laughing out loud" alt="Laughing out loud" class="smiley-content"/> </p>

<p>Later</p>

<p>Kal</p>

<p>EDIT The examples I've used (and attributes) are just ball park figures - if the system is approaved I will work out the figures properly, but for now, they hopefully get the idea across.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>sorry to add this late...</p>

<p>why are we getting rid of classes? i dont disagree with a level-less system... but classless systems seem to lend themselves more to 'optimization' builds then to roleplay, and i think the focus of the game should be on roleplaying and storytelling from the ground up. to me planescape is very much -not- about hack'n'slash (theres always someone/thing bigger and badder then you are, usually around the next corner). with a class based system, when you make a character you are very obviously taking a -role-... which you then make your own and unique. </p>

<p>also, planescape is a d&amp;d campaign, which has always been a class based system. why (and how) would we make a game to invoke the feel of a game, and ignore one of the premises it was based on?</p>

<p>also, on a slightly different topic, i think we should very much make an effort -not- to be your average MMO, from the very beginning. combat experience should, IMO, take the back seat to other methods. im not saying all combat is bad, but maybe a hybrid system would be more advantageous to our overall goal. like a MUD i played on for awhile gave out experience based on the length and complexity of your emotes and dialog. that obviously wouldnt work for this type of game... but the reputation system suggested could control xp caps on experience earned in anyway (in other words the 'grind' wouldnt matter, your progress would still be more based on your characters belief and devotion). </p>

<p>well thats enough from the newbie for now... sorry if im totally missing something but i thought the best way to get involved would be head first into the deep end.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Just a quick reply - I very much dislike class based systems, and the alternative opens up much greater roleplaying potentials by allowiong creative players to come up with skills cominbations to explain their own hsitories, professions, roles etc.</p>

<p>Planescape was never about the underlying mechanics of dnd, it was about planescape, walking, talking, and not going round hacking and slashing and using classes generally means combat defined classes (and yes, i wasnt exactly thrilled with 4e...)</p>

<p>What I would like to aim for would be a combination of EVE online and what Cidedal of Sorcery are promising (tho that too develops at a snails pace), where we have a sandobx MMO which perople find their own motivations, plus each character has a unique story element which CoS is promising</p>

<p>And yes, combat shouldn't be the sole focus</p>

         <p>Generally speaking, the games I have played that don't emphasize class have a very difficult time differentiating characters, particularly at later stages (except for appearance and maybe gear). In an environment like an MMO (or any computer-based game), the number of options in any given field (abilities, skills, quests, rewards) are finite, and long-term players will steadily decrease the number of new options available to them the longer they play even one character. This makes replayablility problematic, and we would likely see a drop in player population after a relatively short time. People play the games to have fun, but if they have seen/done/been it all already, they don't have motivation to fire up a new character just to hit the same old stuff, and the PSO community will feel it as Sigil's population wastes away.</p>

<p>Now, distinct-feeling classes can spice that up a bit. It doesn't have to be hard and fast, necessarily, but disallowing, say, a fighter "build" from being able to cast spells or stealth around without belief-dependent abilities allows for more play options in the long run.  A diplomat build would be disallowed heavy weapons but be able to talk circles around the opposition.  A Macgyver build is able to more fully utilize the environment, a caster casts spells, a rogue can sneak and steal (or optionally, stab and grab) and so on, allowing different methods of achieving even the goals of the same quest.</p>

<p>As to level-based construction, I think it can work (and power-leveling can be avoided) by applying one simple principle: Don't make all the cool stuff only for endgame.  The planes are COOL.  Planescape was designed to open them up to lowbies and high-level characters alike because they are just really badass.  Spread the coolness.  Share the love.  Make lowbies thriilled with new experiences, adventures, vistas and acquisitions, don't just tease them with what dreams may come (if they survive/play long enough).  While it is true that PS never relied on the mechanical underpinnings, leveling is a very visible way to measure character progress.  And, unlike many other fantasy environments, Planescape actually has a built-in rationale for why characters of any level can wander around without being horribly murdered every other step.  High-level beasties live "farther away" conceptually, in lands farther removed, physically or philosophically--deeper layers of Hell, loftier heights on Celestia, deeper in Limbo.</p>

<p>That said, I also think a skill-based system has merit.  In Planescape, people have no way to judge how powerful someone is by looking at them, necessarily.  While it is true that in a skill-based system there is no "max level", there is still a break in ability from what is a challenge and what is trivial--and boring.  A very skilled character is really no different from a character of decent level in this regard.  Perhaps gestalting the two concepts would be a good way to increase playability laterally, instead of just up, up, UP...</p>

<p>De-emphasizing combat is a good idea, but it carries a caveat: the less combat someone does, the more of something else they do. Generally, coding for combat is fairly straightforward--write a combat script once, and let the monster just use that same script regardless how many times it fights.  Writing dialogs can be devilishly complex, and much, much more actual coding goes into it, if for no other reason than because it also contains the lines of actual dialog.  This worked fine in Torment, for example, because it was designed with precisely one player in mind, and with a definite end-point for the game.  This is also why NPC interaction falls pretty flat in most current MMOs.  For something as open-ended as an MMORPG, combat is a simple, code-light method of allowing someone to play for as long as they want in that aspect without each interaction needing separate, unique coding.  For endless interaction of a more social nature, much can be gained by simply chatting with other players, who don't need a programmer.  Endless automated NPC social interaction?  A bit more...involved.  </p>

<p>Since Planescape has never been all about killing monsters and taking their stuff, a simple method to emphasize this would be to reward quest completion, not monster/mob kills (though the one may, in fact, facilitate the other).  A system for allowing players to generate their own quests would probably be something to consider, too, allowing players to act as quest-givers, hiring other players to do this or that for them in exchange for a reward.  This may, in fact, be a very organic way to expand the permanent quests in the game, based on a level of popularity or something.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">
