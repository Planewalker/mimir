         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;Azriael&#039;</em> wrote:</div>I'm all for pop-culture inspiration but the "machine for producing an unbeatable army" idea which seems to be popping up here and there seems a little too much like Knights of the old Republic 1 although I guess it could be spun in a new way. </p>

<p>Also, the upper planes already tried something similar with the Quesar (please excuse spelling) and decided it was immoral to force these beings into servitude. </div></p>

<p>Did I say anything about servitude? No. The soldiers who underwent the process would retain their own free will, they'd just have to remain innately Good to remain undefeatable. That's one of the obvious problems with this Ultimate Weapon, you see; what are you going to do with this unbeatable army once it's achieved your goals?</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Come to think of it the abilities of the Quesar and their position in the upper planes could be a good trigger point for an upper planar conflict/ the Quesar could be a component or early generation of the 'ultimate weapon'.</div></p>

         <p>I say that the Undefeatable Army Machine should just be a machine that adds energy to the Modron Energy Pool, resulting in more modrons.  Throw in some celestials in disguise, and you've got undefeatable armies advancing on the Lower Planes- whenever a modron dies, the nearest one of a rank below it is promoted all the way down to monodrones, and a monodrone splits into two.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Celestial module idea:</p>

<p>Instead of the cliched extraplanar invasion, what if the celestials were the ones invading? Some celestial general could discover a plot to uncover some new weapon, and the invasion could be his attempt to destroy it. Of course, the PCs have to step in when he starts causing more harm than good. It'd be fun to put in the same elements and portents of "an army from another plane coming to attack our world," because the players wouldn't ever expect it to refer to a leonal and his soldiers.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Hope you don't mind me throwing in my two copper pieces at this point:</p>

<p>I still see plenty of scope for more physical conflict in the Peace War. There are some pretty militant celestials up there after all, only holding back because of uncertainty and the fear of pausing the Blood War. </p>

<p>I imagine a great deal of time being taken up by more militant celestials in training and preparing for battle, but all conducted under a strict code of honour and non-lethality that shouldn't be a problem for <span style="font-style:italic">any </span>Good exemplar (at least under normal circumstances). </p>

<p>What I have in mind is something like the duels between sword schools (and their attendant philosophies) that occurred in both Eastern and Western martial arts, as well as full 'mock' battles such as those practised by the zulu peoples, Arthurian chivalric tourneys, and the 'honourable warfare' of the <span style="font-weight:bold">Dharmayuddha </span>code from ancient India [FYI: well worth checking out on <span style="font-style:italic">Wikipedia</span>]. The latter would sit particularly well with the Lawful Good but often-warring Vedic pantheon.</p>

<p>It would definitely be important to differentiate this from the bloody violence of the fiendish conflict however. These warriors are the embodiment of honour, valour, and justice after all!</p>

<p>Each duel or battle would be as much about belief as about physical combat, with teams having to be assembled by persuasion, reasoning, or rhetoric. There would also be 'psychic duels' (and verbal ones) before the physical fight. Specific upper planar fighting styles might also be worked out for these tournaments, so that combat was a literal expression of the combatant's beliefs, used to accompany the more cerebral arguments. </p>

<p>And of course, large gatherings of Celestials make a good opportunity for trade and politics. I see these tournaments as great social events as well, full of pageantry and ceremony, where celestials can be praised and promoted before their peers, where conflicts and disputes between Angels can be settled peaceably, and where saints and Smith Gods can show off the latest weapons in the fight against evil.</p>

<p>Just the sort of place where the Powers of Good might send their mortal servants as well, for aid and inspiration.</p>

          Celestials should take back seat        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>It seams to me that makeing Celestials the primary players in an Upper Plane Conflict is too much like the Blood War.  Personally, I think that the Celestials should be more concerned with the well-being of non-evil life in the planes, and the fostering of Good through them than with simply taking on the Fiends.  To this end, I think that they would generally see the various good religions of the planes as the best tools for achieving this goal, and would therefore be working to support the goals of good Powers and their respective religions.  Going at it from this angle can then give the Powers a greater role in the setting; indeed I've thought that for too long they've been merely part of the background.</p>

<p>Here's an example of how I'd go about this (taken from a campaign story-arch I intend to use in the near future):</p>

<p>In the beginning there were two powerful entities that were of the spirit of stone and metal.  One was named Moradin and his sister/wife was named Dvalin.  They were familiar with the many things that crawled through the caverns and walked on the surface.  Some of them made them smile.  Some repulsed them.<br />
  Moradin and Dvalin decided that they would create their own people to live in the earth, and the would be called Dwarves.  The Dwarves were taught how to shape the earth into homes for themselves and to forge the earth into great works of artifice.  The Dwarves were shown the things that crawled through the depths that repulsed their gods and made war on them.<br />
  Years passed, Dwarves flourished, and where their were once only two, a whole pantheon had been born.  But differences began to emerge between Moradin and Dvalin.  Dvalin, now know as "Mind Etcher" taught her mortal children the Arcane arts for with it, she reasoned, the capabilities of Dwarven craftsmanship would be limited only by their imagination.  She taught them to make each of their creations a work of art, and to apply those lessons to their own lives, because distinction and individual greatness leads to the greatness of the entire Dwarven people.  She bolstered friendships with the gods of other races, most notably the Elves and the Human pantheon known as the Aesir, for while they were not of the stone, they did have common ideals (and enemies).<br />
  Moradin (now called "Soul Forger") however, did not trust the power of the Arcane, it was unknown to him and feared that it might have an ill effect on his people.  He believed that his Dwarves should rely solely upon muscle, steel and divine might.  In his view the good of the Dwarven people depends upon the individual placeing the needs of society far above his/her own wishes.  Brute force utilized by well trained armies is the most effective way to strike fear in the hearts of their enemies, and Outsiders(non-Dwarves) may be useful in a pinch but otherwise are to be regarded with suspicion.<br />
  Eventually they came to dwell in seperate Planes.  Moradin built a realm on the slopes of Mount Celestia, and Dvalin in the caverns of Ysgard known as Nidavelir.  Moradin came to Mourn the loss of their love and wished that Dvalin could only see that he had things right, then they could be together and their children would be united.  It was then that Moradin met a strange little fellow with bright red hair.  Although he was an outsider, Moradin found that he came to trust this man.  His new friend gave him a box and told Moradin that he should give this box to his beloved Dvalin and that when she takes out the token inside, all of Moradin's problems would disapear. <br />
  Moradin did as his friend said and pleaded with Dvalin for a chance to win her back to him.  She gave in, and after an evening of romance, Moradin gave the box to Dvalin as a token of his affection.  Delighted, Dvalin took the box, but upon opening it delight turned into horror.  Suddenly, Dvalin froze, and she slowly turned to rock.  However, this was not the stone of the earth from which the two had sprung an eon ago, this was the cold rock that inhabits the Astral.  Dvalin was now dead and her body transported to the Silvery Void.<br />
  Moradin at first was shocked and wracked with guilt over what had transpired, but eventually came to believe that this was for the best.  He took one of his daughters as his new wife, and all mention of Dvalin was outlawed.  Eventually, she was forgotten by all Dwarves save for the highest ranks of the Church of Moradin.<br />
  And so it has been until today, when a young cleric of Moradin stumbles upon evidence of an unheard of dwarven god floating in the Astral, and recieves visions in her dreams.  She is stirring, and the planes will not be the same.</p>

<p>In this storyline (Pre-FW) the various Dwarven Powers, allied Powers,  Factions, and others would take sides in a conflict over the unity of the Dwarven people and the ressurection of Dvalin.  Violent conflict would at first be avoided in favor of trying to convice the opposition of the rightness of their own views, but eventually diplomacy will give way to a massive battle on the very corpse of Dvalin (that happens to be taking place simultaneously with Faction War).  Of course, bringing Her back is only the begining, as She's not exactly in the best of moods (or mental states).</p>

<p>This is the sort of thing I'd like to see more of.  Power v. Power struggles becoming a prominent part of the setting, and I think that using these as a way to bring various Good groups in conflict is full of potential.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Nick - Identify wouldn't have done much against the power of another God. And as far as I understand, the little red-headed fellow was a trickster God, much like Loki (if not him).</p>

<p>Also, Narfi - Although the idea is good, it is too focused on just a single race/pantheon. I don't think it should be more than a reference in the overall Peace War or celestial conflict. I agree that various Good deities should have as much a role in the conflict as the Good exemplars, if not more so, but they should not be racial deities like Moradin.</p>

<p>Again, that's just my opinion.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Yeah, that's exactly who it was.  And the thing in the box?  That's something that Dvalin herself made.  See, it's actually a godly attribute made for her best friend an Elven Dream goddess (I can't remember her name).  So the thing actually put dvalin into a deep sleap that only resembled death.  The Dream goddess owed Loki a big favor and got Dvalin to take part of her esscence and make it into an attribute, and then gave it to Loki.  Loki was doing this because he was commissioned by Powers that wanted to see the Dwarves and Elves weakened.  Of course Loki's tricks have a way of making things turn out better than before..</p>

<p>Also, I was giving this as an example of Inter- and Intra- religious conflict that can shake up the planes.  I was not saying that this exact plotline should be part of it, just food for thought.  It just seems to me that outside of <span style="font-style:italic">Dead Gods</span>, the Powers didn't actually play a big part in the setting.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Edit</span>: <span style="font-style:italic">Excuse the wildly meandering writing style here, I just wrote this without proofreading or looking it over. I literally just tore an idea out of my head and threw it at the paper. If it really catches anyone's interest, tell me and I'll refine it into something more functional.</span></p>

<p>I want to finish what I'm working on before I seriously give wading into someone else's pool a try, but I have what I think is a really interesting idea. It seems like you've all ready got a direction for this thing in mind, though, so my idea might be something to throw on the back-burners (or disregard entirely).</p>

<p>There has been a recent upsurge in the growth of a new good-aligned cult nick-named the <span style="font-weight:bold">Disciples of Bliss</span>. This religion follows no specific God and no specific alignment/ethos version (just plain old good), and is becoming <span style="font-style:italic">wildly</span> successful, because their main selling point is... Bliss.</p>

<p>Literally.</p>

<p>They have bliss on tap, bottled bliss, cured dried bliss, bliss in a box, bliss in a bag, <span style="font-weight:bold">whatever</span> your bliss-requiring needs are. They're almost this hippie-esque cult of peace-loving beatniks, except that they can be very militant and forcible about making sure people have the <span style="font-weight:bold">right</span> to access this bliss. And because they are purely in the business of making people overwhelmingly happy, they are enjoying <span style="font-weight:bold">wild, uncontrollable</span> success. Success that is literally taking followers <span style="font-weight:bold">right out of the hands of the celestials</span>.</p>

<p>Something must be done! We can't have all our followers running off to be happy in a drug-like haze of pure blissfulness all day! This sort of lethargy, as nice as it is, will do nothing constructive and will spell doom for the Multiverse if it continues! But... what <span style="font-weight:bold">can</span> we do? We're not bad guys; we can't just run out and <span style="font-weight:bold">kill</span> the Disciples of Bliss, because its not like they're doing anything particularly <span style="font-weight:bold">evil</span>... But we have to find some way to shake up their ideology, bring it <span style="font-weight:bold">crashing</span> down, while simultaneously being careful to skirt the edge of decency.</p>

<p>Now here's the twist: The Disciples of Bliss are (yeah, big surprise) <span style="font-weight:bold">fucking evil</span>. Not 'ha-ha-we-are-really-clever' Yugoloth style evil. Oh, no--they <span style="font-weight:bold">think</span> they're helping the Multiverse by spreading peace and love, but what they are actually doing is <span style="font-weight:bold">lobotomizing many loyal followers</span> using very precise psionic techniques. The ones who are performing this procedure have been 'lobotomized' themselves, so they don't see what's so wrong with it--they've simply 'removed' their ability to feel miserable or bad about <span style="font-weight:bold">anything</span>, and thereby see the world through rose-filtered lenses--and so they move on to lobotomize more of their loyal followers. See, <span style="font-weight:bold">that's</span> the reward you get for making it to the upper echelon of the Disciples of Bliss... Free lobotomization so you become incapable of even <span style="font-weight:bold">experiencing</span> bad things! They just call it 'Eternal Bliss'.</p>

<p>And actually, the funny thing is, its not like this is some overwhelmingly sinister plot of the Yugoloth, or some fiendish attempt to overthrow the Multiverse... No, the <span style="font-weight:bold">fiends</span> hate these guys too, ever since they started researching ways to turn even fiendish creatures into happy-dappy unicorn-loving heartsy-weartsy cutey-poos (imagine a Tanar'ri who <span style="font-weight:bold">wuvs</span> you and you can see why even the fiends are terrified of these guys). No, this is all the result of a hilarious mishap performed by an overwhelmingly powerful psionicist. His life sucked, he was very depressed, and one day he figured out there was a way to fix this. So he did. And afterwards, he thought, <span style="font-style:italic">"Hey, that was easy. Why don't I fix everyone else?"</span> And so he started fixing people. And <span style="font-weight:bold">they</span> started fixing people. And so on, and so on...</p>

<p>But anyway, the <span style="font-weight:bold">big</span> nastiness comes from the fact that these guys have plans to convert entire <span style="font-weight:bold">sections</span> of the Lower Planes into happy-dappy no-evil-thought zones using some sort of overwhelmingly powerful device that pretty much lobotomizes everyone in an area by broadcasting millions of recently-lobotomized followers' thoughts into the heads of anyone capable of receiving psionic signals. Once the PCs find this out, they might be less hesitant about beating the shit out of the Disciples of Bliss. Or maybe they're still hesitant, because it's not like the Disciples of Bliss are really <span style="font-weight:bold">evil</span> people, just that they're doing <span style="font-weight:bold">evil</span> things because they've been programmed to think that this is an incredibly cool service they're performing.</p>

<p>Anyway, I just find it a hilariously quirky plot-line/module. The very balance of the Multiverse's ethos is at risk... Because of hippie flower-children who are going to broadcast <span style="font-weight:bold">happy thoughts</span> straight into the Abyss.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Imagine the sheer unbalance and disruption it could cause. I mean, its been pointed out time and time again that the Blood War is a necessity, and that the Celestials aren't going to screw with it any time soon because its keeping the fiends busy. Now imagine what happens if one entire side turns into kitten-lovers overnight.</p>

<p>For a while, there's complete chaos... And then Lawful Evil <span style="font-weight:bold">wins</span>.</p>

<p>Asmodeus and his pals use the momentum of their victorious army to singlehandedly wipe out the Disciples of Bliss overnight (they were pansies anyway) and continue on to the next conquest: Those kitten-loving <span style="font-weight:bold">celestials</span>.</p>

<p>But this doesn't have to be a catastrophic event. I was just taking it to an extreme. Really, its fine to keep it at 'they're stealing our followers!' and trying to find a way to deal with it that isn't overtly violent, or go so far as the discovery of their lobotomization of their worshippers (maybe a PC's relative has joined the cult) and the PCs trying to stop what they see as perfectly pleasant work.</p>

<p>Actually trying to broadcast Love-Beams into the Abyss is... Well, it's a little extreme.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Rather than a group that means good but is really doing evil, a group that does good that has unpleasant consequences.</p>

<p>The [insert name here] are a sect that hails from the Prime, where they would travel from world to world, destroying utopias. Their reasoning is that while a societyis a utopia, they cannot grow and improve themselves. However, they aren't brutal savages or sadists, simply burning a society to the ground teaches them nothing. They destroy utopias by exploiting the flaws in the society to cause it to break down. In their words, "from the death of joy comes wisdom". Recently, they found a portal to the Upper Planes, and promptly set about their attempts at bring down the assorted celestial societies. Unsurpisingly, the celestials are divided as to whether to oppose the sect or support them. Those who support them say that if their gambit works, the celestials would rise from the ashes better and wiser than before. Those that oppose them say that their success will weaken Good, and will give the fiends many opportunities to wreak havok. Both sides are right, to a degree.</p>

<p>They've also encountered the Harmonium, and have quickly become deadly enemies of them. You can guess why.</p>

<p>Most members of the sect itself are NG, with the occasional LG or CG.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I'm going to babble a little bit about this because frankly the whole subject is fascinating to me.</p>

<p>Your idea is overlapping ethical behavior with ethical idealism (ex: saving people's lives versus pursuing Justice), which is one of the things D&amp;D sucks with. </p>

<p>DMs have a little wiggle room, but morality in D&amp;D is basically black-and-white. Alignment is what you are doing, not what you will do or intend to do. Destroying utopian societies is a pretty evil practice by D&amp;D standards, even if you're going to help them rebuild and become stronger. I mean, <span style="font-style:italic">people die</span> when societies crumble. Especially utopian ones. Killing people for the greater good (burning down a city to protect others from plague, for instance) is evil. DMs will use these sorts of situations to turn Paladins into Ex-Paladins. Because in D&amp;D, there always is an alternative--flying wish-granting monkeys could show up and save everyone's ass. Hey, you never know. </p>

<p>D&amp;D's ethos measures immediate results, not long-term ones. Pursuing the 'Greater Good' (with a capital G) is like pursuing any ideal (Justice, Vengeance, Honor). It's squarely in the neutral-ville, sometimes bleeding over towards evil if you're ruthless about it. It doesn't matter if this ideal is good, because you may very well be committing atrocities along the way to reach it. And in D&amp;D, what makes you good is what you are doing <span style="font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">right now</span></span>. Unfair? Maybe, but that's the system.</p>

<p>In short, when encountering a plague-infested town, good guys try to heal the sick and minimize their pain, neutral guys either ignore it or burn it down so the sickness doesn't spread, and evil guys take the oppurtunity to steal all their stuff.</p>

<p>Anyway, an interesting way to add another dimension to this might be to have the group split into two factions: the Breakers and the Builders. One would be neutralish/evil society-crippling Doomguard veterans, while the other provides humanitarian aid and societal reconstruction. They would have an antagonistic symbiotic relationship.</p>

<p>As a sidenote, in most D&amp;D campaigns, violently annihilating an evil society isn't evil at all. Even though <span style="font-style:italic">many</span> more innocents will be dying (children, the infirm, etcetera). I mean, how many adventurers are actively committing genocide against the goblins? How many goblin children are starving in the winter because their fathers and mothers are dead?</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

Now, Good + Evil = Neutral. These guys may have Good intentions and end up doing Good in the long run, but if they have to do Evil to get there then their Alignment, if not their idealogy, will be Neutral with Good tendancies.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>But they are doing much more Good in the long run, and that more than cancels what little Evil there might be.</p>

<p>In any case, they're not actually doing the killing. They're just picking away at the cracks in society, and watching as it crumbles.</p>

<p>In any case, the very fact that they can cause such debate is a reason why they should be included.</p>

<p>Remember that Good doesn't neccessarily care about if you're happy, or alive for that matter. Any celestials that die will merge with their plane and strengthen it, and they'll be killed by other celestials of their own free will.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>So you're saying that Shemeska's Baernaloth Severeth Na’Halastrian, The Wanderer is also Good because he brings faulty societies down, letting other better societies take their place? I disagree... if you work toward the fall of a society, you're not doing anything productive or helpful.

<p>Not really. Unless I missed a few posts, the debate is simply between you (the one who put forth the idea in the first place) saying that if your long term intention is Good, then your means of getting there is by definition good, even if in any other situation it would be considered evil. AKA: the end justifys the means.</p>

<p>Then there are a few others saying that are trying to tell you that Alignment in DnD doesn't work that way. I will admit I am part of this second group.</p>

<p>This hardly seems like the Great debate we need for the Upper Planes.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Emphasis mine. Listen, I understand what you're trying to say here, but mechanically, alignments in D&amp;D just don't work like this. Pursing a 'Greater Good' has no more impact on your alignment than pursing 'Justice', or 'Greater Evil', or 'Overdue Library Books'. It's <span style="font-style:italic"><span style="font-weight:bold">flavor-text</span></span>. </p>

<p>The 'Greater Good' you're describing has nothing to do with good-aligned characters. Seriously. You're describing a philosophy, <span style="font-style:italic">not an alignment</span>. I could have a Lawful Evil character who pursued your 'Greater Good'. I <span style="font-style:italic">have</span> had them. They make great villains.</p>

<p>Again, in D&amp;D, what makes you a good guy isn't your philosophy, but what you do. It is <span style="font-style:italic">action</span> based. Destroying a society because you believe this will result in a stronger society is no more 'good' than shooting people in the face because you believe this will result in them learning how to dodge bullets.</p>

<p>Alignment in D&amp;D is a boolean operator. Either you're good or you're not good. If you're destroying a good society, you're not good. Doesn't matter what your justification is--you're destroying a good society. It doesn't matter what you <span style="font-style:italic">think</span> this will do.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Oh, yes, The Great Hippo. Definately. However, you're focusing on the short-term results of their actions, and ignoring the long-term- something that Good itself would be much more concerned with. By removing the utopian societies, they are ultimately saving lives, by bringing the society down in a controlled fashion. This isn't a hypothetical- they've got thousands of years of experience doing this, and divinations to track the consequences of their actions to ensure a net Good effect.</p>

<p>I'm not talking about philosophy here. Remember that all actions are defined by their both intentions and consequences, and that all actions have both short-term and long-term results. They are doing this with Good intentions, and while their actions do have slight Evil short-term consequences, these are greatly outweighed by the Good long-term consequences.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>To me this argument looks like a conflict between your <span style="font-style:italic">Alignment </span>and your <span style="font-style:italic">Beliefs</span>. Not to state the obvious, but Belief is something that you choose to have, while Alignment is a method by which the universe (or OOC: the game) categorises you based on your actions.</p>

<p>Anyone could believe that bringing down Utopias is ultimately for the greater good, but they will be judged on both the methods they use <span style="font-style:italic">and </span>the spirit of their goals - and also how they react emotionally to the world around them; especially to any events that they cause. Everyone is the hero of the story in their own heads, but the universe might very well judge them differently. I'm assuming that these guys aren't CN balmies, however.</p>

<p>One problem here is that you're both dealing in generalisations (though I appreciate why). I think we need to develop Nick’s group a little more specifically, and in doing so resolve how we keep these guys Good while pitting them against the Upper Planes, which is the essence of the idea (good opponants for good PCs).</p>

<p>One problem is that Utopias are by definition perfect (that’s why they don’t exist in the real word). If you believe a “utopia” it's not perfect, then its because you disagree with the fundamental principles on which its based. If you’re dealing with a Lawful Good society, and you’re definitely of Good alignment yourself, than the most likely explanation is that you disagree with the Lawful part (the “unchanging = stagnation” argument). You’re not trying to “bring down” society, just change it for the better… a perfectly fine Chaotic Good agenda (challenging the establishment and “anti-law feelings” are generally both Chaotic acts).</p>

<p>If on the other hand you have more of a <span style="font-style:italic">political </span>difference with the “utopia”, you could easily be equally as Lawful Good as the society you’re trying to fundamentally change; such as a Paladin trying to show the population of Mount Celestia what its really like for the rest of the universe so the Archons will finally get off their arses and do something about it. </p>

<p>Part of Goodness is looking at the Greater Good, whether you choose to follow that path or go for the immediate good in any situation (“immediate good” strikes me as very CG in alignment, like the Eladrin and Asura, but there’s nothing that says you can’t be NG or LG and also hold that opinion!)</p>

<p>Celestials and other Good Guys do “harm” for the greater good all the time – Celestials abstain from massed attacks on the fiends because uniting them against a common cause would be a very bad for the universe, for example. They also let fiends walk around freely in Sigil without attacking them, and on a more mortal level, killing someone is obviously wrong yet adventurers kill hundreds of people in their careers, not all of them dedicatedly evil (was <span style="font-style:italic">every </span>orc really irredeemable?) </p>

<p>The question then becomes “how far am I prepared to go to achieve my aims” and that’s what will ultimately decide the alignment of the Utopia-destroyers – although its likely that several alignments exist within their ranks (just like there are in the Harmonium, which is a pretty good comparison; firmly LG motivation, some rather dubious and tyrannical actions in its name).</p>

<p>To return to the example above, I can happily see our Paladin “bringing down” the communities of Mount Celestia by getting up on his soapbox to convince the people to side with him, fervently opposing the current leaders from within the political system, even kidnapping members of the aristocracy and taking them on a tour of the Lower Planes to prove just how bad things can be… But I don’t see him teleporting in rampaging orc warbands or opening the gates for a fiendish attack. </p>

<p>You can’t do <span style="font-style:italic">anything </span>in the name of Greater Good – “the road to Hell paved with good intentions” after all. How you go about your aims is <span style="font-style:italic">as </span>important (but not <span style="font-style:italic">more </span>so) to your Alignment as the final outcome, because in the end, you don’t chose your alignment, the universe does.</p>

<p>The final verdict on whether these berks are good or bad depends on the blend of both the arguments I'm hearing here – and if these guys are really good, they should be having the same debate that you guys are <span style="font-style:italic">all the time</span>.</p>

<p>I really think the “utopia destroyers” would need more defining, but I think the idea itself is sound.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I think ripvanwormer might mean that not every economist thinks the New Deal pulled us out of the depression (actually, quite a few think it made it worse), FDR's real motives are suspect (the institution of Social Security allowed for tighter control and identification over the population),  and any sense of entitlement you believe Americans might have can come from other sources.</p>

<p>To quote that other guy: Your example is heavily disputed on every count. By <span style="font-style:italic"><span style="font-weight:bold">everyone</span></span>.</p>

<p>Regardless, this is not a helpful direction to take the discussion. The historical significance of FDR's New Deal isn't going to help us determine whether or not the means can justify the ends in the D&amp;D ethos.<br />
<div style="text-align:center">_____________________________</div><br />
I find morality in D&amp;D absolutely fascinating; unlike the real world, it's actually a physical part of your being. People who stab nice people in the face show up on a Paladin's EvilDar, they take extra damage from effects that target evil creatures, so on... It means the Multiverse <span style="font-weight:bold">acknowledges</span> a system of ethics, and reinforces it with tangible consequences and benefits. That's really crazy cool stuff (to me, anyway).</p>

<p>But who's the guy sitting up on a throne dictating what's good and what's evil? The answer is pretty simple: Farmer Joe. The planes are shaped by Farmer Joe's beliefs, and so it just makes sense that ethics are too. The dichtonomy of Law versus Chaos and Evil versus Good are merely representative of Farmer Joe's worldview, which the Multiverse reinforces.</p>

<p>The important thing about this to remember is that Farmer Joe isn't very smart. Stabbing orcs in the face is okay, because orcs have tried to stab Farmer Joe in the face in the past. Stabbing other farmers in the face? Definitely a no-no. So, for the good guys, stabbing farmers in the face isn't allowed.</p>

<p>Basically, if you couldn't explain your actions to Farmer Joe in such a way that he would understand that they are ultimately for the better good, it isn't a 'good action'. And Farmer Joe's not going to understand your thousand-year old war against utopian societies. All Farmer Joe sees is that he can't sell his crops or buy his seeds, because all the stores are closed thanks to the economy crashing. Farmer Joe's gonna starve, and in Farmer Joe's eyes, that means you're evil. At best, <span style="font-style:italic">neutral</span>.</p>

<p>And the Multiverse is on Farmer Joe's side.</p>

<p>D&amp;D ethics aren't a game of karmic retribution. You don't get to 'make up' for bad deeds by assuring us that these deeds will cause greater good deeds in the future. Stabbing people in the face <span style="font-style:italic">now</span> because you think it will make things wonderful <span style="font-style:italic">a hundred years down the road</span> is just too complex for D&amp;D alignments to understand. This isn't a sophisticated measuring tool of morality; this is just the way <span style="font-style:italic"><span style="font-weight:bold">farmers perceive the Multiverse</span></span>.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Um... Can we all head off a dangerous Topic and ignore the last three posts? Narfi Ref, I can see where you got the idea. However, I think all the posters on this thread can agree that it would be a shame for this thread, with all the potential we have floating around, getting locked because of a hot topic debate that doesn't have anything to do with the setting anyway.</p>

<p>So, that leaves us somewhere about... here:</p>

<p>Right - some dispute this, including the way it frames the debate. And not everyone agrees that a sense of entitlement is horrible. As I said, all of your points are disputed. I don't think this is the place for me to go into it any further, but the Great Hippo covered the Great Depression part. I'm not trying to convince you of anything, just noting that your example isn't as clear-cut as you might think.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>I think belief is power, and can certainly change the nature of alignments in D&amp;D/Planescape, but I think the relationship between alignments, the Outer Planes, and belief is circular: Farmer Joe's beliefs can and do shape the behavior of fiends, celestials et al, but the behavior of fiends, celestials, et al also shape the beliefs of Farmer Joe. </p>

<p>That is to say, the inhabitants of the Outer Planes can take an active role in shaping their own destinies. That is largely what the Blood War is about; yugoloths, baatezu, tanar'ri, and others attempting to define, for the entire multiverse, exactly what it means to be evil. If the tanar'ri are doing well in the war, Chaos and Evil across the multiverse increase in power, the tanar'ri themselves become physically and magically more potent, and the soul of Farmer Joe, representing the mean average of the beliefs of every sapient on every plane (not just the Prime), becomes just a little more Abyssal. </p>

<p>Every time a gate town slides, the cosmic balance shifts. Every time a celestial is corrupted or a fiend brought to virtue, the cosmic scales move a significant amount, and everything and everyone changes.</p>

<p>So if a group of celestials want to make it so that the cosmos recognizes that complete pacifism is the only true path to Good, they can try to do that, and have a chance of succeeding. They can go the elaborate route of starting religions and schools - perhaps sects and factions - to convince as many people as possible that this is the case, or they could be more direct, perhaps encouraging the crucial upper planar realms, sites, and celestial paragons devoted to concepts like war, punishment, or self-defense slide into the lower planes, so that the force of Good know longer has those concepts within it.</p>

<p>Ideas, in Planescape, exist not just in the heads of those who are aware of them. They're physical places and even people. They're sects and factions and powerful entities; they're monsters, realms, and planes of existence. A campaign set in the Outer Planes exists simultaneously inside Farmer Joe's head - while individuals have free will, the collective (un)consciousness can be manipulated directly.</p>

<p>Celestials, fiends, slaadi and so forth have free will as well. They interpret the alignments they champion as best as they can; if they're wrong - and they <span style="font-style:italic">can</span> be wrong - they'll become cut off from their source of power, from the thing that makes up every atom of their beings. Perhaps they'll be able to find another source and slowly change their nature and physical make-up to reflect their new philosophies, or perhaps they'll just waste away and die. Perhaps, chagrined, they'll return to their original path.</p>

<p>It's certainly possible to be good and to make bad decisions, and I agree with Narfi Ref's larger point even if I don't agree with his example. Good intentions can have disastrous consequences; this is one of Planescape's major themes, since moral ambiguity can make for better gaming, especially in a game about philosophy.</p>

<p>The purity of the metaconcept may or may not take a back seat to the needs of the plot, depending on how picky the people you game with are.</p>

<p>The specific example at contention here - celestials destroying utopian societies - is possible, depending on the celestials in question, particularly since <span style="font-style:italic">true</span> utopias are unlikely outside the Upper Planes. This doesn't mean they'd remain celestials, of course. </p>

<p>I agree that the ends do not justify the means in D&amp;D, but the ends can <span style="font-style:italic">mitigate</span> the means to some extent. Fiends may be willing to use good means to an evil end, and celestials may reluctantly employ less-than-good means if the cause is righteous enough. To do so is doubtless physically painful to them, but they may endure it if their goal is very important.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Rip, although I agree with you, I have to say that outsider must be <span style="font-style:italic">very careful</span> when nudging the balance. The fiends, with their Blood War, just got lucky to have it all balanced out. If a celestial goes and tries to change the concept of Good by destroying utopias, on the other hand, that celestial's actions will be considered Evil by the ubiquitous Farmer Joe. Although, if everything works as planner, their actions might justify their means in the future, by that time they will have fallen and be long set on the path of Evil. Once you begin slipping, it's hard to clamber back up. Even if their original starting point goes from being considered, by most, as Evil to being considered Neutral or even Good, the fact that they did, indeed, turn Evil at one point will most likely lead them commit Evil acts later on. As you said, outsiders are as influenced by their alignment as they influence it.</p>

<p>Also, it seems that this thread has come full circle (anybody else notice that the three planar laws hold up really well in real life?). We went from having a Peace War, to having an Armageddon weapon, and now back to a Peace War.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>I did completely forget to factor in the Celestials (and other conceptual beings) actually taking a big role in shaping what good and evil are themselves, by winning the heart (or the nightmares) of Farmer Joe.</p>

<p>The idea of celestials who actually willingly accept that evil acts along the road to a greater good create indelible stains upon their souls gave me this idea for the Utopian-destroying good-guys:</p>

<p>Long ago during a crucial battle between Good and Evil, a celestial general found himself faced with a perplexing problem: Lose the fight with honor, or perform an act so obscene and depraved that he would be Damned forever. Knowing that failure would mean an even greater evil, he chose the second option. In doing so, he sacrificed more than merely his life-- he sacrificed his innocence.</p>

<p>Since that day, others have followed him. Celestials call them the Unclean Ones; fiends just call them 'those $#%$@# <span style="font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">bastards</span></span>!'. Neither likes to talk about them because they represent an abomination to <span style="font-style:italic">both</span> sides.</p>

<p>Their alignments are always Neutral, but they are all dedicated to the Greater Good. To them, no sacrifice is too great to create a Multiverse without evil. Not even their souls. In battle, they will use dishonorable tactics--even fiendish ones--without batting an eye. They will sacrifice lives of good people to accomplish their ends. They'll even see the destruction of entire planes of existence if they think it will bring them one step closer to that ultimate goal of a Multiverse pure of taint. And when they finally accomplish their holy task, when all of the Multiverse is purged of evil, there will only be one stain left to annihilate--themselves.</p>

<p>They only destroy innocent life when there is no other way to come closer to their ends--after all, every innocent death weakens the strength of the Greater Good. But they won't hesitate to kill you if doing so will put the Greater Good even one inch ahead of the game. Some people call them zealots, but they're not like the Harmonium--although they are <span style="font-style:italic">vicious</span>, they are not stupid. They are very careful to minimize any damage they might do.</p>

<p>Where are they getting their power from? They have been forcibly cut off from goodness, so how are they still operating? Some say the celestials <span style="font-style:italic">still</span> back them up, and that Good-aligned Gods quietly feed them the magic they require to exist, because they acknowledge that as much as they might hate the hypocrisy they represent, they are <span style="font-style:italic">necessary</span>. Others say that the Unclean Ones have actually found ways to tap into fiendish energy, and many lie on the verge of being truly corrupted into fiends. A few believe they have found a Power all for themselves who believes whole-heartedly in their philosophy.</p>

<p>But the important thing to note here is that they are not trying to convince you that their way is the best way. They are trying to convince the Multiverse that the <span style="font-style:italic">Good Guy's</span> way is the best way... Using unscrupulous means to get this point across. They are absolute hypocrites--lying, cheating, stealing, and killing to convince the Multiverse that Good is the best way... And they know this. They see it as necessary.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic"><span style="font-weight:bold">These</span></span> guys could be Utopia destroyers. They could be a lot more, too.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>That is to say, the inhabitants of the Outer Planes can take an active role in shaping their own destinies. That is largely what the Blood War is about; yugoloths, baatezu, tanar'ri, and others attempting to define, for the entire multiverse, exactly what it means to be evil.</div></p>

<p>Absolutely. One of the prime tasks of the Loths (or what they want you to think is their prime task  <img src="http://planewalker.com/sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/smile.png" title="Smiling" alt="Smiling" class="smiley-content"/>) is to maintain the current popular perception of evil because if that perception changed then Loths, as they are now, would cease to exist.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>From what I understand, these guys basically find another source of power. A fiend repenting is now getting his existence-juice (whatever you want to call it) straight from the holy tap, while a fallen archon gets it from the blasphemy tap. Which brings up an interesting idea for an Ultimate Doomsday Weapon of Heaven: Quintessence. No, not the psi-material; the very <span style="font-style:italic">stuff</span> that belief, faith, and ideas are made of; purified and untainted. Or is this a little too Limbo-ish?</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Iavas said:</span><br />
<div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>That would be almost like creating a new alignment, and that could throw the entire Wheel out of balance. Just think of the possibilities. Jemorille is probably salivating at the thought.</div></p>

<p>The interesting part (to me, anyway) is that they're not trying to sell you something, they're not trying to convince you that their way is right, and they're not even looking for your understanding.</p>

<p>They wholly accept that their methodology is evil. They <span style="font-style:italic">expect</span> to burn in eternal torment for their sins. They <span style="font-style:italic">expect</span> to be reviled, hated, and hunted down to the ends of the earth by the good-hearted. To them, any society that wouldn't do this is a society that must be changed. In their ideal society, their faction would be <span style="font-style:italic">annihilated</span>. Their ultimate goal is to create a Multiverse where <span style="font-style:italic">they cannot exist</span>.</p>

<p>To them, that is the sacrifice they are willing to make to see to it that those who <span style="font-style:italic">are</span> good-hearted see their dreams come to fruition. They're like back-stabbing murderous political aides making sure their clients--fair, true-hearted, <span style="font-style:italic"><span style="font-weight:bold">good</span></span> folk who would never condone or even willingly profit from these nefarious deeds--succeed in their goal of a better tomorrow. A better tomorrow that they'll never see, because they'll be busy rotting in jail (or in this case, oblivion/hell). Martyrdom, taken to the next level.</p>

<p>But yeah, it would be treacherously easy for one of them to step just a little too far and go fiendish. This is one of the reasons I imagine that they're a Lawful faction; they are <span style="font-style:italic">rigorous</span> about weeding out the weak-minded and those incapable of walking the line without crossing it. Members of their organization who step too far are cut down brutally and without mercy.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>You know, that might be a much better idea. What I mean is that what I'm suggesting are a bunch of perpetually grim self-destructive martyrs who take things <span style="font-style:italic">way</span> too seriously, and frankly, the Multiverse is nearly overflowing with that type.</p>

<p>Someone who doesn't take things as seriously and doesn't qualify as true Good just because they lie, cheat, and steal to make sure true Good <span style="font-style:italic">does</span> succeed might be a little more fun and light-hearted.</p>

<p>Well, they'd still do some pretty damn grim stuff, but they might not be complete assholes about it.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

          Brainstorming session, part 3:  the upper planes        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Its great to see so many thoughts on this topic, particularly because making the Upper Planes more interesting has always been a goal of mine. However, its clear that the discussion has gone down a tangeant on the nature of good itself, and what actions may be taken in name of the greater good. Please forgive me, as it seems I have a bit of a tirad to make on the subject. <img src="http://planewalker.com/sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/smile.png" title="Smiling" alt="Smiling" class="smiley-content"/> </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">The Nature of Good</span><br />
It should be noted that "the greatest good" isn't something all good people and all celestials strive for. Specifically, Lawful Good is concerned with doing good while being restrained by a code of ethics of what is proper. Chaotic Good seeks to do good without abusing or restricting the freedom and choices of others. Both alignments are thus ethically restricted, whereas I would argue Neutral Good is most focused on achieving the greatest good possible, perhaps irregardless of the methods. </p>

<p>Elysium itself is a perfect example of this; brainwashing people into staying on the plane seems like an immoral action, does it not? Yet there, it actually does promote the most good, a fact that cannot be argued out of game because it is the plane of greatest good. As you'll see in the Elysium writeup, the plane has also sealed away many great societies at their peak and locked them away from the rest of the multiverse. Such unrequested "imprisonment" could be seen as wrong, even evil, and certainly not kind, but if those nations someday are responsible for bringing peace and prosperity to all the multiverse,  then who is to say it wasn't the greatest good to be had?</p>

<p>Now, the Harmonium may be a counterexample, as their efforts on Arcadia to brainwash berk's to the Hardhead way of thinking shifted an entire layer of Arcadia to Mechanus. Was the brainwashing methods/goals so immoral as to lose all pretence of serving good? Or was it the fact that the Harmonium wasn't instructing people to be good so much as be Hardheads, and in the end they were serving their own order and vision?</p>

<p>Too much ambiguity and confusion arises when looking at good from a modern perspective vs. a medieval fantasy perspective, as well as when adding in Lawful and Chaotic. Such arguments become even more difficult when the alignment system is viewed as an objective guideline which <span style="font-weight:bold">must</span> be adhered to, whereas it should be accepted that characters may not strictly adhere to their alignment either because of ignorance or specific character quirks. Good people can be prideful, vain, racist, and even cruel. Evil people can be generous, merciful, and love. Good rulers can invade neighboring kingdoms and even commit genocide. Evil rulers can bring prosperity to their kingdom and make their people strong. The existence of objective morality does not mean characters need to have the full approval of the multiverse behind them in order to keep their alignment, particularly when the nature of good, lawful, evil, and chaotic can be changed by belief.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Controversial Good</span><br />
There have been a couple different ideas for contentious groups of Good people. I say use them all (well, after some fleshing out anyways). Controversial Good groups are exactly what the Upper Planes need, issues that bring good people to blows and give rise to the circumstances which draw adventurers in. Every sect that breaks the mold of the civil, restrained order of Good completely trapped by their own morality adds spice to the realms. Not even the exemplar are truly perfect or agree with one another, and when considering the growing influence of planars and the factions/sects themselves, these groups should invite questions of ethics and morality instead of being limited by them.</p>

<p>And while its common to consider the exemplar of Good as kind, protective, honorable, and overall ideal people, that needn't be the case. Angelic beings in the past have been seen as wrathful and without mercy. The archangels of <span style="font-weight:bold">In Nomine</span> are often cold, harsh taskmasters, while angels sometimes trick/force their servants into aiding them. In <span style="font-weight:bold">Demon: The Fallen</span> the angels chose to keep humans ignorant beasts rather than disobey God's decrees. In the Buffyverse the Powers of Good virtually never lend a hand on Earth despite the constant encroachment of Evil and the sacrifices made by mortals. Chaotic Good exemplar may employ under-handed schemes to weaken their enemies, even outright treachery and betrayal. Good exemplar of any variety may have short tempers, be intolerate of certain beliefs that they find particularly loathsome, or believe that disputes are truly best resolved by combat.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Returning to the original topic, the Peace Wars, I wanted to share my own storyline that I came up with about two-three years ago. It picked up after a Planescape adventure called <span style="font-style:italic">Rapture</span> (its officialness I am uncertain of) where a single Lawful Good deity ruled a Prime world. The god was slightly insane and was sending the souls of anyone who did not conform to his strict moral requirements to the Abyss. The adventure ended with the PCs facing the option of invading the deity's realm and fighting through his celestial servants in order to destroy the god (the details of how escape me, but I recall it would be require one of the characters truyl sacrificing themself). In any case, with the god dead it would leave a Prime world without any deities overseeing it. That's where the conflict arises.</p>

<p>The "ultimate weapon" artifact in this has nothing to do with evil. Its ability is to seal of Prime worlds from the planes (think the Grey of <span style="font-weight:bold">Dark Sun</span>), meaning that no one could gain petitioners from the world and gods/exemplar could not interfere there. Here are my notes on the story:</p>

<p>o	The world is left without its single god; fear and chaos begin to grow among the primes. The world is seen as the perfect opportunity to create paradise without the taint of evil<br />
o	Lawful factions of aasimon and archon led by Azel of the dead god return to the world<br />
o	The eladrin step in, asserting that the aasimon have done enough damage and that the people should be allowed to develop on their own<br />
o	Chaotic and neutral aasimon arrive, demanding access to the world as well. Azel refuses to allow them to interfere.<br />
o	Debates begin on what should be done with the freed world, and the celestials become split over the issue<br />
o	Baatezu aid Azel to find the artifact and move it to Mount Celestia<br />
o	Strategic fights begin in the Upper Planes between aasimon factions and asuras<br />
o	The powers of the Upper Plane prevent planar travel<br />
o	Azel of the aasimon threatens to use the artifact to cut off the world from the other celestials, meanwhile planning to ascend to divinity<br />
o	The asuras redouble their efforts with eladrin support to take the artifact<br />
o	The Parliament tries to bring an end to the fighting. Azel refuses to surrender the artifact, and the other races refuse to give in to the aasimon<br />
o	An asuras slays a archon, bringing bloodshed to the war<br />
o	The war becomes all out as the aasimon and archons strike back while the eladrin and asuras try to stop Azel from using the artifact<br />
o	The guardinals begin seven day warning<br />
o	The Upper Planes begin slipping into neighboring planes<br />
o	Baatezu begin supplying Azel and his followers<br />
o	The eladrin manage to steal the artifact from Mount Celestia and retreat while the aasimon and archons give chase<br />
o	The rilmani journey to speak with the guardinals<br />
o	The final battle wages on the first layer of Elysium<br />
o	The guardinals rise to leadership</p> <div class="dice_rolls">
