          IMPORTANT DISCUSSION: What drives the Hordlings?        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>@Iavas: Now let's see how we can handle your recent notes...</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>'Faces of Evil', on the other hand, says that larvae can appear anywhere, not just the Gray Waste, and are simply the spirits of particularly evil mortals. </p>

<p>Personally, I would ignore that latter bit.</div></p>

<p>I wouldn't. I remember having seen this used here and there, and I myself even used it in an adventure once, a massive larvae herd in Baator. As usual, we shouldn't change old stuff where we risk messing with the creative work that has been published by now.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>It just conflicts too greatly with the fact that on Baator petitioners are said to appear as nupperibos and in the Abyss as manes.</div></p>

<p>I never saw that as a conflict. Other sources describe Baator petitioners as taking on a variety of shapes. Planes of Law, for example, says that the City of Dis has petitioners working in the city, and those are neither larvae nor nupperibo. Also remember the pillar of skulls in Torment / Well of Worlds.</p>

<p>In my understanding, it's like that: The really weak Baator petitioners appear as "normal" petitioners, possibly keeping a lot of their original shape, or whatever the baatezu force them into. Those souls with a good deal of evil in them, but not yet ripe for baatezu ranks, appear as larvae, until they are ready to turn into nupperibo. And the really nasty ones appear as nupperibo right away.</p>

<p>As far as I can see, that's kind of the only way of keeping all the different existing sources correct. <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/wink.png" title="Eye-wink" alt="Eye-wink" class="smiley-content"/></p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>There should, indeed, be two kinds of larvae - the weaker chaotic/lawful evil ones and the stronger neutral evil ones. The latter are created by Night Hags' stealing a mortal soul. The former, however, are the byproducts of the Yugoloth cleansing process.</div></p>

<p>Remember that the 'loth cleansing process is a theory, one of those "there may be contradictions" articles. It's one of those things we shouldn't enforce, but leave the decision to the individual DM.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Canonically, hordelings are simply really strong petitioners (PoC), and do not arise from larvae but rather from the mass of shades.</div></p>

<p>Any chance you can post the exact description of what Planes of Conflict says about this point?</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Finally, the way I see the hordeling psyche working is not in conflict between its individuality and horde-will, but rather in a strange balance between these two seemingly opposite forces.</div></p>

<p>Yes, I love this part! Totally agreed! Although...</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>However, they realize that they are weak when compared to your average Baatezu or Tanar'ri or Yugoloth.</div></p>

<p>... that's where I don't agree. I do see members of the Hordling race as varied in power as the other fiendish races, and if I'm not mistaken, that was the common understanding over here (or else the idea of Hordling Lords would be quite absurd).</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div> Its instinct, however, becomes one with that of the horde. Therefore, the horde is driven on one impulse, but each member still has its own unique logical reasoning.</div></p>

<p>This, again is a really really cool way to describe things, and I think we should set this as "project canon".</p>

<p>Of course, that doesn't have to conflict with the idea of some Lurklings giving up their unique reasoning and totally giving themselves into the Horde Will... but it's not a must.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Skall's balls, that's an amazing image. It made me think about what leads up to that:</p>

<p>Grendar leapt at the huge hordeling, cleaving an arm from its shoulder with his einhander blade. With a roar of pain, the hordeling backhanded him into the ranks of his allies and glanced around. After a moment it grabbed a scampering lurkling and jammed it into its bleeding socket. Squealing and squirming, the lurkling liquified and boiled out to regrow the missing limb.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

          IMPORTANT DISCUSSION: What drives the Hordlings?        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;joyblood&#039;</em> wrote:</div><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>'Faces of Evil', on the other hand, says that larvae can appear anywhere, not just the Gray Waste, and are simply the spirits of particularly evil mortals. </p>

<p>Personally, I would ignore that latter bit.</div></p>

<p>I wouldn't. I remember having seen this used here and there, and I myself even used it in an adventure once, a massive larvae herd in Baator. As usual, we shouldn't change old stuff where we risk messing with the creative work that has been published by now.</div></p>

<p>Fair enough. It is just that in some cases the official published canon acquired some slight changes over time, and this was one of those cases. Personally, I was not aware that the larvae appearing in herds anywhere other than the Gray Waste was used extensively in any product. However I am still rather iffy as to them just being 'normal' petitioners.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;joyblood&#039;</em> wrote:</div><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>It just conflicts too greatly with the fact that on Baator petitioners are said to appear as nupperibos and in the Abyss as manes.</div></p>

<p>I never saw that as a conflict. Other sources describe Baator petitioners as taking on a variety of shapes. Planes of Law, for example, says that the City of Dis has petitioners working in the city, and those are neither larvae nor nupperibo. Also remember the pillar of skulls in Torment / Well of Worlds.<br />
In my understanding, it's like that: The really weak Baator petitioners appear as "normal" petitioners, possibly keeping a lot of their original shape, or whatever the baatezu force them into. Those souls with a good deal of evil in them, but not yet ripe for baatezu ranks, appear as larvae, until they are ready to turn into nupperibo. And the really nasty ones appear as nupperibo right away.<br />
</div></p>

<p>For myself, the natural appearance of the non-natural petitioner form of larvae was always something that needed to be reconciled. Only in 3.5e do the Baatorian petitioners begin appearing as actual humanoids before transformation, and that was WotC's attempt at replacing the larvae. More on this later...</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;joyblood&#039;</em> wrote:</div>
As far as I can see, that's kind of the only way of keeping all the different existing sources correct. <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/wink.png" title="Eye-wink" alt="Eye-wink" class="smiley-content"/> </div></p>

<p>Not always <span style="font-style:italic">entirely</span> possible, ergo my suggestion. If we can make it work, though, sure.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;joyblood&#039;</em> wrote:</div>
<div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>There should, indeed, be two kinds of larvae - the weaker chaotic/lawful evil ones and the stronger neutral evil ones. The latter are created by Night Hags' stealing a mortal soul. The former, however, are the byproducts of the Yugoloth cleansing process.</div></p>

<p>Remember that the 'loth cleansing process is a theory, one of those "there may be contradictions" articles. It's one of those things we shouldn't enforce, but leave the decision to the individual DM.</div></p>

<p>Ah. And here we get down to my conflict about fiendish petitioners. It appears I have subconsciously accepted some fan-based canon (I'm guessing Shemmy's) as official. I am pretty sure that it has been stated <span style="font-style:italic">somewhere</span> officially that the Yugoloths, when cleansed of Law/Chaos by the General of Gehenna, discarded all the metaphysical 'bathwater' into the surrounding petitioners. I simply furthered that by suggesting that aside from just giving out 'dirt', the 'loths also took soul from the plane. Being the only fiendish race that is not born from petitioners, this is a logical conclusion. It can be surmised, therefore, that the weakened petitioners became larvae, rather than the hordes of hordlings, nupperibos, and manes.</p>

<p>Also, the particular difference between 'Dis' petitioners and your average Nupperibo (or default LE petitioner) was adequately explained as the Dis petitioners having a final regret for their misdeeds before death. Perhaps this was only in 3.5e, I'm not sure, but it was very fitting nevertheless.  I would also mention that the more cardinal planes (Baator, Abyss, and I assumed the Wastes) have intrinsically fiendish petitioners. That is, the petitioners that did not belong to a deity were immediately set on the way of fiendish progression either as Nupperibos (later transformed into Lemures so that they become Baatezu rather than Baatorians), Manes, or Hordlings. The less cardinal planes (Carceri, Gehenna, Pandemonium, Acheron) had petitioners with particular psychological or spiritual traits but that did not undergo a specific change from their mortal forms. What I was trying to reconcile was where the larvae, which can be turned into any of the fiendish races and their kitty cats, actually came from. It is official that the Night Hags make them with their ability, but only through much effort and over a period of time. What about the rest? Why are they so common across all the three of the lowest planes? Basically, it boils down to whether or not the Yugoloth involvement in larvae creation was in any way even hinted at in the official canon. Because if it was, no radical changes to my theory are required. Simply say that they appear on all three planes rather than just the Waste. It could also be that the Baatorian larvae herds, as well as any on the other evil planes, were simply brought there through trade and lost or left to wander. After all, even with fiends not everyone finishes their food or fishes the change out from between the couch pillows. </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;joyblood&#039;</em> wrote:</div><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Canonically, hordelings are simply really strong petitioners (PoC), and do not arise from larvae but rather from the mass of shades.</div></p>

<p>Any chance you can post the exact description of what Planes of Conflict says about this point?</div></p>

<p>Note: while transcribing this, I noticed I've been spelling 'hordlings' with an 'e' this entire time and nobody told me. I feel stupid.</p>

<p>"The second race of denizens are the hordlings, the misshapen bastard children of the Gray Waste. Like the mindless armies of lemures and nupperibos on Baator or the endless armies of dretches on the Abyss, the hordlings roam where they will, with little regard for boundaries and civilization. <p> It's thought that hordlings might actually be petitioners, their forms warped and twisted beyond recognition by the evil of the plane and their own twisted sense of self. Perhaps they refused to let the plane break them or to let go of their hatreds and their angers. That, it's thought, is why they're all individuals - because each had its own hostility, and each nursed it to a different end. </p><p> Of course, that would mean millions of berks had the strength to resist the Waste's influence. And that literally uncounted billions of petitioners on the Gray Waste. It's frightening to realize just how many souls have devoted their lives to the pursuit of evil." (Planes of Chaos - Liber Malevolantiae, pp49-50)</p>

<p>There is also, further down, an interesting passage that suggests that Night Hags are really evolved larvae (I believe this was later expanded upon in Dragon Magazine as having to use a larvae during 'reproduction', although don't quote me on that), which does two things. First, it explains their natural ability to turn people into larvae. Second, it leads to an interesting conclusion regarding the Hags' relationship with the 'loth, if indeed the Yugoloth origin of larvae is to be believed.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;joyblood&#039;</em> wrote:</div>
<div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>However, they realize that they are weak when compared to your average Baatezu or Tanar'ri or Yugoloth.</div></p>

<p>... that's where I don't agree. I do see members of the Hordling race as varied in power as the other fiendish races, and if I'm not mistaken, that was the common understanding over here (or else the idea of Hordling Lords would be quite absurd).<br />
</div></p>

<p>I meant the average hordeling to the average fiend of another race. I could very well be mistaken, but I never did figure just how tough the little buggers could get without jumping the shark and becoming Lords.</p></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>I sure don't mind discussing it <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/wink.png" title="Eye-wink" alt="Eye-wink" class="smiley-content"/> I'm not against making changes, only against making changes that break up old concepts too heavily.</p>

<p>As for the herds of larvae, I also don't know too many *official* products, but I've read a couple of things where it was used in fan-based articles over the years. While we CAN ignore that, of course, it's a bit like a slap in the face to those writers, and so I'm all for trying to find a better way to "get things straight".</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;Iavas&#039;</em> wrote:</div>For myself, the natural appearance of the non-natural petitioner form of larvae was always something that needed to be reconciled.</div></p>

<p>Where do you get your natural / unnatural references from? I myself always considered the larvae as a natural appearance on the lower planes.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;Iavas&#039;</em> wrote:</div>Only in 3.5e do the Baatorian petitioners begin appearing as actual humanoids before transformation, and that was WotC's attempt at replacing the larvae. More on this later...</div></p>

<p>I'm really looking forward to reading more about that. Though interestingly I always had the impression of at least part of the petitioners appearing in humanoid (or other, based on their original shapes) form. I've read so many Planescape books &amp; articles, though, that I can't really tell anymore where exactly that impression came from.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;Iavas&#039;</em> wrote:</div>

<p>Not always <span style="font-style:italic">entirely</span> possible, ergo my suggestion. If we can make it work, though, sure.</div></p>

<p>Well, there's always some blank spots and contradictions, that's true. But I always try to handle those by leaving them blank or contradicting <span style="font-style:italic">on purpose</span>, giving no official canon information for this, only theories and ideas.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;Iavas&#039;</em> wrote:</div>Ah. And here we get down to my conflict about fiendish petitioners. It appears I have subconsciously accepted some fan-based canon (I'm guessing Shemmy's) as official.</div></p>

<p>Well, that theory HAS appeared in official books, e.g. Faces of Evil, but even there it was presented as a theory, always stating it was only the Yugoloth's way to explain things. It might be true, or it might not.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;Iavas&#039;</em> wrote:</div>I am pretty sure that it has been stated <span style="font-style:italic">somewhere</span> officially that the Yugoloths, when cleansed of Law/Chaos by the General of Gehenna, discarded all the metaphysical 'bathwater' into the surrounding petitioners.

It can be surmised, therefore, that the weakened petitioners became larvae, rather than the hordes of hordlings, nupperibos, and manes.</div></p>

<p>Once more, an idea I really like - but one that I'd use as theory so we don't step on anyone's toes. <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/smile.png" title="Smiling" alt="Smiling" class="smiley-content"/></p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;Iavas&#039;</em> wrote:</div>Also, the particular difference between 'Dis' petitioners and your average Nupperibo (or default LE petitioner) was adequately explained as the Dis petitioners having a final regret for their misdeeds before death. Perhaps this was only in 3.5e, I'm not sure, but it was very fitting nevertheless.</div></p>

<p>Never read about that one. But honestly, to me, that explanation is a bit too simple and leaves too little room for creativity. I'd prefer seeing this as one option, but not as the absolute truth - unless it's really states as 100%, unchangeable unbreakable canon, of course.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;Iavas&#039;</em> wrote:</div>What I was trying to reconcile was where the larvae, which can be turned into any of the fiendish races and their kitty cats, actually came from.</div></p>

<p>And maybe there we've got a major point of our problems <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/wink.png" title="Eye-wink" alt="Eye-wink" class="smiley-content"/> I love making theories about such things, but so do many other people. If we'd set the creation of larvae as being "this way and no other", any attempt at getting further ideas about their creation keeps people from making up new theories - or ignoring our published content. Personally, I don't want any of those two things.</p>

<p>As a rule of thumb, I try to keep away from providing "this way and no other"-explanations for major topics as canon.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;Iavas&#039;</em> wrote:</div>What about the rest? Why are they so common across all the three of the lowest planes?</div></p>

<p>In my version of the planes, because countless evil people on the prime died all the time, and there were more than enough of them evil enough to turn into larvae. <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/smile.png" title="Smiling" alt="Smiling" class="smiley-content"/></p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;Iavas&#039;</em> wrote:</div>Basically, it boils down to whether or not the Yugoloth involvement in larvae creation was in any way even hinted at in the official canon. Because if it was, no radical changes to my theory are required.</div></p>

<p>Using your stuff as a theory, I agree with you. I just would have a bit of a problem setting it up as canon, as I explained.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;Iavas&#039;</em> wrote:</div>Note: while transcribing this, I noticed I've been spelling 'hordlings' with an 'e' this entire time and nobody told me. I feel stupid.</div></p>

<p>*lol* I noticed that, but honestly I liked it, and saw it as something like a "personal slang" <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/wink.png" title="Eye-wink" alt="Eye-wink" class="smiley-content"/></p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;Iavas&#039;</em> wrote:</div>It's <span style="font-weight:bold">thought</span> that hordlings <span style="font-weight:bold">might</span> actually be petitioners, their forms warped and twisted beyond recognition by the evil of the plane and their own twisted sense of self. <span style="font-weight:bold">Perhaps</span> they refused to let the plane break them or to let go of their hatreds and their angers.

(Planes of Chaos - Liber Malevolantiae, pp49-50)</div></p>

<p>See how even the official sources set these things up as "theories", as "might be" and "it's thought of"-information? I think it's important to look in detail at what's really presented as canon, and what as a theory. Theories are great building grounds for more creative work, and we shouldn't kill any of them by making them canon.</p>

<p>What just came to my mind is, maybe you never considered your ideas as suggestions for canon, but only as inspirational theories. If so, that would instantly kill most problems that I saw before. <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/wink.png" title="Eye-wink" alt="Eye-wink" class="smiley-content"/><br />
It's just that we're in a "canon defining" thread, so unless stated otherwise, I consider most of what's written here as suggestions for canon.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;Iavas&#039;</em> wrote:</div>There is also, further down, an interesting passage that suggests that Night Hags are really evolved larvae (I believe this was later expanded upon in Dragon Magazine as having to use a larvae during 'reproduction', although don't quote me on that), which does two things.

<p>Now THAT gives interesting possibilities, especially considering one of my Tiny Little Secrets (tm) that I'm going to spill soon.</p>

<p>Well, that's just me, but as I said, I always considered Hordlings - all of them - to be just as tough as any of the other fiends. It's just that they don't have any ranks or other hints at their power, so meeting a Hordling you don't say right away, "Oh powers! It's Slagchthziykrmgrmpf the Hordling!" like you would say, "Oh powers! It's a balor!" <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/smile.png" title="Smiling" alt="Smiling" class="smiley-content"/></p></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

          IMPORTANT DISCUSSION: What drives the Hordlings?        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;joyblood&#039;</em> wrote:</div>Where do you get your natural / unnatural references from? I myself always considered the larvae as a natural appearance on the lower planes.</div></p>

<p>I don't really remember, but somewhere. It could be canon, fan material, or my own internal logic trying to sort it all out.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;joyblood&#039;</em> wrote:</div>Though interestingly I always had the impression of at least part of the petitioners appearing in humanoid (or other, based on their original shapes) form. I've read so many Planescape books &amp; articles, though, that I can't really tell anymore where exactly that impression came from.</div></p>

<p>Again, could be. I always had the exact opposite impression, with humanoid petitioners only appearing in deific realms, Dis, and any gate-towns that might have slipped in. I have the exact same problem, I have a bunch of Planescape information rattling around inside the old brainbox and absolutely no idea where it all came from nor how valid it is. That's why I'm always amazed at ripvanwormer's encyclopedically referenced knowledge.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;joyblood&#039;</em> wrote:</div>Well, there's always some blank spots and contradictions, that's true. But I always try to handle those by leaving them blank or contradicting <span style="font-style:italic">on purpose</span>, giving no official canon information for this, only theories and ideas.</div>
<div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;joyblood&#039;</em> wrote:</div>Well, that theory HAS appeared in official books, e.g. Faces of Evil, but even there it was presented as a theory, always stating it was only the Yugoloth's way to explain things. It might be true, or it might not.</div>
<div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;joyblood&#039;</em> wrote:</div>Once more, an idea I really like - but one that I'd use as theory so we don't step on anyone's toes. <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/smile.png" title="Smiling" alt="Smiling" class="smiley-content"/></div>
<div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;joyblood&#039;</em> wrote:</div>I'd prefer seeing this as one option, but not as the absolute truth - unless it's really states as 100%, unchangeable unbreakable canon, of course.</div>
<div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;joyblood&#039;</em> wrote:</div>I love making theories about such things, but so do many other people. If we'd set the creation of larvae as being "this way and no other", any attempt at getting further ideas about their creation keeps people from making up new theories - or ignoring our published content. Personally, I don't want any of those two things.</p>

<p>As a rule of thumb, I try to keep away from providing "this way and no other"-explanations for major topics as canon.</div><br />
<div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;joyblood&#039;</em> wrote:</div>I just would have a bit of a problem setting it up as canon, as I explained.</div><br />
<div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;joyblood&#039;</em> wrote:</div>See how even the official sources set these things up as "theories", as "might be" and "it's thought of"-information? I think it's important to look in detail at what's really presented as canon, and what as a theory. Theories are great building grounds for more creative work, and we shouldn't kill any of them by making them canon.</p>

<p>What just came to my mind is, maybe you never considered your ideas as suggestions for canon, but only as inspirational theories. If so, that would instantly kill most problems that I saw before. <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/wink.png" title="Eye-wink" alt="Eye-wink" class="smiley-content"/><br />
It's just that we're in a "canon defining" thread, so unless stated otherwise, I consider most of what's written here as suggestions for canon.</div></p>

<p>And the last one nails it! See, I consider pretty much everything that directly says "this is the way it is" about the planes as theory, even if its in official material. Canon, for me, is just widely accepted theory. When I say 'canon', what I really mean is official 2e material. All the stuff that I've been suggesting is not meant to say "Alright, all of you that wrote fan material that disagreed with this were wrong." Neither I, you, nor anybody else on this board is in any position to do so. Only the original designers of Planescape can say that, and even then, it is possible that their own creation is living out a life of its own now. The only problem, of course, is starting to elaborate on 'just theories'. Having a bunch of contradicting theories is fine, but choosing one to elaborate on almost canonizes it in a way. That's just something we're going to have to deal with. That is precisely why I started this topic - to decide on some foundation for the way the lower planes, and the Waste in particular, function. There is no 2e canon to fall back that doesn't contradict itself at some point. Plus, a lot of fan material expands upon it quite well and, in my opinion, should be included in the fundamental theory of 'The Darkest Gray'. Believe me, the last thing I want to do is push my opinions down other people's throats. All that I was suggesting was merely that, suggestions - something to get the conversation going in that direction. I was not entirely aware that we were building a new 'canon' in this thread, so perhaps all of this should be moved to a different one. Nevertheless, what do you think should be the official (that is to say, for this particular ebook that you're building) fundamental workings of the Gray Waste. Or, am I simply looking too deep? I have a tendency to want to model the last blade of grass when world building.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Hi there!</p>

Neither I, you, nor anybody else on this board is in any position to do so.</div></p>

<p>That's not entirely right. Planewalker.com is the official Planescape fan site, and if I'm not mistaken, everything that we publish as "official Planewalker material" becomes "official Planescape material". At least I remember having read that back when Planewalker.com became the official site.</p>

<p>@Clueless: Please correct me if I'm wrong here!</p>

<p>This assumption is the reason for me being so careful with what we publish as project canon...</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;Iavas&#039;</em> wrote:</div>Having a bunch of contradicting theories is fine, but choosing one to elaborate on almost canonizes it in a way.</div></p>

<p>Not necessarily. See the "yugoloth created the other fiendish races" story for example. It appeared in official 2e books, but it was presented as "this could all be a lie from the 'loths" - and this way they gave DMs not only a great theory about the history of the planes, but even a couple of theories at once if you follow the questions that come up: What if the yugoloths lie? If they haven't created the other two races, who (or what) has? Are the yugoloths as distinct from baatezu and tanar'ri as they say, anyway? And so on and so on.</p>

<p>Maybe that makes clear the difference I see in presenting "theories" and "project canon".</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;Iavas&#039;</em> wrote:</div>That is precisely why I started this topic - to decide on some foundation for the way the lower planes, and the Waste in particular, function.</div></p>

<p>I'm not sure if that's beyond the point of this project. I understand you very well, but as our main focus stays Night Hags &amp; Hordlings, we should define only those things that we really need for our featured races.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;Iavas&#039;</em> wrote:</div>Nevertheless, what do you think should be the official (that is to say, for this particular ebook that you're building) fundamental workings of the Gray Waste.</div></p>

<p>That really depends on what we have as canon so far. I hope I'll be able to clear that up over the weekend. <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/smile.png" title="Smiling" alt="Smiling" class="smiley-content"/></p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;Iavas&#039;</em> wrote:</div>Or, am I simply looking too deep? I have a tendency to want to model the last blade of grass when world building.</div></p>

<p>I have that tendency, too, but IF what we do here is considered canon (and that's how I understood it), then any really basic change to how things work in Planescape that we do here basically influences the entire official D&amp;D multiverse (at least to those who use the Planescape multiverse)...</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Canon by popular opinion - so it's worthwhile being careful because it *will* affect the views and opinion of everyone playing the game (look at the influence of Shemmy's game alone)... unfortunately we have no formal pull or sway with WotC at this time, though I know there have been writers in the past (lots of the Piazo guys) who were paying attention.

          IMPORTANT DISCUSSION: What drives the Hordlings?        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Okay. Good, so we're on the same page. Both of us want as few changes to the original official canon as possible while still being able to include the better of the fan material and of our own ideas. </p>

<p>Whether or not what you are doing will be considered canon is really irrelevant, in a way. Either way, we want to do a good job in a way that conserves the internal consistency *coughunlikewizardsofthecoastcough*. So, as I see it, here is some stuff we need to find out or decide upon for this project if we are going to include some more background for the hordlings, hags, and the Waste in general (either as theory or as canon). My votes are in parentheses, but I reitirate that they are based on possibly invalid information and are simply my own preferences and suggestions, although I am trying not to contradict anything official that I can remember off the top of my head:</p>

<p>¤ Do hordlings arise from larvae, directly from the strongest souls that go to the Waste, or from both? (directly)<br />
¤ What is the spectrum of Hit Dice the hordlings can have? (1-20+, but with the majority being around 5ish)<br />
¤ Given that each cardinal plane seems to have its own exemplar, are the original (and here is what I mean by natural) exemplars of the Waste hordlings, night hags, or yugoloths? (hordlings)</p>

<p>If we chose to cover the topic of larvae, which I think we should, these are also important questions to ask: </p>

<p>¤ Do larvae only arise on the Waste and are then transported to other infernal planes, or do they arise on multiple planes? (Waste and then traded)<br />
¤ Are larvae natural petitioners, or somehow influenced by the machinations of yugoloths or baernaloths or night hags? (influenced, but I haven't decided how)<br />
¤ Just how much are larvae tied to night hags? (quite a bit)<br />
¤ Are larvae in any way related to yugoloths? If they are, what is the relationship between night hag - larvae - yugoloth? (still thinking on this one)</p>

<p>PS: If you want me to move this to a seperate thread, tell me.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I'm not sure how it may tie in, but as far as larvae go, I'm pretty sure the PS2e adventure "In the Abyss" has the Tanar'ri and the Doomguard constructing the massive Ships of Chaos out of Abyss-spawned Larvae. I could be wrong though, as I don't have the booklet with me. I do know the thing was primarily a writhing mass of fused souls built around a few demons, and most of the framework was shaped larvae.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

Also, the particular difference between 'Dis' petitioners and your average Nupperibo (or default LE petitioner) was adequately explained as the Dis petitioners having a final regret for their misdeeds before death.

<p>Never read about that one. But honestly, to me, that explanation is a bit too simple and leaves too little room for creativity. I'd prefer seeing this as one option, but not as the absolute truth - unless it's really states as 100%, unchangeable unbreakable canon, of course. </div></p>

<p>The only place that I know that mentions this is Fiend Codex II, and it is presented as 100% cannon (most things in that book are).  The Fiend Codex explanation is that they experienced true regret just <span style="font-style:italic">after</span> they died.

          IMPORTANT DISCUSSION: What drives the Hordlings?        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>By the way--there might be some interesting conjecture and darks to be had over the idea that a lot of Aberrations actually came from the Gray Wastes, spawned as a result of hordling unions between other hordlings or even mortals.</p>

<p>Some say that the whole illithid time-travel thing's just a big smokescreen, and the illithid--along with the aboleth, and a few other horrible aberrations--all got their start on the Gray Wastes...</p>

<p>To help support this dark, the Wastes might have a rather unusually high aberration population (and/or aberrations might have an automatic immunity to the Fade).</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Some how I think that larvae should appear on Baator the Abyss and The waste. After all the Abyss is supposed to have far more demons than Baator has devils. The only reason they can't use this to win the blood war is because they're too busy fighting amongst themselves. So then if larvae are only found on the waste how did the tanar'ri manage to get so many larvae to change into them. They're better traders than the devils perhaps? Not bloody likely. They institute a breeding program? Maybe but still not likely.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I keep wondering what relationship exists (if any) between the hordlings and the artifact known as the Bringer of Doom.  Who created it?  Why?  Why is it linked specifically to hordlings, and very large numbers of them at that?</p>

<p>Perhaps its creator saw hordlings merely as an expendable tool, but is the artifact connected to their nature and history in a more significant way?</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Although my knowledge of Planescape canon is woefully abysmal, I was thinking that the Yugoloth basically did not care about the Hordlings, because the Hordlings didn't try to do anything beyond the Gray Wastes.</p>

<p>At some point the Yugoloth may have been driven away by the Gray Wastes, and they may have plans sometime in the future to eventually conquer/manipulate/do stuff to it, but in general the rest of the Planes is content to leave the Waste and the Hordling alone. They don't have a unified agenda or any strong motivation to do anything beyond the Waste (a few do, but they're all working as individuals, not a collective).</p>

<p>There may be some one-on-one interaction between Yugoloths and Hordlings, or a Yugoloth running experiments on large groups to try and use the Hordlings for their own ends--but in general they probably just play it safe and don't bother the Hordlings (who probably tend to be just xenophobic enough as a fiendish race to kill any other fiends they encounter--this may be one of the few times that the Hordling actually work together as a species).</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>That's probably the case. In 2e, disease was one of the few things that no form of hordling was immune to (as presented in MC1), so that would be an effective way to deal with them. (Admittedly, I'm not sure if any 3e version gives them this form of immunity, as I haven't checked).</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;Kay&#039;</em> wrote:</div>For the 'loth? Because of their diversity? No offence, but that seems a bit far fetched.</div></p>

<p>The diversity works as an insulation against one single tactic. You can't deceive them all--they're too individualistic to believe in one lie. You can't pay them all off--too many of them have prices that are too high, or no price at all. You can't infect them all--because there are plenty that are immune to disease, or have a form that defies standardized infection.</p>

<p>The only really viable way to get rid of Hordlings is old-fashion 'roll-up-your-sleeves-and-kick-some-ass', and the Hordlings have a nasty habit of being very good at repelling that sort of tactic--especially on their home plane.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Their diversity and proliferation would explain why diseases don't wipe them out entirely, however I still think it would be a handy tactic for wiping out large numbers of Hordlings. Besides even if a disease was able to wipe them all out on the first layer they'd still work their way up from the other layers, or failing that new ones would be spontaneously created from Larvae</p>

<p>This would also help explain why the control of disease is so important to the Loths of the first layer of the wastes.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>In reference to the artifact known as the bringer of doom. As my sources indicate it was created during a loooong forgotten age when an uncertain people of an uncertain world, no one knows why they come all we know is they travel, they land, and then they conquer... Oops I got distracted. Um they are from an uncertain land and created by uncertain people in an age in which they were at a pinnacle of magical and technological prowess. They got greedy and, ultimately obliterated their entire civilisation leaving not one scrap of evidence to suggest that it ever existed besides one, that being the bringer of doom.</p>

<p>How or why they created it is probably up for speculation, however as to its origins, in my scourings of the net, it may very well have been originally from Oerth. But then again maybe it just has a habit of showing up on Oerth. Still...</p> <div class="dice_rolls">
