        <div class="dice_rolls">
</div> <p>Brought here to keep it from horribly derailing someone else's thread.  :^)</p>

<p>A point tangential to a question made in another thread was that some of the 2e Planescape material -- Guide to the Nine Hells, IIRC -- explicitly said atheists (again, explicitly mentioning Athar) end up in the bottommost layer of Baator, there to be devoured by Asmodeus.  The Forgotten Realms campaign setting apparently suggests that those who worshiped no god also get trapped in the plane of judgment and eventually face oblivion, though I'm quoting secondhand on that.</p>

<p>Personally, I refuse to countenance any rule that automatically sends somebody to Hell (or oblivion) regardless of alignment.  This thread, then, is for talking about where you'd think devoted atheists go.  They don't only have to be Athar -- some could be from Prime worlds where the gods are are very weak, manifesting rarely.  It could also be a concern in Urban Planescape.  It's been a while since I read about Athas, but don't the clerics worship the elements there?  Are there afterlife realms on the Inner Planes where fellowships of Athasian believers' spirits congregate after death, to spend time in fellowship meditating upon the nature of reality?</p>

<p>For one example, it would amuse me if the power of the Athars' beliefs had erected for them an afterlife on the Astral -- a mobile community of spirits searching the Astral eternally for the Great Unknown, with the spirits occasionally becoming one with the act of the searching itself (and perhaps finding the Great Unknown in the process).</p>

<p>Perhaps, like any other believer in Planescape that's not sincerely tied to a specific god, they simply end up in a realm which matches their alignment.  However, because they do more than simply not care about gods, but have a positive attachment to atheism that is of the flavor of a given alignment, they tend to end up in areas very far from powers' realms.</p>

<p>Thus, maybe the lawful evil atheists <span style="font-style:italic">do</span> get nabbed by Asmodeus, instead of ending up as spirits that might get noticed by lesser LE gods.  On the other hand, you could have lawful good atheists, who followed a code of morals because they believed it right without requiring the imprimatur of a deity, go directly to Chronias, out of reach of powers known to mortal ken!  Maybe chaotic good atheists find contentment in the sands of Pelion, and chaotic evil atheists have their own, personal layer of the Abyss to welcome them.  </p>

<p>Stephen Hawking, asked if he believed in God, replied, "Yes... if by God you mean the laws of the Universe."  Plenty of atheists might give the same response -- and be counted LN, finding beauty in truth and believing it important that we accept what <span style="font-style:italic">is</span>, without wishful thinking.  To become part of the machinery of the Universe they had studied for so long might appeal to some academes.  The same would apply to those atheists who, like Xaositects, who postively affirm a lack of divine plan in existence, and take comfort in this: they consider it important to take each moment of this life as it comes, and then end up in Limbo (where everywhere is as far away from anywhere else as anywhere else).</p>

<p>The utter nihilists, more maltheists than atheists, who truly believe the Universe has cursed them with death and curse it back, wreaking destruction just to throw a temper tantrum on the way to oblivion, or who despair before the emptiness of it all, find themselves not before Asmodeus, but instead embedded in the monoliths of the Grey Waste.  Those who simply focused on living their own lives following their day-to-day interests, true neutrals, wind up in the Hinterlands of the Outlands, and those who truly tried to help others, trying to bring about a better multiverse without any expectation of reward in an afterlife, find themselves shining quietly in the firmament of Elysium over Thalassa.</p>

<p>And finally, there are those atheists who reject gods, good, evil, law, chaos, and everything <span style="font-style:italic">normal</span> in inexplicable and affirmative rejection of, very nearly, existence itself.  If one hewed to the very politest, least offensive interpretation of "atheist," it might have been these souls damned to oblivion in 2e... but we've got a <span style="font-style:italic">much</span> better place for those souls in 3e.  A far, far realm indeed...</p>       </div>

         <p>Quite so. Strong belief in a particular outcome would likely influence their fate. But in my view it would take great faith to prevent the common belief in the planes from sending them to the home of their alignment. I once suggested Her Serenity might take their souls to populate backup gate-towns in case one slides away, but I don't think that quite fits the current system.</p>

<p>By the way, we could easily view the Athar as monotheists in a pagan world.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>The utter nihilists, more maltheists than atheists, who truly believe the Universe has cursed them with death and curse it back, wreaking destruction just to throw a temper tantrum on the way to oblivion, or who despair before the emptiness of it all, find themselves not before Asmodeus, but instead embedded in the monoliths of the Grey Waste.</div></p>

<p>The first part sounds like my description of the people who would welcome rebirth as a manes in the Abyss. The second certainly makes more sense than the Dark Lord claim.The bit about Asmodeus doesn't seem to fit the rules at all (besides sounding offensive). I don't know if the lawful bastard would even do that. It sounds like a distorted account of the simple fact that atheists would more often sign away souls they don't believe in. In order for the 2e version to make sense, you would have to place the LE ruler in opposition to all Powers, so that Moradin and Demogorgon (or Cyric, or the Power of Ragnarok) would be on the same side, united against him. Which makes no sense unless you follow my suggestion for the Athar and assume that monotheism is inherently <span style="font-size:9px">(lawful)</span> evil, something I'm not willing to do.</p>

<p>People who want to preserve the claim as best they can might take it to mean that Law's evil serpent benefits when people adhere to any abstract principle of law that counts as evil. He gets the souls and 'worship' of people like Stalin or the Imaskari in stories because they have no LE Powers to compete with him. This takes the focus off atheism and puts it back on Asmodeus' portfolio where it belongs.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>I'll expand on my opinion that I shared in the hijacked thread.</p>

<p>First, to explain Asmodeus' seemingly inproportionate power. In <span style="text-decoration:underline">Guide to Hell</span>, Asmodeus, previously known as Ahriman, was one of the two co-founders of the multiverse, along with the being that now hides itself in the guise of the deity of couatls, Jazirian. This would, indeed, explain why Asmodeus has the power to take all the souls of non-believers, but it is inconsistent with a lot of other information and I am not too fond of the theory. Also, while the book mentions him taking the souls of the Athar, I do not see the Athar as unbelievers.</p>

<p>Here is how I personally reconcile everything. Souls of clergymen (clerics, paladins, and others that directly serve a deity) go to their deity's realm as long as they kept that deity's favour throughout their lives. People that are truly faithful to their deity, even if they were not direct servitors thereof, also go to that diety's realm. People that were only nominal followers of a deity go to the plane that matches their alignment, as do those that served a particular belief rather than a diety (this includes the Athar). This also makes sense, since when enough souls that believe a certain idea gather in a certain area of a single plane, they can create enough belief to form a new deity of that idea. Only those people that did not believe in anything but lived from day to day without striving for anything or seeking the truth would somehow be punished. How? Well, just like everything else, it is up to the DM. Personally, I haven't really decided. Although I called them 'atheists' in my previous post on the subject, I am also beginning to dislike the term. I just can't think of a better single word to describe them? Apathetics seems good, but I'm open to suggestions. </p>

<p>Also, though this may be a bit off topic, here is how I personally see the hellish hierarchy. (EDIT: That picture didn't work, so I'll just explain). Baernaloths are the most powerful and ancient of the known fiends. They might have been equals of the Ancient Baatorians and Obyriths or even older and more powerful (in which case the NE of the same generation as Obyriths/Baatorians were the Night Hags, which are not as powerful physically but more likely to gain character classes). For whatever reason, probably to (re)gain control over the entirety of Evil, they created their children, the Yugoloths and then either created or helped the 'loths create the Baatezu and Tanar'ri to replace the Ancient Baatorians and Obyriths, respectively. The Yugoloths, under the careful guidance of the Baern, covertly keep the Baatezu and Tanar'ri under control by engaging them in the Blood War (which was impossible to do with their predecessors). The surviving Obyriths (and any Ancient Baatorians that might be in hiding) are so decimated that they stand no chance against their usurpers, much less the Baern. Asmodeus is enigmatic as ever. He might be the Baern in charge of the Baatezu or an Ancient Baatorian that helped the Baatezu take over, gaining his rule from the Baern in payment. Whether the Obyrith rulers, such as Pale Night, have given up or only made it seem that way is unknown. The Grey Wastes have been shattered sometime int he past, no doubt because of this ancient conflict that made the Blood War seem like a tea party, and put back together using the black obelisks as staples, the greatest of which is in the center of Center. This all happened before the oldest of the currently known sentient Prime races (even elves), so only the oldest of the currently surviving deities even have a chance of knowing the truth. The Upper Planes no doubt had their hand in this conflict, but whether they were the enemy that the Baern were doing all this to defeat or a devil's advocate to prevent the conflict from spreading beyond the lower planes is also unknown.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Jem ,I agree with most of that, but I really don't see anything special or different happening to atheists than to anyone else (excluding clerics and the similarly devoted); they just go to the plane that matches their alignment.</p>

<p>I believe that the complete and utter rejection of law, chaos, good, and evil, would require contact with the Far Realm.  But ultimately despite the amorality of the Far Realm and any individual's beliefs, all actions within the multiverse (and I consider the Far Realm to be outside of the multiverse) do have moral ramifications.  I might utterly reject alignment and ordinary existence; but if I killed a man in cold blood to demonstrate the meaninglessness and  transience of this existence, that action is still evil within the multiverse that I exist.  So they too would go to an Outer Plane corresponding to their alignment.</p>

<p>All souls naturally travel to the Outer Planes upon death.  The only ones that don't end up there are those who get lost in the Astral Plane (for whatever reason), who due to some great emotional trauma or unfinished business refuse to leave the material plane and wind up as ghosts in the ethereal plane, and the most pious priests of gods who dwell elsewhere (such as the Inner Planes) who are snatched up by their deity on the way to the Outer Planes and brought to the realm of their god.</p>

<p>Iavas, people who do not strive for anything and just live day to day should still end up in the Outer Plane corresponding to their alignment.  People who do <span style="font-style:italic">nothing</span> (like the severely mentally handicapped) likely end up with their souls drifting in the Astral Plane.</p>

<p>I would advise you to check out <a href="http://www.dicefreaks.com/phpBB2/" class="bb-url">http://www.dicefreaks.com/phpBB2/</a> for some interesting ideas about the origin of the multiverse (their downloadable e-book "The Gates of Hell" matches just about anything written for the Planewalker setting).</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>It seems inconsistent with itself, as well. I skipped a step in my thinking earlier when I said "don't know if the lawful bastard would even do that." The story logically implies that Asmodeus and Jazirian helped to shape the known rules of the afterlife, with its Outer Planes for petitioners of various alignments. I see no reason they would have agreed to give Ahriman the souls of unbelievers. It doesn't follow from the general rules they decided on. We haven't heard of any concession that Jazirian got in return. Ahriman can already get souls through contracts (presumably anyone can do this.) So why would Mr. Lawful Evil himself break the rules he agreed to in the beginning? Especially since, if the Prime Material goes on forever, it must supply infinitely many devotees of abstract evil law every week?</p>

<p>I'd expect to see these souls looking confused in the Outlands and often laboring in the service of faction members or other people of strong belief. Most people would just call them weaklings, or 'you there!'</p>

<p>I pretty much agree on the fiendish rulers. At some point I'll have to post my thoughts on the night hags as true natives of the Waste and the yugoloths as aliens of a sort.</p>

<p>You may have heard rumors or speculation about an ancient humanoid civilization that vanished before the appearance of fiends in their modern forms. I think the ones we know as Baernaloths took on the forms of somebody's nightmares in order to help destroy that civilization. Afterwards they found they could no longer breed normally, much less reshape all existence as they'd orginally planned. They might not even remember what they planned, or what they once were. (Certainly no one else does.) But they found a new identity and a way to make children of a sort by joining with a newly forming plane. It probably went both ways -- I don't know if their obelisks put the Waste back together so much as shaped it into a form more to their Demented taste.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>The idea of the souls of Athar joining in endless migration across the Astral is pretty damn cool.</p>

<p>However, I'd say most nonbelievers simply go to their plane of alignment (or whichever fits their personality best).</p>

<p>As for Asmodeus, of course he doesn't get nonbelievers automatically. He craves nonbelievers because the substance of doubt wears away at his bonds - with enough of them, he'll be able to rewrite the laws encoded into his plane long before he came to rule it. With enough doubt, he can reforge the Outer Planes in his image. So he collects the souls of doubters (which isn't exactly the same as atheists, since some, though certainly not most, atheists treat their beliefs as a matter of faith, rather than as a matter of doubt). He decrees that the souls of the doubtful be brought to Nessus and dropped in the deepest of pits, whose sides are continually worn away by the dubious sinners, their larval forms eating away at the substance of the planes of belief. Desiring more, he trades with shadow fiends and night hags - the larva he's collecting from the night hags is known in planar circles, which is why the larva entry in the PSMC1 speaks of the Bringing, an apocalyptic event that, burning the power of countless thousands of larvae at once, rumored to be capable of changing the direction of the Blood War once and for all.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Both plausible, but I personally go the other way. As I said, most people without direct and total subservience to their deity end up in an outer plane that matches their alignment. This includes Average Joe Farmer and Slinky Sam Rogue. It also inclues people who are not sure that there is a higher purpose but think about it. Basically, it includes anybody with even a shred of belief in one thing or another. Only the totally apathetic worthless refuse of the planes, the people that have no belief in anything whatsoever and simply go with the flow because it doesn't require thinking, are cursed, so to speak. The planes are founded on belief, and if you don't have any you won't get a piece of the planes. Whether such people end up feeding some hellish machine or creature that has learned to attract these lost souls or simply winked out of existence is, for me, still uncertain. I'm sort of against them wandering the Astral (as nobody should be there in the first place) or going to the Far Realm (because the multiverse is supposed to be self-contained).</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

          Atheists on the Planes        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>As I said on the other plane, and as I'm sure most here already agree, atheists do have beliefs. Besides believing that the gods don't exist, aren't divine, or (in the case of many Buddhists) are divine but are irrelevant to salvation, the vast majority of people, atheist theist and agnostic alike, have morals and ethics and believe that they are right. As far as I am concerned, alignment is a direct measure (in very simplified game terms) of a person's ethical and moral beliefs and behavior. So there is no reason I can see that anybody would not end up, at least, on the plane of their alignment unless the person was not only totally sociopathic and apathetic, but also so extremely nihilistic that they somehow rejected even complete neutrality. I'm not sure this is even possible for human psychology apart from people who are genuine vegetables. I could imagine those folks floating through the astral, peacefully, or something. But everyone else should end up with an afterlife unless the fiends actually did get a hold of their soul through contracts, or them becoming a larva, or whatever, and sold them to Asmodeus.</p>

<p>I think the statement in whatever book that atheists are automatically eaten by Asmodeus as "the true damned of the multiverse" is utterly horrible, stupid turd, and regardless of how canonical it is I think it should be ignored.</p>

<p>This is how I see it: Clerics and faithful worshippers of specific gods go to the god's realm. People who are only casual worshippers, or who worship an entire pantheon, or believe in an entire pantheon but don't worship any god more than the others, go to the pantheon's group realm or the afterlife soul-gathering place of that Pantheon: Kelemvor, Hades, Yamapura, etc. Then according to the pantheon's dictates, some of these stay in that initial place, some are sent elsewhere, such as a person in Hades getting sent to Elysium or Arborea or Carceri, and some are reincarnated or, if the pantheon actually calls for it, obliterated.</p>

<p>People who don't believe strongly in a particular pantheon, who are Athar or atheists or agnostics or Buddhists, who aren't really sure what to believe in, or who worship abstract concepts and ideas, go to the realm of their alignment. Even most of the super-nihilistic, apathetic people will usually end up in an outer plane, even if it is the Grey Waste. Only those who truly lack morals or ethics of any kind could end up obliterated automatically, but even then I'd argue that somebody utterly amoral is just NE. Hades is the plane of apathy, as well.</p>

<p>But for those who disagree with landing on the plane of alignment, what do you think happens in Planescape to "clueless" who worship a god that <span style="font-style:italic">doesn't actually exist</span>? Or worship a god that, unknown to them, is dead? What if they worship something that does exist but isn't actually a god, or which has no plane and no realm and accepts no petitioners? I mean, say that there's a small cult of people on the prime somewhere who believe their planet is an Earth Goddess and worship her. Except in reality, their planet is just a hunk of completely inanimate rock. What happens?</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Just about everyone has beliefs. But there's a difference between believing in something and not believing in something. The former, as far as the Outer Planes are concerned, is <span style="font-style:italic">creative</span> - you're reinforcing something with your belief. The second is destructive - you're only taking away from the substance of the Outer Planes.</p>

<p>I think there's a real, useful distinction between a disagreement about whether an object is a hammer or a screwdriver and a disagreement about whether the object is there at all. If something doesn't exist, or doesn't possess a quality (such as divinity or worthiness), there's really nothing to talk about. There's nothing to believe. We aren't required to believe things about objects, qualities, or beings who don't exist. </p>

<p>Part of the problem here is linguistic. It's certainly grammatically correct to say "I believe this doesn't exist," but I think the English language, and the flexible meaning of the word "belief," fails to capture a crucial distinction between different orders of belief. Saying that not believing in something is a kind of belief is like saying that not running is a kind of running, or not punching someone in the face is a kind of punching them in the face. Because belief is defined only by thought, and not something tangible like hitting people, it's easy to claim it exists even its absence, where with hitting people there'd be much less dispute.</p>

<p>I think not believing in something can <span style="font-style:italic">lead</span> to beliefs, which is where things get more confusing. If I chose to disbelieve in the chair that I'm sitting on, I'm probably forcing myself to accept a host of new beliefs - that  my legs are much longer than they really are, or I've somehow developed the ability to levitate, or someone is carrying me, that I'm hallucinating or dreaming, or that the object I'm sitting on is something other than a chair. If you don't believe the powers are divine, what <span style="font-style:italic">do</span> you believe about the powers? Maybe you're just not a very thoughtful person, so you don't believe much of anything about them. But many Athar will have complex theories about what exactly the powers are and how they came to be so powerful. They may also have theories about something that <span style="font-style:italic">is</span> divine, a Great Unknown that lies beyond what is comprehensible by mortal intellects.</p>

<p>It's also possible to disbelieve in something in such a way that you're doing more than simply not believing in that thing - maybe you're believing in its absence in the same way that others believe in its presence. This is the difference between a negative number and a zero. It's difficult to judge this difference in the case of things as amorphous as beliefs, which makes the whole discussion more complicated than I wish it was.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div> So there is no reason I can see that anybody would not end up, at least, on the plane of their alignment unless the person was not only totally sociopathic and apathetic, but also so extremely nihilistic that they somehow rejected even complete neutrality.</div></p>

<p>That depends. You can <span style="font-style:italic">have</span> an alignment without being <span style="font-style:italic">defined</span> by it. Maybe you're lawful good, but your doubt is more important to you than your morals or ethics. Maybe your doubt is so powerful that it eats away at the substance of the planes, causing you to drift into the Astral, the plane where beliefs go when they die. The Astral is where gods go when the lack of belief in them becomes more powerful than the belief in them, and maybe it's the same with souls.</p>

<p>Maybe if you're doubtful enough, your doubt can even eat away at your own soul, leaving you with nothing to survive your body at all.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>People who are only casual worshippers, or who worship an entire pantheon, or believe in an entire pantheon but don't worship any god more than the others, go to the pantheon's group realm or the afterlife soul-gathering place of that Pantheon</div></p>

<p>I think that's for the pantheon to decide. For the Greeks, those not especially beloved by the gods go to the realm of Hades. For the Faerunians, anyone who has a divine patron goes to the realm of that divine patron, and those with no particular patron (or those who worship falsely or faithlessly) go to the realm of Kelemvor. The Norse have a more complex system where it depends on whether you die in battle, of drowning, or of other causes. For those who don't have faith in a particular pantheonic system, they go to the realm of their god or, if they have no particular god, their plane of alignment.</p>

<p>Planescape, at least, didn't distinguish between faithful worshipers and casual worshipers. They all go to the realm of their god, if they have one. However, that's not to say that it's impossible for petitioners to escape from a god's realm if they really want out. If their beliefs in the god are truly inconsequential and nominal, there's nothing in particular keeping them there, or even choosing not to go there in the first place (at least in theory).</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>But for those who disagree with landing on the plane of alignment, what do you think happens in Planescape to "clueless" who worship a god that <span style="font-style:italic">doesn't actually exist</span>? Or worship a god that, unknown to them, is dead?</div></p>

<p>If they believe in that god, the god will start to come into existence, or start to come back to life. One person's belief isn't enough to create or resurrect a god, but it'll still make an difference - there'll be a slight presence, a subtle stirring of the corpse, a rash of strange dreams. This is the core from which a god can form. This is why even in the most thoroughly murdered gods, some amount of power can still hum there. </p>

<p>At this level, there probably isn't enough power to draw souls to the proto-god (so yeah, they'll end up on their plane of alignment most likely). But as more and more people believe in something, the power grows, and souls will end up going there, even before they've made an actual god. In the example of people worshiping the dead earth, they may end up as ghosts or incorporeal spirits haunting the Material Plane until they're ready to give up on their beliefs. In the case of a dead god, faithful worshipers might even end up merging with the god's corpse, slowly giving it enough power to bring itself back to life. Or their spirits may merely haunt the Astral island.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Just about everyone has beliefs. But there's a difference between believing in something and not believing in something. The former, as far as the Outer Planes are concerned, is <span style="font-style:italic">creative</span> - you're reinforcing something with your belief. The second is destructive - you're only taking away from the substance of the Outer Planes.</div></p>

<p>Well, again, atheists can believe in their alignments. And Shemmy's fan theory (as I interpret it, anyway) has the alignment planes acting like giant lazy Powers, with planar rulers as a special kind of Proxy. Certainly the fiends must have <span style="font-style:italic">some</span> kind of protection from the infinitely many deities who must logically decide to sterilize Gehenna every week if we accept canon claims about the size of the Prime Material and other planes. Any time we want to use the words 'extremely unlikely' in this context, that means it happens infinitely many times. (Otherwise I doubt Asmodeus would find enough doubters in the Waste.) This doesn't necessarily contradict the rest of what you say.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>I don't think it contradicts any part of what I said. I agree that atheists can believe in their alignments, and I think they almost always end up on their plane of alignment when they die. I was speaking in hypotheticals - in theory, someone might have such a surfeit of doubt (this need not be about everything - being doubtful enough of only one thing might be sufficient) that they might not have a place in the Outer Planes at all, despite having an alignment and even believing in it.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

Since in Planescape the gods' existence is pretty self-evident,  I don't think any Athar claim they don't exist. They only claim that they aren't divine and aren't worthy to worship.
It is only on a prime world like Athas, where no pantheon comes to interact with mortals, that you would have people who think they don't exist.</p>

<p>But like I said, belief in an absence of something is still a belief. It is still a thought. Only total vegetables supposedly lack thought entirely.<br />
And if by belief you mean faith, then again, I point to every person who thinks their morals/alignment are "right." That is not religious faith, but it is the same sort of emotions and thoughts.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>A character grows up on a backwater prime, where the gods of good have established temples, and generally take an active, beneficient role in society, and the temples of evil are reduced to cults, skulking in the sewers and dark dungeons.  The character simply lacks the moral fortitude to follow a good god's path, but neither does he care to join some dark cult.  So instead, he bitterly rejects all the gods as too demanding, and spreads his cynicism to the faithful trying to find like minded souls.</p>

<p>That man is asmodeus food.</p>

<p>A character believes that the powers are aspects of a true divinity, foiled by concious belief and fooled senses.  The man devotes himself to a life of philosophy and contemplation, believing only from within can he know the true nature of divinity.</p>

<p>Sounds like Elysium, or maybe Celestia to me.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Right. The question is not whether or not the powers exist, but whether or not their divinity exists.</p>

<p>One side of the debate says the powers possess an intangible concept called "divinity" or "worthiness."</p>

<p>The Athar say the powers do not have these qualities. </p>

<p>The argument, then, is like an argument between a group of people who believe a hammer (or possibly a screwdriver) exists on a table and a group that says there is nothing there at all. Belief in something versus the lack of belief in that thing, rather than belief in something versus the belief in something else.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>But like I said, belief in an absence of something is still a belief. It is still a thought.</div></p>

<p>The lack of belief in something is not the same as belief in the thing's absence. One is passive, the other is active. There's a big difference between someone who disbelieves because of doubt and a person who disbelieves because of certainty.</p>

<p>I think it's important to take note of that difference when you're imagining universes made of belief. If the Outer Planes are made of belief, how would real doubt affect them? Not an alternate belief - the Outer Planes are all about that - but <span style="font-style:italic">doubt</span>. </p>

<p>Nobody's saying the Athar don't think, but the way in which they think can be crucial.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>And if by belief you mean faith, then again, I point to every person who thinks their morals/alignment are "right." That is not religious faith, but it is the same sort of emotions and thoughts.</div></p>

<p>The distinction I'm trying to make is one of priorities. How important are your morals to you? If someone has a different set of morals, do you refuse to associate with them? If that's true, you should probably go to your plane of alignment. If other qualities are more important to you - a shared faith in a deity, perhaps, or maybe interests and philosophies that have nothing to do with ethics - then a plane's alignment shouldn't be that great of a concern for your soul.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

Not an alternate belief - the Outer Planes are all about that - but <span style="font-style:italic">doubt</span>.</div></p>

<p>Well, painting all atheists with the same brush and sending them all to Hell makes no sense. I'm trying to point out that some atheists have a positive belief in something, not merely doubt. Belief in nothing. Belief in the completely logical, non-supernaturalness of the world. Belief that humans don't need gods. Whatever it is, atheism isn't <span style="font-style:italic">always</span> merely doubt or lack of commitment. That's agnosticism's department.</p>

<p>Anyway, like I said, even if that book was Planescape canon (and you've pointed out that it's not) I would ignore it's statement, because that statement is hateful.</p>

<p>The Outer Planes are made of belief. What's the Astral made of, thought? What exactly are Astral conduits? Perhaps they are like strands of thought, shaped and spun from the Astral by the soul that travels, forming them into strands of belief that resonates with the belief in the character's soul and reaches towards the place that belief resonates with -- the god's realm, the alignment plane, whatever. When an atheist believes strongly in an alignment, in human potential, in science, in nihilism, whatever, that belief should still work. But if they only hold doubt, if they have no beliefs at all, then their soul cannot spin enough threads or connect them to any plane and they will drift, peacefully, in the Astral. If there is both doubt and belief in their soul but the doubt is stronger, then as they travel through the Astral, toward their destination, the threads form a bond to the planes, tentatively, but the doubt eats the threads away until the personal conduit breaks and again, that person drifts in the Astral. That isn't necessarily a pleasant afterlife, but it's far better than assigning damnation to atheists regardless of alignment and behavior in life.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I thought it was generally agreed that atheists go to their plane of alignment and only the truly unthinking get punished in some way. And I really disagree with agnosticism being only doubt and uncommitment. I consider myself agnostic, and by that I mean that while I believe in many things, and ponder a great many more, I do not walk about saying that I know the will of the divine like most religions do. It is not doubt or uncommitment to admit that you do not have all the answers, as long as you keep looking for them.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>It looks like we've come to general consensus, then.  I'm glad to hear that "Guide to Hell" is noncanonical by PS standards, and we seem to be in agreement that automatically damning or disbanding anybody is right out.  Atheists in realms without significant godly presence, humanists, materialists, people who worship nonexistent or deceased deities, and the like have their various afterlives, often simply based on their alignment if they have no particularly active power to claim them.  Disbandment of souls seems to happen only in extreme cases where the soul's life was literally defined by an opposition to or doubt of all beliefs, even a belief in the importance of skepticism or the search for truth, or like those of the Dustmen or the Xaositects, who find some sort of truth in emptiness or lack of overall design.  Such a state might even be possible only for someone with certain mental problems that prevent them from forming a stable soul.</p>

Oh no, I didn't mean that at all. I mean that somebody who was doubtful about gods but didn't commit to fully disbelieving in them, sounds more like an agnostic position than a fully atheistic one to me.</p>

<p>I know that it's also common to commit to the belief that true knowledge about the divine is impossible. Sort of like in the alignment system, where some Neutrals lack commitment to any alignment and some are committed specifically to the Balance.</p>

<p>Besides, agnostics can believe strongly in an alignment, a moral code, an abstract principle, or nationality, just like other folkage.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

As far as the afterlife fate of atheists, they would go to their planes of alignment (i.e. a Neutral Good atheist would likely wind up on Elysium, notwitstanding the claims of those who would argue that he would go to the Lower Planes for his disbelief! This is one of the areas where Planescape is actually more realistic and correct than the real world: In Planescape, what matters is whether a person is Good-aligned, NOT what religious beliefs he did or didn't profess!!!

         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;Anime Fan&#039;</em> wrote:</div>The Athar are NOT atheists! </div></p>

<p>A lot of them are. Some, like Factol Terrence, believe there is some true divinity beyond the false powers, but it's not required for an Athar to believe this. You can be an Athar and believe that true divinity doesn't exist.</p>

<p>The Great Unknown isn't really a god, not exactly. It's just something that is worthy of being worshiped, something that's not petty or jealous or unjust or mortal or comprehensible. It's something that's eternal and perfect and for some reason impossible for mortals to perceive thus far except through the spells it grants. It might be more of a force, or an ideal, or perfection itself. It's something that mortals can never personify or understand.</p>

<p>The Athar believe the powers aren't truly divine because, as a class of beings, they are known to be unjust, petty, lustful, vengeful, capable of dying. Most Athar understand that an individual god may be an exception to these rules. Terrence has nothing but respect and admiration for his former patron, the goddess Mishakal, but because she's the same basic kind of entity as Hiddukel or Chemosh, he no longer sees her as a divinity. She's simply a good person who does the best she can with her great power; he's decided that this isn't enough to justify worshiping her.</p>

<p>Some Athar aren't that way. Some are angry at all the powers, believing them to be frauds and liars. Some don't believe there is any true divinity in the multiverse; why should they? What evidence has it given of itself? If there's a true god somewhere, why hasn't it filled the multiverse with justice and love? If a god exists, why is there suffering? They believe that Athars like Terrence live on false hope, and that the spells they receive are only the products of their own misguided dreams, if they're not actually given to them by fiends or false powers who find their delusions useful.</p>

<p>If all Athars believed in a god, they would be monotheists. And they're not. Many are atheists or agnostics. Terrence and other believers in the Great Unknown are probably theists of a sort, though not monotheists; they don't necessarily believe the Great Unknown is a singular being, or even an entity in the sense the term is normally meant. It is simply that which merits worship. It's the faith that somewhere out there, something is worthy of their devotion, even if the flawed beings in the imperfect planes they know are not.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>"Look at that, ain't it grand!" spoke the deep grumbling voice of Pertens. A muscular mountain of a man bearing the scars of battle and time like a badge of honor. He stood in the armor and regalia of the once Faction, the Athar as though they still resided at the shattered temple in Sigil rather than at the base of the Spire, in exile from those Powers they made enemies of.</p>

<p>"What, the spire?" came the meek voice of Job.  His youth betrayed him in his voice. Job had only recently joined the Athar before Duke Rowan Darkwood made his bid for power against the Lady of Pain, and lost. He was still new to all of the wonders of the planes and green to the dark of things. The retreat from Sigil and the changes it entailed still had him confused.</p>

<p>"Yes I mean the spire! Aren't they a grand thing!"</p>

<p>"What do you mean they?" Job asked meekly afraid that he was showing his inexperience to the dark that all of the defiers knew.</p>

<p>"They, the aethiests." Pertens said before turning to Job. "It is their souls that make it."</p>

<p>Job considered these words carefully before speaking, "Is this a test?"</p>

<p>"HRmm? No, why do you ask?"</p>

<p>"We''," Job began, "I was always told that the spire represented the total belief of all those living in the planes."</p>

<p>"Bah" Pertens said with a dismissive wave of his hand, "Forgewash, rubbish! If you really think about it, it does not make any sense," Job looked at Pertens quizzically and this cued him to continue. "See, aethiests do not accept the Powers. Hells, most of them do not accept magic as not more than sleights of hand of ghost as more than spook stories. Since they so adamantly stick to the belief that there is no higher powers, their stone cold belief and spirits send them here to the Spire. It is here that they merge with the stone and give it its power. All of that belief that there is no Powers, Magic, or other unwholesome phenomena radiates out from here. Why do you think magic, undead, psionics, and the like diminish the closer you get to here or, for that matter, why the Powers are powerless here."</p>

<p>"But, all those other things; magic, ghosts, psionics, and the like. They are real," Job spoke in an almost protest to the argument.</p>

<p>"You really are a green berk." Pertens said disdainfully. Job looked down and Pertens immediatelty regretted his choice of words. Picking the youth's chin up to look at him, he said in a tone of a father lecturing his son, "That may be but, they did not believe that and THAT is why this place is special. Even though there is no magic, conduits, or Powers this is still the Outlands and, even here, belief is all that matters."</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Just my own opinion, but what about the atheist who are so ardent in their beliefs that they scoff at and deride the truely religious?  Hammer at their beliefs, smash them with fossils, and truely hate the religious with an almost-religious furor.  Most folks who have had to sit through some psuedo-intellectual after he read Atlas Shrugged know the type I mean.  Not like Hawking or Einstein, but like the statement Marx made about those that need religion feels about the religious.</p>

<p>Well, again, in my own opinion, in the realm of the gods, this is something that is an absolute no-no.  These folks are pulling at the powers' main source of power and well-being, and I can see some sort of cabal in the ancient days where the powers all agreed to send these folks to Asmodeus.  Asmodeus certainly believes in the powers, and torment and anihilation at his hands could be the judgement that some powers have decided as right and just for turning against them.</p>

<p>Again, this is just my attempt to get it in line with printed material.  Maybe the gods don't WANT those atheists messing up their realms and spouting screed (according to the gods) that can turn the religious among us "off" to  their religion...so they respond the only way they see fit:  Give 'em time on the prime/planes to learn the "truth," and if they can't get that into their heads, the afterlife is all torture and pain as a "reward" for their views.  The gods don't like you messing with their food, after all!</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>First off, I'll reiterate that this is just my attempt to align with printed material.   Asmodeus wouldn't necessarily increase in power or anything with all those atheist souls running around in the Ninth Level, they wouldn't worship him, they would just be his food and playthings as a precursor to true death of those souls.  Remember, this is the punishment laid down in ancient days for those who forsake the gods in all ways, not necessarily how I would run things. </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;Jem&#039;</em> wrote:</div>Let those who do evil in the name of atheism go to the Lower Planes, and let those who do good in the name of atheism go to the Upper Planes, like the rest of them.</div> 
Again, to the gods, who create and sustain life, there isn't a difference between the two.  Forsaking them is forsaking their system of reward, and the only difference between a good atheist and a bad atheist is that one was nicer to be around during his time on the Prime.  Once he died, again, because he forsook the gods in all things and denied them, he reaps the punishment meted out by even the most benevolent of Powers...he goes to  Asmodeus on his way to true death (or who knows, maybe reincarnation: The printed material wasn't exactly clear on what the big A actually does with the souls in the first place). </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Again, this is just my attempt to get it in line with printed material.

Oh, yeah...that's one thing we have in common for sure.  I don't have to like it, but then again, if I was born in a Norse world what right do I have to denounce Odin and his crew?  All the good living in the world may not appease His Eyelessness if I simply gave up on believing in him in the first place.  Nobody (except the Athar) says the gods aren't perfect, and the price of denial of that perfection may be eternal damnation.  The Athar could probably use these arguments to show how <span style="font-style:italic">un</span>perfect the powers actually are...spiteful and corrupt even in their most goodly incarnations.  Makes for great recruiting, anyways <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/smile.png" title="Smiling" alt="Smiling" class="smiley-content"/>.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>The gods don't have that level of power over souls that don't worship them. Souls are, by and large, free to choose their own fates. </p>

<p>And it's bad for the game to single out a major PC faction as getting an afterlife inferior to everyone else's. And <span style="font-style:italic">Guide to Hell</span> does explicitly damn all the Athar, not just the atheistic ones, claiming the entire faction is just Asmodeus' plot. </p>

<p>Seeking to harmonize official sources at the expense of common sense and fairness to the players (as opposed to the characters) is misguided. That said, there are ways to account for <span style="font-style:italic">Guide to Hell</span>'s ideas without automatically damning every atheist and Athar in the campaign. Have Asmodeus purchase the souls in the form of larvae (Planes of Law and the PSMC1 both mention the baatezu doing this in vast numbers, in preparation for something called "the Bringing"). This allows him to have the same basic scheme and doesn't require you to warp the cosmology in a patently grotesque way. Perhaps the souls of doubters really do help weaken his bonds; this would make it useful for the Dark Lord of Nessus to encourage atheism without all atheists automatically becoming his pawns.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I've wondered about your question myself, and I am one.  :^)</p>

<p>If I myself were, in possession of memories of the fictional Planescape, exposed to the apparent existence of a parallel multiverse that apparently aligned in substantial observable respects with that fiction, I would probably become roughly Deist -- a Creator probably set the whole thing in motion but does not presently seem to act independently in the world, and is certainly not one of the gods much known in the Planescape region.</p>

<p>This isn't too far off from the Athar, in fact.</p>

<p>One thing would be a considerable relief to start with: in Planescape, souls obviously exist and are subject to a certain cosmic justice in their final disposition.  Of course, given how unreasonable the entire setup would be, there would be a strong suspicion that I was being elaborately defrauded by high-tech means, a supposition no less unlikely than the existence of magic, miracles, and multiple worlds.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>A genuine atheist on Earth, transplanted to Planescape?</p>

<p>In the Planescape setting, it's not hard to get pretty tangible proof of the existence of various deities (and various afterlives).  Also proof of the supernatural in general.  Some of them might actually find a deity that works well for them and go with that.  </p>

<p>Others would say:  Deities clearly exist here, but I'm not sure I want to actually <span style="font-style:italic">worship</span> any of these guys.  I'm not sure whether they would necessarily join the Athar, since Athar are portrayed as outright <span style="font-style:italic">hostile</span> to deities.</p>

<p>A couple might even say:  "The gods here are born and die; why, a mortal can even become a god.  If I can convert enough people to my cause, I could become a deity."  The ones who would do this are probably either very power-hungry or have a unique personal belief system that doesn't fit in with the existing bunch of deities.  Anyway, they might join the Godsmen.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>It would seem ridiculously hypocritical but the idea might have merit. An Atheist's God could give the Athar some weird sort of pseudo-leverage, especially if he/she took it as a 'You-Need-Diamonds-to-Cut-Diamonds' sort of premise (and viewed himself/herself as ultimately anathema, and to be destroyed/de-Godded once all the other Gods have been pulled down off their pedastols).</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>I liked the Godkillers faction in the Astral Plane sourcebook.  I'm surprised they haven't suceeded in picking off a minor god or two.  </p>

<p>Actually, I was rather annoyed that the Athar wouldn't have a special gift or two for any member of their faction that succeeded in preventing both barmies from becoming gods in <span style="font-style:italic">Harbringer House</span>.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">
