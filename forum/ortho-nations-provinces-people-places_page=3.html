          Ortho: Nations, Provinces, People, Places        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>I'm not particularly happy with the following, but its what I've got down so far, so I figured I'd post it and add as necessary...It seems kinda blase...I'm not the best of writers, it's sort of hard to get what I've got in my head down on paper; its a lot easier for me orally, presenting the millieu and then answering questions from players as we play along...Anyway-</p>

<p>GELIDAHL - The Last Province<br />
In the farthest south of Ortho  lies the polar continent-province of Gelidahl (“The Icy Land” in the native Ahltani). Amongst the harshest environments on the planet, it’s a wonder that anyone would opt to live in such a life-threatening place. But humanoids are willing to live anywhere given the right motivation. For Gelidahl, three such groups have had that motivation- the ‘aboriginal’ natives, who traveled here millennia ago to escape the Chaos of Thaera; the capitalists, who came seeking riches in all their forms; and the Harmonium who came to instill order to the last place on Ortho. Gelidahl is a frontier province still coming into its own. It is a place where citizens of Ortho can challenge themselves while still enriching the whole. It is the last place on Ortho.</p>

<p>Geography<br />
Gelidahl can be divided into two primary areas. The first is that small portion that encircle Ortho’s southern pole. It is defined by a freezing climate year round and is covered by glacial ice making it uninhabitable by almost all forms of life. The second area is the Ahlo (“The Life Land”) peninsula which thrusts north between the Sea of Ahltash (“The Landless Place”) and the Sea of Dho. The Ahlo is split into two zones- the lowlands of the east and north and the mountainous south and west. The lowlands are the home to most of the province’s  population, being a mix of tundra coast and semi-forested inland hills.  The eastern and northern shoreline is warm for its latitude due to the warm ocean currents that flow through the Sea of Dho. This warmth allows for some agriculture including potatoes, (?) and (?), although the majority of foodstuffs must be imported from Iironda and Thaera. The eastern coast is arctic cold and is iced in year round for two thirds of its length. The south’s most prominent feature is Mt. Icespire (Ahlina to the Ahltani), rising some 14,000 feet into the southern sky. The mountains surrounding it have been cut into rugged tors and glacier filled valleys and would be completely ignored by man if not for the gold deposits found here over a century ago.</p>

<p>Provincial Government<br />
The provincial government, being relatively new and representing a relatively small population, is based on the federal model with the Legislative Council of Gelidahl, the Executive Triumvirate and the Provincial Courts.  Three representatives are sent from each of the three cities, three from the interior towns and twelve from the indigenous Ahltani clans to the Provincial Council for a total of twenty-four  representatives. Their primary concern is enacting the Laws of the Provinces which is done by majority with ties broken by the Executive Triumvirate’s Observer. Their term of office is determined by the individual constituencies, which varies by entity. </p>

<p>The Executive Triumvirate consists of the Governor-General, the Proctor-General and the Solicitor-General. The Governor-General oversees the province’s policing force, is the senior officer of the provincial Harmonium and holds a minimum rank of Mover One. The Proctor-General is the Head of the Gelidahl Church who is chosen for life by Church Convocation. The Solicitor-General oversees the prosecution of the violation of the province’s laws and is elected from amongst the ranks of the Gelidahl Legal Association. </p>

<p>The Provincial Courts are directed by the Supreme Judge who is recommended by the Executive Triumvirate and confirmed by the Legislative Council. He, in addition to being the First Judge of Yuno, has complete control over the appointment of judges of the civic and circuit courts, although the Legislative Council can recall a judge with sixteen of twenty-four votes to impeach. The Executive Triumvirate is the sole authority of appeal and requires unanimous agreement. Other positions of import such as the Minister of the Interior or the Minister of Revenue are chosen by the Executive Triumvirate and confirmed by the Legislative Council and can be impeached in a manner similar to judges.</p>

<p>Current issues before the Government include: The monopolies of extra-provincial companies within Gelidahl, primarily the whaling cartels of Axon and Nomo. The need to expand the economy beyond whaling and mining with possibilities being weapons research, expansion of trapping and hunting fur-baring fauna and environmental tourism. A bill introduced in the Legislative Council to prohibit the production and consumption of alcohol so as to increase productivity and reduce violence in the whaling ports and interior towns.</p>

<p>Peoples &amp; Settlements<br />
The first people to come to inhabit Gelidahl were tribal refugees fleeing the expanding evils of their homeland, migrants following their shamans away from the islands of South Thaera across the cold waters of the southern seas to a land free of corruption. Collectively calling themselves the Ahltani (“People of the Land”) they quickly adapted to their new home and its extreme climate, taking up fishing and whaling in the surrounding seas and rivers of the Ahlo peninsula and acclimating their belief and social systems as appropriate to their new milieu. The different clans spread out and claimed various lands for their own, coming into conflict with each other every decade or so as a particularly harsh winter brought competition for the same food sources. This was the way of life until about 300 years ago when an elven shaman from the northlands appeared on the land’s shores and began preaching harmonious cooperation amongst the clans when times were hard and bringing forth a more peaceful way to resolve disputes. When the elven lady disappeared as mysteriously as she arrived, the clans encountered no one from the outlands until the whaling cartels arrived over a century later. Today, the Ahltani number in the range of 60,000.</p>

<p>The second group to arrive in Gelidahl were outlanders, first those hunted the whales of the southern seas and needed outposts for their fleets and later on miners. The first such settlement founded was Axon (current pop. 11,000) on the western coast which became the southeastern whaling station for the Valdi Corporation fleet of South Thaera. The other settlement, Nomo (cur. pop. 14,000), was founded several decades later in a natural harbor on the east coast of Gelidahl by the Sapphire Seas Trading Cartel of Han who sponsored the hunting of the sperm whales of the Sea of Dho. With the discovery of gold a century or so ago in the south, both Axon and Nomo grew from company towns to small gateway cities to the interior, although today the primary industry of the two remains the rendering of whale carcasses for their oil, ivory and meat (considered a delicacy in Iironda) and their storage . </p>

<p>The final group in Gelidahl is the Harmonium, who arrived in significant numbers to insure order shortly after the miners came in search of gold in the south. Although the Harmonium had a minor naval base on the northern tip of Gelidahl at Yuno (cur. pop. 8,000), a port that very rarely was ever iced in, assignment there  was considered to be a punishment posting and exploration of the interior had been limited. But when gold deposits of significant size were found and mining companies began coalescing the various strikes into fewer and fewer individual claims, the Harmonium increased their presence to insure fairness of business practices and insure that violence did not become a bargaining tactic. A Governor-General was installed at Yuno and the town became the home of the colony’s courts, being considered a good neutral ground by the diverse groups that made up the population of Gelidahl. Subsequently, minor courts were established in Axon and Nomo and a circuit court was established for the towns of the interior. When the colony was elevated to provincial status, Yuno became the capital.</p>

<p>Sysillia<br />
Sysillia is typical of the few towns of the interior, sprouting up along one of the routes to the gold fields in the south and where three Ahltani clanlands meet. </p>

<p>The Love Camps<br />
The southern portion of the Ahlo peninsula is a bleak land incapable of sustaining all but the most hardy life, but that has not kept folk from trying to find riches here. When gold was found to the north of this region and then slowly gobbled up by mining conglomerates, a few hardy folk set forth into the this harsh land in search of more gold veins, usually dying in the attempt. However, one small group of dwarves from the far reaches of northern [?] were successful in finding not gold, but mithril deep in a crevice below an ice shelf on the slopes of Mt. Icespire. Successful in finding this vein, they were unfortunately unsuccessful in returning to the civililized north of Gelidahl, having been slain by pack of Polar Shimmercats (a.k.a. Albino Displacer Beasts). Their corpses were found by a Harmonium patrol who found a map back to the mithril find and upon speaking with the spirits of the dead dwarves, the secret of the mithril vein was the property of the Harmonium. </p>

<p>With that secret arose The Love Camps, underground gulags that would mine the large mithril and adamantite veins that lie below Mt. Icespire, the result, it is theorized, of a meteor that crashed to Ortho eons ago when Ortho’s second moon exploded. The primary goal of the camps is to rehabilitate the prisoners so that they might reenter society and be a productive member of it. Of course, the mithril and adamantine that is mined and refined here is a great resource for the Harmonium. Since the time of its initial founding, the Love Camps have grown to three distinct compounds following three distinct veins and based on alignment. They are Pure Love Camp, Tough Love Camp and Harsh Love Camp.</p>

In the farthest south of Ortho  lies the polar continent-province of Gelidahl (“The Icy Land” in the native Ahltani).

Ohhhhh - native languages rock. </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Current issues before the Government include: The monopolies of extra-provincial companies within Gelidahl, primarily the whaling cartels of Axon and Nomo. The need to expand the economy beyond whaling and mining with possibilities being weapons research, expansion of trapping and hunting fur-baring fauna and environmental tourism. The Prohibition of Alcohol to increase productivity and reduce violence in the whaling ports and interior towns.</div>
I really like this sort of detail that you've got here. It paints a really clear picture of the entire place in one fell swoop. Now - how on earth did they manage to prohibit alcohol? In a lot of places it was the only way to make sure the water wouldn't kill you - was to water down your wine with booze before you drank it. Is there a counter prohibition movement going on? Perhaps even *gasp* smuggling?! <img src="http://planewalker.com/sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/wink.png" title="Eye-wink" alt="Eye-wink" class="smiley-content"/></p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>This was the way of life until about 300 years ago when an elven shaman from the northlands appeared on the land’s shores and began preaching harmonious cooperation amongst the clans when times were hard and bringing forth a more peaceful way to resolve disputes. When the elven lady disappeared as mysteriously as she arrived, the clans encountered no one from the outlands until the whaling cartels arrived over a century later. Today, the Ahltani number in the range of 60,000.
</div>
Nice touch. I assume the lady is still revered quietly?</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>However, one small group of dwarves from the far reaches of northern [?] were successful in finding not gold, but mithril deep in a crevice below an ice shelf on the slopes of Mt. Icespire. </div>
Finally the dwarves get some loving from one of our writers! <img src="http://planewalker.com/sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/wink.png" title="Eye-wink" alt="Eye-wink" class="smiley-content"/></p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Successful in finding this vein, they were unfortunately unsuccessful in returning to the civililized north of Gelidahl, having been slain by pack of snow displacer beasts.</div>
Is that critter in the MM?</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Their corpses were found by a Harmonium patrol who found a map back to the mithril find and upon speaking with the spirits of the dead dwarves, the secret of the mithril vein was the property of the Harmonium.</div> 
And/or do you want to imply that the Hardheads did them in for the loot?</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>The Forest of J’hileos<br />
A dark haunted place once revered by the elves, and now under a closely guarded quarantine.  </p>

<p>The Forest of J’hileos is the site of an ancient Elvin temple complex built belowground and above of the living forest itself.  Most of the forest has been clear-cut, cleansed and purified but the center temple complex and several outlying structures remain, despite the best efforts of the Harmonium.<br />
The main site, the largest of the twelve quarantine areas lies on a hill with a depression at its northern end about eight miles from the limits of Ortho’s capitol city.  The site is surrounded by a wall seventy feet high and at least as deep under ground made of solid granite blocks.  The casing stones of the wall, on both sides, as well as below ground all have one of four protective runes carved into their outer surface and are polished.  The wall has no gates or towers its crenellated top broken only by covered stone guard posts every eighth of a mile each with its own staircase down to the outside base.  All freestanding structures permanent for more than a week within one half mile of the wall are required to be raised about one foot off the ground on a solid stone or fired-brick base.  Most of the subsidized farmers in the area triple this requirement for their own homes.<br />
  I'll finish it later.</div></p>

<p>I stuck this on in harmony's Glory. It seemed to make the best sense in that not-a-province province.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>BTW: Congradulations all!! I did some checking and we are now sitting at 72 pages, single spaced for our document. This project is also just a few days over *one* month old. That's half of a book - in one *month*. There are publishers who would kill small Hive children for that sort of turn around.</p>

<p>[pep talk]<br />
I'm aiming to have this thing *done* as of January 25th. That's two weeks to finish kicking things into high gear and get all of it pulled together for final editting. Then the rest of January is editting and checking for consistancy - aiming for a release on Feb. 1st. A book  - in two months.</p>

<p>Think we can do it? *grin* <br />

I really like this sort of detail that you've got here. It paints a really clear picture of the entire place in one fell swoop. Now - how on earth did they manage to prohibit alcohol? In a lot of places it was the only way to make sure the water wouldn't kill you - was to water down your wine with booze before you drank it. Is there a counter prohibition movement going on? Perhaps even *gasp* smuggling?! <img src="http://planewalker.com/sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/wink.png" title="Eye-wink" alt="Eye-wink" class="smiley-content"/></div>
Perhaps I should have phrased it as a bill introduced to the Provincial Council to prohibit the production and consumption of alcohol...Of course, there would be folks on both sides of the debate, the Anti-Prohibition folk possibly bringing up the very point you have...This might in turn bring up a debate on restrictions on the amount of consumption per capita, stiffer penalties for public intoxication and alcohol related violence, etc. ...As to smuggling, as all know, there is no smuggling on Ortho, it's against the law...</p>

Nice touch. I assume the lady is still revered quietly?</div>
Along with at least one other god, Kaji the Fox...I figure that the Ahltani have two religious lives...Those while outside the clan and that within the clan...Outside the clan, say when they are in a town or city, they attend the Church of Law as necessary; on Clanlands they worship in the tradition of the Forgotten Goddess, although only the Shamans would know that they do so, feeling that they are following the true path of harmony...</p>

Not really, just found them by happenstance (or fate) and reaped the reward...The 'snow displacer beasts' did them in...Also, generally no one outside of the members of the Harmonium party and their superiors know about the dwarven miners and few if anyone outside the justice system knows the location of the Love Camps...At least, that's the premise...

         <p>The Forest of J’hileos<br />
A dark haunted place once revered by the elves, and now under a closely guarded quarantine.</p>

<p>The Forest of J’hileos is the site of an ancient Elvin temple complex built below ground and above of the living forest itself. Most of the forest has been clear-cut, cleansed and purified but the center temple complex and several outlying structures remain, despite the best efforts of the Harmonium.</p>

<p>The main site, the largest of the twelve quarantine areas lies on a hill with a depression at its northern end about eight miles from the limits of Ortho’s capitol city. The site is surrounded by a wall seventy feet high and at least as deep under ground made of solid granite blocks. The casing stones of the wall, on both sides, as well as below ground all have one of four protective runes carved into their outer surface and are polished. The wall has no gates or towers its crenelated top broken only by covered stone guard posts every eighth of a mile each with its own staircase down to the outside base.   Similar walls surround the other eleven sites and combined they cover around a hundred and eighty square miles that was originally the bounds of the destroyed forest city.</p>

<p>All freestanding structures permanent for more than a week within one half mile of the wall are required to be raised about one foot off the ground on a solid stone or fired-brick base.  This includes sign and fence posts and farmers can be fined for leaving a wooden ladder or wooden wagon wheels in place on the dirt soil ground for more than seven days.  Most of the subsidized farmers in the area triple this requirement for their own homes and are very observant of the law on their own even without the Harmonium patrols that guard the area.  Another law forbids the cultivation of any wooded plant-life, and requires that all trees in the area are to be chopped down and rooted out if possible with-in a week of their discovery; if it is not possible farmers are required to report the tree growth to one of the regular patrols.  The reason for all of this security is because of the lingering elven enchantments in the area.  All plants, including the grains and vegetables grown by the subsidized farm steads, grow at a drastically accelerated rate.  Farms often produce five to six times what comparable farms further away from the elven ruins.  However, trees grow faster than most plants, and will either start to form into buildings or more rarely form into the 'sentinals' that originally guarded the destroyed elven city.  It takes eight weeks for a sentinel to fully form and become mobile attacking the Harmonium patrols and farmers.  Wood objects left in contact with the soil will root and are more likely to become a sentinel rather than a building.  For every tree growing in the area there is a ninety-percent chance that it forms into a building, and a ten percent chance that it will form a sentinel.  For rooted wooden items such as a ladder or dropped farm implement the chance of becoming a sentinel increases by five percent.  For larger items such as wagons and small out-buildings this increase is ten percent and large buildings have a forty percent chance of becoming a sentinel.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

Perhaps...It seems that of late, the only people still actively involved are you (Clueless), me (Kwint), Rip, Eldersphinx and Gerzel...I would recommend trying to get in contact with those other folks who were, in some fashion, more involved early on- OpheliaWhispers, nick012000, Fell, Nemui, Bob the Efreet, Primus- the One and Prime, Surreal Personae, Fidrikon, and Lubaf...Now, I understand that it's all voluntary and that folks have varied levels of available time, but to get it done by the end of January, I think that more people will have to contribute...

<p>You set the standard for what a province looks like... It's one of the most detailed ones we've got! What's this about 'everyone else is better'? Bah. If you wanna lay claim to another one and see if you can outdo yourself while you work on simmering rip's suggestions with the beholders - I say go for it. </p>

<p>Even commentary and questions are useful in something like this. When someone askes questions - they have to get answered - which generally means more stuff gets written. <img src="http://planewalker.com/sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/wink.png" title="Eye-wink" alt="Eye-wink" class="smiley-content"/></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Here is an update on the Eight Jewels of Harmony: The eight mainstay colonies of the Harmonium.</p>

<p>	Intagril the oldest of the eight provides the Harmonium with many formidable spell casters and a great deal of magical equipment.  Before the first official expedition from Ortho came to Intagril the world was already coming to accept the principals of the Harmonium.  Less than a century before the world had been at the edge of complete warfare after over four hundred years of bad-blood.  Then the two nations that controlled the sphere united under the banner of Harmony, brought to them by the appearance of one of Ortho's greatest orators and bards, Enoril.  This was several years after he had disappeared from the sphere of Ortho, and it was a relief when the expedition confirmed his identity as the savior of this primeworld.  The world of Integral was established as a colony nearly fifty years before the Harmonium entered into the War of Iron.  During the war Integral put its massive magical and weapon stockpiles, originally intended to be used against one another to a higher purpose using them against the hoards of demons that filled the Abyss.  Furthermore, the world gave over five-hundred-million soldiers to the great armies of Harmony in the attempt to take the Abyss.</p>

<p>	Anoc is the largest of the eight jewels even with only half of its prime sphere actually occupied by the Harmonium.  It is a huge world of plains and sky, with relatively few mountains.  Only Anoc's Northern hemisphere is inhabited as the equator is far too hot for any permanent settlement.  The southern portion of the sphere is largely unexplored due to veins of ore that seem to block divination and travel to the South is exceptionally hazardous.  The colony exports a large portion of the grains consumed throughout the Harmonium.</p>

<p>	Arcadia is the great colony of the outer planes.  It is the great training and staging ground for the armies of the Harmonium.  &lt;&gt;</p>

<p>	Meter is the most politically outspoken of the eight jewels, at the fore for the push to become a province and demanding rights for its citizens.  While this does cause tension the colony spans the entire prime sphere and has provided some of the best generals, officers and elite forces that the Harmonium has ever seen.  It also is rich in both agriculture and mining recourses.&lt;&gt;</p>

<p>	Lucidia is a small colony built on the moon orbiting a fiery volcanic prime sphere.  It is the base for a great many spell-jamming ships and is a large port of call helping to protect four major trade routes.  Due to the small fleet of and Ortho's appropriation of the ships to protect its sphere there is only a small fleet of jammers to protect Lucidia and its space.  Still the moon is able to field a potent defense through joint operations of the Harmonium's fleet stationed there and the larger fleet of merchant ships that keep the port as their home.  &lt;&gt;</p>

<p>	Fjorge is a world inhabited by a race of small industrious insectile creatures, called the K'jinte.  The first explorers from the Harmonium where quickly drawn into negotiating between two hives.  Now the Harmonium has brought peace to the world by acting as mediators between the hive-clans.  The K'jinte are a strong industrious race that have taken a natural ease to adapting to the Harmonium way of life individually.  The only problems come from competition between hives as their warriors pheromones will cause them to attack warriors of another hive automatically.  Thus while K'jinte armies are highly efficient the generals of the Harmonium must be careful not to mix warriors from different hives. &lt;&gt;</p>

<p>	Anara is the great industrial world blessed with great veins of ore and thick forests.  It has only been colonized for a hundred years but has quickly become a vital part of the Harmonium's economy. &lt;&gt;</p>

<p>	Eallia is a ocean covered water world ruled by two nations ruled by the aboleth and one of sahuagin.  The colony provides a large supply of algae and fish food stocks.  Both nations have a large population of sea-elves that tend most of the fish stocks, kelp beds and undersea mines.  Before the Harmonium came the elves were entirely subjugated as slaves but now they are free by the same proclamation that brought the world officially into the Harmonium.  Still it seems that the former slaves have not all adapted well to their new found freedom and Harmonium peacekeepers have been brought in to help settle the unrest.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Darks of Intagril<br />
The integrator did not leave as the legend says.  Instead, after his meeting at the palace he met with the high ranks, the leaders, and to the secret places of the world.  The nations of Sea and Sky had been at a cold smoldering war for nearly four hundred years and had been in open warfare for hundreds of years before that time with each other and with smaller nations that where eventually crushed or absorbed into the two larger.  Though the war had not been waged on any battlefield it had been waged, and its combatants had honed their skills over the centuries.  Secrets, espionage, and all the other unseen arts of war had been developed along side the more well known of the warrior arts.</p>

<p>Intagril came into the Harmonium with its upper echelons knowing fully what they were going into and much of the history of Ortho that the Harmonium keeps out of the history books.  Furthermore, the secret projects and bases hidden in the dark corners of the world and in Intagril's star system have largely been kept from the Council of Ortho and the Octaves as well as the rest of the Harmonium.  This was accomplished simply because the world of Intagril had already united and formed a world government in line with the Harmonium before they joined.  Thus there was no need to reorganize and the colony never gave the Harmonium leadership the excuse it needed to take full control of their government.</p>

<p>Outwardly, the colonial government of Intagril follows ever rule, every order handed down to it working in perfect time with the greater Harmony.  Still the colony has always gathered an amount of suspicion because of the known activities of Enoril while he was still on Ortho.  The high-ups in the Ortho chain of command would have liked to push Enoril's memory to a far page deeply hidden in the book of History for his support of the elves and his protest against the expansionist policies in the Harmonium's leadership.  Still after the support that Intagril gave to the War of Iron with millions of lives sacrificed for the greater glory of Harmony.</p>

<p>During the War of Iron great spells from Intagril's magic wielders swept over the battlefields tearing millions of tan'ar'i apart in controlled hurricanes of iron shards that covered entire layers of the Abyss.  Great war machines went to work against the demon hoards and saved many millions of Harmonium lives.  Yet the greatest spells and laboratories from whence they came have been kept secret from the Harmonium.  Furthermore, while Intagril was the first people to introduce spell-jamming to the Harmonium rumors persist that the world has an entire fleet operating outside the control of the larger Harmony.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

So, does anyone want to take Ruko/Province #3...My knowledge of Japanese History &amp; culture and Oriental Adventures Gaming is pretty sketchy...There's always someone in a gaming group who is a Nippon-o-phile; who is it in this writing group?...

Uh, sorry...Didn't mean to evoke your hate response...Didn't even mean to suggest that you should do that particular province...But it does seem that that continent (Athra, I believe...Rip?) is pretty pseudo-Asian, so maybe Roku is instead pseudo-Koryoan (perhaps in this world, the pseudo-Koreans defeated the pseudo-Japanese)...Or, orrrrrrrrr...

I had been thinking #7 or #10 would be best for that, though I've not really defined anything more specific than that.</div></p>

<p>Following up on this notion - a sort of wedge to explain how a province of werewolves and other lycanthropes might survive and prosper in the Harmonium's Ortho.  Not sure if I'm going to throw additional province info in, but this may spark a few ideas from others.</p>

<p>----</p>

<p>The barren, ice-swept lands of Ulfrheim are home to many kinds of lycanthropes, creatures who survive in this inhospitable land mainly by changing into animal form during the long winter months, and travelling as packs through the wilderness. Of all the lycanthropic kindreds of this land, werewolves are the most common; unusually enough, these werewolves do not harbor the chaotic inclinations of their kindred on other worlds, but are dedicated to the ways of order and law. Such a change is not happy coincidence, however, but a mandated imposition - created by a magical invocation called Kelmuun's Bond of the Wolfpack.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">This effect uses the <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/variant/magic/incantations.htm" class="bb-url">incantation</a> rules originally published in Unearthed Arcana. Reading up on the rules and campaign use of these effects is recommended.</span></p>

Effective Level: 8th<br />
Skill Check: Diplomacy DC 28, 4 successes; Handle Animal DC 28, 1 success; Knowledge (nature) DC 28, 2 successes; Survival DC 28, 1 success<br />
Failure: Attack<br />
Components: V,S,F,XP,SC,B<br />
Casting Time: 80 minutes<br />
Range: See text<br />
Area: Ring formed by casters, no more than 50 feet in diameter<br />
Duration: Permanent<br />
Saving Throw: Will negates (DC 19 + caster's Cha modifier)<br />
Spell Resistance: Yes</p>

<p>Kelmuun's Bond of the Wolfpack invokes the ways of pack law and dominance in the hearts of werewolves, cleansing them of the maddening taint of the moon and reconsecrating them to the way of order. The casters form a ring around the werewolves to be affected by the incantation, appealing in different and varied ways to the creatures' inner sense of self and condemning the blight of lunar chaos. As the rite progesses, the targets become calmer and more controlled, less prey to savage and disruptive instincts, until as the invocation completes they are reborn as creatures of hierarchy and law.</p>

<p>The incantation only affects werewolves (natural or afflicted), permanently changing their alignment to Lawful Evil if they fail a Will save. This overrides the werewolf's preferred alignment, but does not block other effects that affect alignment.</p>

<p>The targets to be affected by the incantation need not be restrained or rendered helpless, but must remain within the ring of casters. They may freely attack the casters if they so choose. As a result, the spell is normally cast on targets that either accede to the incantation, or who have been rendered helpless by some other means.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Failure</span><br />
A gelugon (or other CR 13 devil) is summoned to attack the casters. After fifteen rounds or the death of all casters, whichever happens first, it returns to the infernal realms. It will not normally attack the spell's targets or bystanders, but will defend itself if attacked.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Focus</span><br />
A finely crafted wolf's mask made of silver with inlaid gemstones, worth 5,000 gp.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">XP Cost</span><br />
400 XP.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Backlash</span><br />
All casters are exhausted upon the spell's completion.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Extra Casters</span><br />
Fifteen individuals are required; they space themselves in a ring along with the primary caster, reiterating and reinforcing the dictums and arguments presented.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Campaign Use</span><br />
Kelmuun's Bond of the Wolfpack is a campaign tool used by the Harmonium, used to tame new werewolf cubs and undiscovered rogue tribes alike. It's not likely to be directly employed by PC groups.</p>

<p>The unrevealed dark of the incantation, though, could provide adventuring hooks in either of two directions. The first possibility lies in the identity of Kelmuun, the spell's creator - hailed by the Harmonium as an early hero, but quite possibly a druidic devotee of the Forbidden Goddess, instead. In this circumstance, Kelmuun created the incantation not so much to extend the Harmonium's creed as to provide some alternative to a bloody, irrevocable genocide of all the werewolves of Ulfrheim. In this instance, the invocation could certainly have some hidden flaw that could allow its effects to be undone or reversed - an opportunity, or a threat...</p>

<p>The other possibility is that the incantation doesn't invoke principles of natural law, but instead imposes devilish influence on its targets. As a result, the lords of Baator have, for the past several centuries, slowly and imperceptibly been forging a hellish army in a corner of Ortho. Such a thing might not be an immediate cause of alarm for the Harmonium, but would certainly worry many other players both planar and prime - and how do such individuals convince the Harmonium to abandon their effort?</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

</div>
We know where the province is - it's the one south of Motmurk (#9) - we just haven't had anyone write up anythign about it yet.</div>
Perhaps the problem is that dwarves are tradtionally associated with mining and living 'neath the mountains while Province #9 is described in the pdf as "Southern Motmurk would be the best place to have the harvest land, Think the middle of America," and is generally portrayed on the geography map as a land of plains and hills....</p>

         <p>The traditional dwarven kingdom (which I'm calling Xaric for now, after the dwarven realm in Shemmy's story) would be in the mountains of central Motmurk, while there's plenty of room for human lands in the lowlands. The humans, I think, would largely have colonized this continent from the east, long ago in the fabled Second Dynasty of Han (not that Han or even anyone in Iironda had anything to do with this migration), crossing the channel from Province #5 to Province #7 (Ulfrheim?) and continuing southwest from there.</p>

<p>That's not to say that all Orthoan dwarves are miners; a lot of them will have become integrated into human society after 500 years of Harmonium "Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity" - a lot of races will not only take nontraditional occupations by now, but they might actually be <span style="font-style:italic">required</span> to for the sake of harmony.</p>

<p>Anyway, Threerivers is very much a mixed-race city. The confluence of three rivers that gives the city its name also symbolize the confederation of the three races common to the continent: humans, dwarves, and orcs.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Liberty?  Ok I can agree with equality and Fraternity but Liberty just sounds dangrous.</div></p>

<p>It would be, if it were actual Liberty in the general sense.</p>

<p>But "Liberty, Equality, Fraternity" was actually the slogan of the French Revolution, and Liberty really wasn't something that was actually gained from that.</p>

<p>From the perspective of the Knights of Harmony, they <span style="font-style:italic">were</span> liberating the world from the tyranny of war, and from the tyranny of the various tyrants as well. </p>

<p>From the perspective of the Harmonium, this liberty is something that can only be preserved through mutual accord. Giving everyone the "liberty" to believe whatever they want would result in a return to the old tyrannies of the Age of Deep Darkness. Complete freedom would quite literally result in slavery for the masses. True Liberty can only be found in endenturing oneself in servitude to Harmony and Accord. It is this Liberty which the Harmonium hopes to embody.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Re: the Chaotic werewolves we may also want to play up the idea of a pack vs. a lone wolf. As far as I understand how werewolves are intended to be used in the MM it is as a loner, the one wolf ravaging the village in the middle of winter sort of thing. </p>

<p>Now - loner wolves, wolves that have been kicked out of their packs - are generally kicked out for a reason. They're too agressive, the pack doesn't like them, personality issues and the like. So I could see chaotic evil in them easily.</p>

<p>But put a wolf within a pack led by a strong alpha (aka - how wolves are normally found) and things are quite different. Within a pack they follow a closely set order - even the lowest on the totem pole has his job as a typical puppy babysitter, or lookout. There may be fighting to get ahead in the order - but the order is still observed.</p>

<p>This contrast might also be something to play up to with the werewolves in that lycanthrope area. Where the loner were's are often CE and hunted down by local alphas and the pack.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>The Realm of R'Talnir<br />
	This is the only colony of Ortho to have become a colony, been brought to accept the Harmonium ideal and then rebel against Ortho and the greater Harmony it gave to the world.</p>

<p>	R'Talnir was one of the first handful of worlds to be colonized brought into the greater Harmony in that first short wave of planar expansion before the Harmonium learned of the Abyss and set upon the War of Iron.  It is a small world of oceans, deserts and mountains with two small suns, one red one white.  While the surface is only habitable in the small oases that dot the higher part of the northern continents and the surviving belt of tropical forests that lies on the southern continent the world has an extensive underground network of aquifers, rivers, caverns and tunnels dug out during the nearly-forgotten heyday of R'Talnir's civilization.  The underground network had been an effort to save the world from its desertification but along the way as famine set in so did chaos and eventually anarchy.  The once great laws of civilization where sadly forgotten, until the day that the first Harmonium expedition showed up.</p>

<p>	With the help of Harmonium mages, clerics and druids as well as Harmonium organization the clans and tribes that the old civilization had broken into where re-united and the main aquifers were repaired and cleansed.  The light of civilization had not completely faded from this world and the people remembered the glories of their past.  With the coming of the greater light of true Harmony the people rejoiced and as the waters flowed again so did the world re-unite.  From all accounts it was a splendid time lasting twenty years or so.  However, during that time investigations began into what caused the great upheavals as according to the historical record they had begun well before the major famines set in.  Portals to the Abyss where found as well as ruined temples to foul gods and demon spawn.</p>

<p>	R'Talnir stands for those who are high enough in the Harmonium to know about it, as a monument and example of why history must be controlled and carefully censored for the masses.  This is because once the people of R'Talnir started to learn of the Abyssal involvement they started to fear and resent any other-planar contact, even contact from other primes and Ortho itself.  The people rejoined in their nation and while thanking the Harmonium for their help pushed them out of their world by force and somehow sealed most of the portals.  Tales from those darkening times tell of the people casting off and discarding the gods they had come so recently to worship; gods brought to them by the Harmonium after the people had lost their own during the worlds previous trials.  Tales tell of that world establishing their own government and then declaring separation from the Harmonium along with many other strict and harsh laws before casting the Harmonium out.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Following up on this notion - a sort of wedge to explain how a province of werewolves and other lycanthropes might survive and prosper in the Harmonium's Ortho.  Not sure if I'm going to throw additional province info in, but this may spark a few ideas from others.</div></p>

<p>Perhaps the northern tundra of Province #10 is the provincial district Ulfrheim, while the midlands are pine forests with the peninsula that extends in the southeast being inhabited by a lightskinned, light haired, cool-color eyed folk who formerly were sea reavers in association with Alzrius against Pan Thaera...And/or, perhaps Ulfrheim is a trans-provincial area that runs along the entirity of the continent of Mot (Rip?) much as Lappland runs across the northern portion of the Fino-Scandanavian lands...<br />

<p>I'd be happy to have the help or even hand off the colony write up to you for further expansion on it.</p>

<p>Integral is pretty much finished pending editing.</p>

<p>Anoc, Meter and Anara all need a good deal more attention.  Meter especially as right now it is only a resource rich industrial center.</p>

<p>I really need more research to finish off Arcadia aka need to get that mangy loth shemeska in a corner and get the pdfs out of her.</p>

<p>Lucidia I am fairly happy with, but need to read up and get up with Rip on his ideas for that red lichen.  For that matter Anara too.</p>

<p>Fjorge is what I'm currently working on and am debating putting the Thrycrin in control of that world.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

My recommendation would be post all you have here so that whoever wanted to add to it could...Truth be told, I really don't have much interest in the colonies beyond a one paragraph synopsis...I do have an interest in Ortho, the planet- the flushing out of the provinces, social structures, history &amp; mythology, maps &amp; geography and demographics...I would like to know what a majority of people think about ideas concerning those aspects of Ortho, thus my questions and promptings (in this case the Merfolk)...I guess I'd rather know more about where the Harmonium came from than where they went (with the possible exception of the planes)...This is not to say you shouldn't write all you want 'bout the colonies, it's just that it isn't my cup o' tea...<br />

         <p>I was looking over the Feats section of the pdf and something struck me (No, No, it wasn't my girlfriend smacking me for once again paying more attention to the computer than to her)...IIRC, in the Unearthed Arcan there are 'Anti-Feats' (can't remember their actual appelation) which give the character an extra feat in exchange for something negative...Does this sound familiar to anyone?...Anyway, I was wondering if we could include one that gave the restrictions of 2nd ed. Hardheads [Disobedience requires <span style="font-style:italic">atonement</span>. Refusal is punishable by death.] and in turn would have one of the Harmonium Feats linked to it, one that would be temporarily lost from the point that the Hardhead was 'disobedient' until they had received <span style="font-style:italic">atonement</span>...Something similar to Runequest's Gifts &amp; Geases' (of Humakt and Yelmalio, for those who know who they are)...Just an idea...<br />

<p>I'm not sure about this part of Gerzel's otherwise excellent Intagril article, since millions of Harmonium didn't return from the War of Iron - if there had been millions remaining, the war would have continued. They were <span style="font-style:italic">very</span> stubborn, those Hardheads, and the Abyssal Lords rewarded them accordingly. You don't invade the realm of the goddess Kali, as the <span style="font-style:italic">Factol's Manifesto</span> said they did, and get to make an ordered, strategic retreat.

<p>I'm not sure about this part of Gerzel's otherwise excellent Intagril article, since millions of Harmonium didn't return from the War of Iron - if there had been millions remaining, the war would have continued.

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Meter </span>is the most politically outspoken of the eight jewels, at the fore for the push to become a province and demanding rights for its citizens. While this causes tension, the colony spans the entire prime sphere and has provided some of the best generals, officers and elite forces that the Harmonium has ever seen. It also is rich in both agriculture and mining recourses. </p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">History</span>. <br />
Fifteen hundred years ago, Meter was the home of a magically and culturally advanced empire from which the world takes its modern name. The Old Empire of Meter, or <span style="font-style:italic">the </span>Meter as it was known at the time, believed that division was the key to effective conquest, and that maintaining an ordered division was the key to retaining its holdings. This it did with great efficiency, and for eight hundred years the Meter ruled the world, extending even to other worlds in the same system, masterfully manipulating its composite states against one another in accordance with an ancient philosophical work, the <span style="font-style:italic">Book of Measurements.</span></p>

<p>Seven hundred years ago, a religious movement formed among the common folk, worshipping the first dynasty of the Meter as gods. The authorities at first encouraged this practice, believing it strengthened obedience to the state. As it turned out, the movement - which became known as the Unity - did just the opposite. </p>

<p>The Unity started out harmless enough, deriving a host of gods of law, agriculture, music, and other important spheres of influence from the first dozen emperors of the Meter. The authorities were a bit bemused at their enthusiasm - certainly the emperors had been deified and everyone was <span style="font-style:italic">supposed</span> to worship them, but in practice the cult had been up to that point perfunctory at best. They didn’t even notice when what began as a new group of useful divinities started to develop a <span style="font-style:italic">philosophy</span>. Whether this creed originated among the mortal priests or among the deified emperors themselves - grown proud with the sudden influx of truly devout worship - is not clear, but its results are. With the advent of the Unity, suddenly people of all species and ethnic groups had something in common, a single group of gods - for the Meter touched all groups, where their native faiths had not - that all peoples could relate to. And the new philosophy of Unity made the most of this, encouraging people who would otherwise not even speak together to worship together, to bind together their hopes and dreams in this universe and the next.</p>

<p>The result, for the government of the Meter, was disastrous. Nothing in the <span style="font-style:italic">Book of Measurements</span> had prepared them for this eventuality; a universal religion had been inconceivable to its writers. Gods fought one another over followers and encouraged their followers to do the same: that was the nature of gods. It was what they <span style="font-style:italic">were</span>. For eight hundred years, the empire had taken advantage of that fact. And now, in an extraordinary example of cosmic irony, the nature of the empire itself had created a series of gods who were strong enough to defeat them all. </p>

<p>Within the rapidly growing Unity, the conflict and strife that the Meter had built itself on turned to unity and harmony. The Meter tried persecuting the church, tried martyring its members and feeding them to the dragon-cats, but the Unity only grew stronger. Eventually one emperor tried mainstreaming the church by declaring it official, but this only accelerated the empire’s decline. </p>

<p>The power of the priests of Unity eclipsed that of the Emperor himself, and that sealed its doom. The Meter finally died not from invasion or bloody revolution; it simply became unnecessary as the Unity slowly took over all its functions. When the last Emperor packed up his things and retired to a quiet life of fishing, scarcely anyone noticed.</p>

<p>But without conflict, there was also little reason for civilization to advance, or indeed for civilization. Although the deified emperors mostly presided over practical concerns, the emphasis of the Unity was in the spiritual, not the temporal, and this trend became exaggerated as the temporal rulers vanished. </p>

<p>Spelljamming technology was the first to be lost. With little demand for magical armaments in the new, peaceful sphere of Meter, the mercanes sought more profitable worlds. As their remaining helms got lost, they became harder and harder to replace, and soon the worlds lost contact with one another. </p>

<p>Next to go was arcane magic. With combat mages no longer needed, the great schools of arcane learning were disbanded, and wizardry was left to individual tutors to continue on their own. The books of spells became lost or scattered, and much of the learning of old was forgotten. </p>

<p>Finally even divine magic became simplified. With no major competitors, the deified emperors grew complacent and thought it no longer necessary to spend their powers improving their clerics. They continued to grant enough spells to keep the common folk happy, but the days of flashy miracles were over.</p>

<p>Within a few centuries, Meter had declined from a dramatic world of powerful spells and constant action to a sleepy agrarian place where nothing much seemed to happen. Apart from the increasingly distant Church of Unity, all interactions were at a purely local level. </p>

<p>Then the wars started.</p>

<p>It is thought that it was a local landowner or a rogue bishop who first came across an old copy of the <span style="font-style:italic">Book of Measurements</span>. Because the tongue in which it had been written was long forgotten, the translation was spotty, but the basic lesson of personal power through strife was learned. In a decade the entire continent was engulfed in battles, and the Church of Unity, despite numerous excommunications and edicts, was no longer powerful enough to stop it.</p>

<p>The wars efficiently destroyed what bits of the Meter’s civilization which still remained. Eventually even the Church was broken as a schism emerged between what was called the Traditional Church and what became known as the Purified Church, which sought to do away with centuries of ornate ritual and clerical priviledge to concentrate on the core principles of unity of all peoples. The Traditional Church sought to destroy the Purified Church with all the resources still at its disposal, while the Purified Church sought to do the same. </p>

<p>Only a few centuries ago, a new player emerged. A woman named Rose Talbot appeared in a small island nation-state, offering technical and magical knowledge to a faction dedicated to the Purified Church there like nothing that the declined peoples of Meter had conceived of. The government of that island quicky changed, and grew to dominate several continents, shattering the structure of the Traditional Church, driving its clerics underground or forcing them to change faiths. Talbot revealed herself to be part of a planewalking organization she called the Harmonium that she said had a philosophy similar to that of the original Church of Unity; she said the Harmonium would help the world regain its lost glory. The grateful Purified Church agreed to an alliance. Within a few more decades, the Harmonium considered Meter to be essentially pacified and welcomed it as Ortho’s “little sister,” soon to be considered one of the Eight Jewels of Harmony. </p>

<p>More recently, however, the relationship between Ortho and Meter has changed. Meterites have begun complaining that Ortho has gained much from Meter’s agricultural and mineral resources, from its generals and troops, but since its technical aid in the original Unification Ortho has given back little. Some have been muttering that when the Harmonium offered to teach the people of Meter, what it really wanted was to steal the secrets of the Old Empire, which it has done while restricting natives from learning much of it themselves. </p>

<p>The sliding of Nemausus was especially bitter for Meter, as it was Meter’s elite troops that helped bring order to the colony in the wake of the upheaval. The people of Meter believe they should be rewarded for this with a status equal to that of Ortho’s own provinces. They are sick of being a mere colony and demand to be treated as equals with the same representation in Ortho’s Council and access to Meter’s wealth and ancient knowledge as citizens of Ortho get. Thus far, their demands have gone unanswered.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Population.</span><br />
Meter has four major races: humans, the elephantine <a href="http://www.enworld.org/cc/converted/view_c.php?CreatureID=464" class="bb-url">loxoth</a>, the hippopotamus-like <a href="http://spelljammer.org/monsters/conversions/Giff.html" class="bb-url">giff</a>, and the rhinoceros-like rheks. Humans are the dominant race, with the semi-nomadic loxoth a fairly close second in the forests, mountains, deserts, and other uncultivated parts of the world. The loxoth fit into the ecology of Measure much as elves, centaurs, and halflings do in other worlds.</p>

<p>The giff, the least common, live mainly in urban areas, serving in the world’s armies and navies. They are believed to be not native, having been brought to Meter in the last days of the Old Empire before the Church of Unity’s triumph in an attempt to slow the church’s ascent. The giff today are as faithful church-goers as any, though their worship isn’t devout. </p>

<p>Most distinctive are the rheks, who until the Harmonium brought them elsewhere were known in no other sphere. These powerful monastic creatures were the chief enforcers of order in the Old Empire, solidly squelching dissent within a given district to insure that citizens disagreed with one another in carefully measured ways. During the civil wars of a few centuries ago they appeared on both sides of the conflict, serving both feuding churches with discipline and honor. After the sliding of Nemausus they were the primary difference between anarchy and the tenuous peace that was eventually established there, and the Harmonium has found them invaluable in a variety of theaters. </p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">The Sphere.</span><br />
The crystal sphere of Meter has within it six inhabitable worlds. </p>

<p>The primary, called the Furnace, is an enormous fire world, a red giant. It has no known inhabitants other than the odd elemental visiting from the Plane of Fire.</p>

<p>Orbiting the Furnace are three smaller stars, known as the Three Candles. They are each alike, pale and yellow-white, barely visible in the Furnace’s scarlet glare but helping to widen the spectrum of light available on the six inhabited worlds. Even fire elementals generally disdain the Candles.</p>

<p>The six inhabited worlds are, from innermost to outermost, Rhyme, Reason, Meter, Pyrrhus, Iamb, and Trochee. Each of these worlds was once part of the Old Empire of Meter. Rhyme is a jungle world inhabited by halfling-sized catlike creatures, Reason is another jungle world with a unique race of its own, Pyrrhus is a fire world, Iamb is a fire world with a water world orbiting it, and Trochee is a water world with a fire world orbiting it. Iamb and Trochee have populations similar to that of Meter, having been originally colonized by that world in the time of the Old Empire. Despite their distance from the Furnace, Iamb and Trochee are temperate thanks to the proxmity of Pyrrhus.</p>

<p>The only one of these worlds the Harmonium has not made substantial progress with thus far is Reason, which is dominated by a slender race of giant-sized immortal carnivores; not vampires, but a living species which regenerates itself instead of reproducing. Being absolutely still and constant and desiring a multiverse which is much the same, they are parlaying with Harmonium representatives, trying to work out a mutually compatible philosophy. Things are going well, but the natives are so slow in their routines that it may be a century or so before the first preliminary treaty is drafted, and the Harmonium may never convince any of them to accompany the faction off-world. </p>

<p>A number of other worlds exist on the distant edges of the system, but these are small and cold, with no inhabitants of note.</p>

<p>(Official versions of the loxoth can be found in the <span style="font-style:italic">Monster Manual II</span>, rheks in the <span style="font-style:italic">Book of Exalted Deeds</span>, and giff in Dragon #339)</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

Much of the ancient magic of the Old Empire was necromantic or depended on vast quantities of human sacrifices, which is why the Harmonium won't allow the native Meterians access to it. </p>

<p>There are also rumors that the magi of the Old Empire had an extremely efficient way to travel between parallel worlds, and the Harmonium wish to discover this magic and exploit it.</p>

<p>Some Anarchists are looking for a copy of the <span style="font-style:italic">Book of Measurements</span>. The Harmonium is looking to stop them at all costs.</p>

<p>They may, on the other hand, end up trying to get it from a lich who was formally the last matriarch of the Traditional Church. The lich has been using the book to ferment jealousy and distruct between Meter and Ortho.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Fjorge is a world inhabited by a race of small industrious insect creatures, called the K'jinte.  The first explorers from the Harmonium where quickly drawn into negotiating between two hives.  Now the Harmonium has brought peace to the world by acting as mediators between the hive-clans.  The K'jinte are a strong industrious race that have taken a natural ease to adapting to the Harmonium way of life individually.  The only problems come from competition between hives as their warriors pheromones will cause them to attack warriors of another hive automatically.  Thus while K'jinte armies are highly efficient the generals of the Harmonium must be careful not to mix warriors from different hives. </p>

<p>Several planar researchers who have studied insect races have noted that the K'jinte and the Thri-Kreen of Athas have similar biology.  The K'jinte however are not adapted to the harsh desert environs that are present on Athas and it is speculated that they might be similar to the Kreen's anscestors before Athas had succumb to desertification.  </p>

<p>The K'jinte have five stages of development: egg, larva, pupa, adult, and enriched adult.  The K'jinte eggs are laid deep in their hives in a Queen's nest and are then taken by caretaker adults to varios egg-chambers in other parts of the nests.  The eggs themselves are oddly undergaurded from an outsider's perspective and the K'jinte are even willing to sell them or eat them in times of famine.  It is almost as if they do not recognize the eggs as their own young at that stage.  The closer an egg gets to actually hatching however the more well guarded it becomes if it is healthy.  Eggs deemed unhealthy or unsuitable are removed and used for food even if they have living larva inside them.</p>

<p>If an egg grows well enough to be allowed to hatch it is brought to the hatchery deep in the most heavily guarded part of the hive.  When a larva hatches it is immediately given the hive-scent and pheromones shared by that hive-clan.  It is a mark that the young k'jinte will carry for the rest of their days and can never be changed, even it appears with strong magic.  Larva are then moved to the near bye larva chambers that surround the hatchery to be fed, and grow.  Larva are all separated into different chambers according to what kind of adult they are to metamorphose into during their pupal stage.  At the end of the larval stage and throughout the pupal stage the larva are specially fed and given pheromones supplemented with secret k'jinte magical spells and incantations, to change their adult forms.  </p>

<p>The pupa are kept for the first four months or so in adjoining chambers to where they were raised as larva.  Once that time is over the pupa either are hatched immediately or they are kept in large chambers stacked one on top of the other warehoused until they are needed.  It takes about three months to change from larva to pupa and another four or more to develop as a pupa to be ready to hatch as an adult.</p>

<p>The adult stage of the K'jinte is for most the final stage in their development.  They have taken on the full adult form that has been shaped to suit the purpose they are needed for in the hive.  However, there is another stage that is sometimes initiated after adulthood through a process called the enrichment.  It is nothing less than a second pupal stage and a new improved adult form and few k'jinte will ever attain it.</p>

<p>The K'jinte hives are built largely according the the materials and landscapes around them.  They are very conscious of the aesthetics of their homes even to the point of sometimes choosing looks over safety.  Perhaps this is because they are the only sentient race on their world as well as the dominant predator.  It often comes as a surprise to outsiders that this "hive" race is so concerned with aesthetics and art, but to the K'jinte their every action is part of a grand work to please their creator gods.  The workers are able to produce a compound that is at first acidic breaking things down before re-hardening.  The warriors and most other casts have a form of this venom diluted and changed for one purpose or another, but it is produced in its greatest amounts by the workers.</p>

<p>More to come, comments welcome as I work and rework this.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>The K'jinte workers look like a centaur-like cross between a beetle and a mantis standing at about waist height to a normal human.  They are able to stand on their hind legs and walk using their four front limbs to manipulate objects.  The second set of arms are less dexterous than their front set and are usually only used for lifting and to hold an object in place while their front most limbs do all the delicate work.  On two legs they are able to walk at a movement rate of 15ft.  On four they can move at 30ft and still use their front limbs for heavy lifting.  When moving long distances they will move on all six limbs at a rate of 35ft.</p>

<p>While they do feel more comfortable operating under a hive mind they are unable to psionically connect to one another without the help of a psionic member of their race, usually a taskmaster or foreman.  Most workers have an extremely limited sense of self and individuality, but it is those few that do develop greater individuality and creativeness are usually chosen to be transformed into a higher form of their species, almost always into a taskmaster, a foreman, an architect, or an engineer.  Until they are chosen for enrichment and transformation the workers advance by character class with the expert being their preferred class.</p>

<p>Acid Spray(ex): When forced to attack or defend themselves workers are able to use their acid spray that is normally used in their construction techniques for an effective attack.  At a maximum range of five feet they are able to spray a jet of acid as a ranged touch attack dealing 1d6+ Con bonus points of acid damage.  A worker is able to do this an number of times a day equal to two plus their total hit dice.</p>

<p>Larger than the workers bustling around them K'jinte warriors spend most of their time on guard nearly motionless or patrolling a perimeter under the command of a taskmaster or officer.  </p>

<p>Like their worker brethren the warriors also aspire to advance and be chosen to be enriched and raised to a higher form.  Usually, this form is to that of the K'jinte Officer or are chosen for transformation into one of the elite fighter forms, but a select few veterans are chosen to become the K'jinte Generals the commanders that lead the armies of the K'jinte into the field and are entrusted with the safety of the great hives.  Otherwise the advancement of the K'jinte Warrior is by character class with their preferred class being fighter.</p>

<p>Venom: On a successful bite attack the victim must make a fortitude save with a difficulty equal to 15 plus the warrior's con bonus or be poisoned, and taking an additional 1d6 damage.  On the next round the second save is made at the same DC to avoid taking another 1d6 damage.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>We've still got a lot of work to do on Ortho proper too - so while colonies are cool too, don't forget to work up ideas for Ortho itself. <img src="http://planewalker.com/sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/wink.png" title="Eye-wink" alt="Eye-wink" class="smiley-content"/> We're getting to the point where need those a *lot* more than we need colonies right now.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I know it's a bit late in the game, but the more I look at the map, the more I think that Area #10 is unviable as a province...I recommend splitting it between Iathra and Motmurk...I would also reconsider the makeup of Areas #3 and #5, splitting them into three instead of two provinces; #5 is larger than the Roman Empire and Alexander's combined...That would still give us seventeen provinces (+Harmony's Glory)...Thoughts???...Also, I really like the idea of the Lycanthropes roving the entirity of the northern Mot and not being confined to a single province...<br />
