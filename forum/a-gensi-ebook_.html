</div> <p>Since it was up on the planescape mail list I thought i would simal cast the idea here for peoples so they can have happiness <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/lol.png" title="Laughing out loud" alt="Laughing out loud" class="smiley-content"/></p>

<p>Ok Dokie so here is what they wanted to put up.</p>

<p>(what they wanted)<br />
Ecology. Eating habits. Life cycle (I love having age tables for things). <br />
Psychology. Anatomy and physiology. Outlook. Culture. </p>

<p>Do genasi make good craftsmen? What do they produce? </p>

<p>What do lightning genasi make from the  vividium found in Lightning? </p>

<p>Do genasi keep pets, and what kind of pets? </p>

<p>How  many geansi does it take to change a light bulb? </p>

<p>Is there any genasi literature? </p>

<p>These are only a few of the questions I'd like answered. And I already have <br />
some potential ideas.... <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/wink.png" title="Eye-wink" alt="Eye-wink" class="smiley-content"/> <br />
(End of what they wanted)</p>

<p>Ok before I go on I would accually like to see some of the talented people around contrubite not fight and bicker with each other like the mail list degenerated into.</p>

<p>Ok Something from me and intro to the book</p>

<p>(If you guys like it that is)</p>

<p>'Though demons and angels have always held a special place in the human heart long before they are considered the mind regards the elements as there primary interest.<br />
Humans seek water and then fire above all else.<br />
The Dwarves seek sheleter in the bowels of the earth.<br />
And the Elves long to breath clean air free of oppression.</p>

<p>Long before we fear the animals around us as children we fear the fires power as it is much more tanable in what it can do, you feel it against your skin before you even approch it, warm and inviting yet it's nature is that of distruction.</p>

<p>We seek out the water as gives us life, some even say that this where we were born from, a raging sea that gave rise to life.<br />
Yet to much and we will drown.</p>

<p>The earth gives us shelter, when the heavens split asunder we seek it's shelter, yet how many of us know of tales of miners lost to it's bowels.</p>

<p>And Air it gives us life above all else so much so that it has bonded us like slaves if we are with out it for mere moments we will die.</p>

<p>Do you see the theme my fellows?<br />
Though each one lets us live, they do so with only a touch for too much of this raw power and we will die or become slave.<br />
For this is the cunning nature of that which sustains us.'</p>

<p>(In the brown quote sections like cut and paste you have seen planescape books you know what I am talking about!)</p>

<p>"Great more fraken wierdos, I remember when we could just sit and have a coffee by oursleves"<br />
A Narzugon commenting on a passing Postive Plane Gensi to a Hound Archon.</p>

<p>(half way down the page)</p>

<p>" 'That' is coffee? "</p>

         <p>What you have provided isn't what "they wanted" answered. Those questions you have quoted were MY questions. You have provided no information from others on the list - just mine. Will you please contribute something from the others on the list?</p>

<p>Also, the list degraded into bickering because 'Galen Musbach' was trying to tell me that Radiance doesn't exist (which it does) and he <span style="font-weight:bold">falsely</span> stated that the Inner Planes were devoid of life, which I proved was incorrect with the proper source materials from the Planescape core.</p>

<p>There are other examples, but that would be anal and my point is clearly made. Radiance and the other para's and quasi's did not magically disappear because Galen wants it to be so, and the Inners' are not "devoid of life".</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Well, I don't really know what mailing list you're talking about nor, to be completely honest, do I care judging from the lovely exchange above.</p>

<p>However, Genasi are cool (well, except for the fire Genasi, I guess). I've actually never heard of any but the four 'pure' elemental Genasi, but I suppose it is only natural that there would be equivalents from the para- and quasi- elemental planes. The energy planes and the plane of vacuum, however, are unlikely to produce such half-breeds. Not too much life exists in those planes to begin with, and that which does is none too friendly with the mortal types.</p>

<p>That brings us, and I use that in the pluralis majestatis, to question where exactly the elemental part of the Genasi comes from. I honestly don't see humans mating with 'pure' elementals (not because I wouldn't put it past them, horny little buggers, breed like rabbits, but because it doesn't seem physically probable). Genies are a likely possibility, as they are 'elemental outsiders', and we all know that many outsiders can interbreed with humans. More and more such planetouched races are being found all the time, from the anal reten.. er.. I mean Lawful Zenythri to the xenophobic Tuladhara. Other potential elemental ancestors of the Genasi are the roughly humanoid elementals such as sylphs and magmen, but the mechanics of that are only slightly less iffy than with pure elementals, particularly in such cases as the latter example. After all, their forms of reproduction are often too different from those of mortals, and are often, as a race, androgynous or monosexual. Then again, the planes are as infinite as hormone-fueled ingenuity, and humans have more fetishes than even the Guvners can hope to list.</p>

<p>Regarding Genasi culture, it would probably have to be divided according to type, since the flighty air Genasi are quite different from the stoic earth Genasi, etc. I'll add my thoughts on the particulars in future posts as I come up with them, but I hope the above helps get things going.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>You said:</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;Caladors&#039;</em> wrote:</div>Ok Dokie so here is what they wanted to put up.</p>

<p>(what they wanted)<br />
Ecology. Eating habits. Life cycle (I love having age tables for things).<br />
Psychology. Anatomy and physiology. Outlook. Culture.</p>

<p>Do genasi make good craftsmen? What do they produce?</p>

<p>What do lightning genasi make from the vividium found in Lightning?</p>

<p>Do genasi keep pets, and what kind of pets?</p>

<p>How many geansi does it take to change a light bulb?</p>

<p>Is there any genasi literature?</p>

<p>These are only a few of the questions I'd like answered. And I already have<br />
some potential ideas.... </div></p>

<p>Starting with 'Ecology', that is <span style="font-weight:bold">word-for-word</span> what I posted to the list. You said my questions were what "they wanted". While it is nice when people agree with you, my personal questions were not the consensus of the group.</p>

<p>In fact, Galen Musbach's response to my email was to make fun of my questions. <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/smile.png" title="Smiling" alt="Smiling" class="smiley-content"/></p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;Caladors&#039;</em> wrote:</div>I said don't let it degenrate into a bickering?
Whats the first thing you did?</div></p>

<p>You seem to be saying that I "started it" by having a greater knowledge of Planescape fauna and cosmology. Galen says the Inner Planes are devoid of life and that Radiance doesn't exist...</p>

<p>Look, if I said "the grass is green" and someone else says "the grass is purple" which statement is correct and which is not?</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;Caladors&#039;</em> wrote:</div>Did you put up the stuff that the other people said?
No</div></p>

<p>Why would I do that? It's your responsibility. You were wanting to bring the discussion to the Planewalker forums; You made the conscious decision to only include one viewpoint and present it as the group's consensus.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;Caladors&#039;</em> wrote:</div>You decided that you were the moral guardain of a Planescape Mail Thread.</div></p>

<p>It's not being the "moral guardian" by insisting that what actually exists actually exists...</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;Caladors&#039;</em> wrote:</div>Did you just read those words?
Grow up!</div></p>

<p>Nice. Very mature of <span style="font-weight:bold">you</span> <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/smile.png" title="Smiling" alt="Smiling" class="smiley-content"/></p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;Caladors&#039;</em> wrote:</div>If your not adding something here then what are you doing?
Your taking away.</div></p>

<p>What I'm trying to add is your ability to present other material from the list besides what I posted. You're acting like someone who was caught plagiarising.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;Caladors&#039;</em> wrote:</div>Jesus you try and kick start some life into somehting and this is the repayment?</div></p>

<p>How about you don't lie? That's exactly what you did. All I asked is that you provide something in addition to my words.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;Caladors&#039;</em> wrote:</div>How about you do something instead of whine!</p>

<p>What a joke.</div></p>

<p>Caladors, if you're hearing a whining sound I suggest you either let your dog in, OR put a hand under your chin and press firmly upwards.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

That brings us, and I use that in the pluralis majestatis, to question where exactly the elemental part of the Genasi comes from.</div></p>

<p>From the <span style="font-style:italic">Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting</span> (yes I know this is Planescape but still any info is good info!)</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Genasi</span> (pg. 19)<br />
<div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Genasi are descended from the elemental-related creatures, such as efreet, dao, djinn, jann, and marids, among others.</div></p>

<p>OK, so the "among others" could mean one of two things. Either, other creatures representing the same four elements already listed <span style="font-style:italic">or</span> creatures from other elemental environments (quasi- and para-). I like the second interpretation in that it opens the doors wide for quasi- and para- genasi.</p>

<p>Also, I would suppose that the jann, being a combination of all four elements, could produce a genasi offspring that represented any one of those elements. Just as gender is determined randomly, so could the type of genasi produced by a coupling with a janni be random.</p>

         <p>No I have no responcability to a forum thread, do think about what you write before you write it?<br />
Your complaining that they made fun of your questions in the mail list so you thought the best action would be to have a go at someone whom trys to get it going in a serious manor?<br />
Right this makes sense how.</p>

<p>I don't need this I'm not even DM games at the moment!<br />
Why should I have to pander to the needs of some inscure child?</p>

<p>Maybe with any luck clueless will come in here and 'kick over' this idea.</p>

<p>Hey guys I tried.<br />
I tried to kick start getting some new content in here with fresh ideas.<br />
But it appers that is not what you want.</p>

I'd like to see some kind of dragon disciple type prestige class, where a genasi gets special powers depending on the type of element they are associated with. Like "Elemental Disciple" or "Disciple of the Inner Planes" or something.</p>

<p>Also, I was thinking that another origin of genasi could be offspring of the mephlings from <span style="font-style:italic">Planar Handbook</span> (pgs. 10 &amp; 11).</p>

         <p>If anyone's interested, here's a prestige class I knocked together this afternoon after reading this thread. Given, it's pretty rough, but it's a start. Read it over and see what you think.</p>

<p>Genasi Embraced</p>

<p>	Many Genasi go through life without much understanding of their ancestry or even the curiosity to find out. Others find that they cannot ignore the call of their blood and do all they can to embrace this inner strength. Through a long process of study, meditation, and experience the most dedicated Genasi sometimes manage to awaken this strength and bring to the surface the inheritance of their blood.<br />
HD: d8</p>

<p>Class Skills: Craft, Concentration, Gather Information, Knowledge (Arcana), Knowledge (The Planes), Listen, Planar Expertise, Profession, Search, Spot, Survival, Plus 2 others that depend on the Genasi type:</p>

<p>	Air: Balance, Tumble<br />
	Ash: Hide, Swim<br />
	Dust: Bluff, Move Silently<br />
	Earth: Climb, Intimidate<br />
	Fire: Jump, Tumble<br />
	Ice: Balance, Climb<br />
	Lightning: Perform, Tumble<br />
	Magma: Intimidate, Swim<br />
	Mineral: Climb, Knowledge (Architecture and Engineering)<br />
	Negative: Bluff, Intimidate<br />
	Ooze: Escape Artist, Swim<br />
	Positive: Heal, Perform<br />
	Radiance: Perform, Tumble<br />
	Salt: Climb, Jump<br />
	Smoke: Hide, Intimidate<br />
	Steam: Diplomacy, Escape Artist<br />
	Vacuum: Hide, Move Silently<br />
	Water: Escape Artist, Swim</p>

<p>Skill points at each level: 2 + Int modifier</p>

<p>Requirements:<br />
Level: 5th or higher<br />
Race: Any Genasi<br />
Skills: Knowledge (The Planes) 4 ranks (Plus specialty in your associated plane), the appropriate associated Language <br />
Must have visited the para/quasi/elemental/energy plane associated with your Genasi Variety</p>

<p>Genasi Embraced have one good save and 2 bad saves. The good save depends on the Genasi variety:<br />
Fortitude: Ash, Earth, Ice, Magma, Mineral, Negative, Ooze, Salt, Water<br />
Reflex: Air, Dust, Fire, Lightning, Positive, Radiance, Smoke, Steam, Vacuum</p>

<p>Lvl      Bab     Good     BadSpecial<br />
1st       +0       +2      +0           Elemental Affinity, Elemental Prestige<br />
2nd      +1       +3      +0           Increased Resistance<br />
3rd      +2       +3       +1           Body of the Element, Elemental Physiology<br />
4th      +3       +4       +1           Mind of the Element<br />
5th      +3       +4       +1           Soul of the Element</p>

<p>Class Features<br />
Weapon and Armor proficiency: Genasi Embraced do not gain any additional proficiency with weapons or armor</p>

<p>Elemental Affinity: As a creature on its way to embracing its ancestry, you are beginning to heighten your inherent powers. If you have any special attacks or abilities due to your race, the DC is increased by 1 for each level of Genasi Embraced that you take.</p>

<p>Elemental Prestige: Creatures from the Inner planes are beginning to notice your devotion. Toward beings native to your Inner plane and all adjacent Inner planes, you gain a +2 bonus to Charisma related skills, and they start as one Attitude level higher than usual. Towards beings native to the opposed Inner plane and all adjacent Inner planes, you have a -2 penalty to Charisma related skills, and they start as one attitude level lower than usual.</p>

<p>Increased Resistance: You have awakened your inner spark of power, and can now shrug off all but the worst punishment of your element. Your inherent resistance to the elements increases by 5. If you have more than one resistance, choose one and it increases by 5.</p>

<p>Body of the Element: Through study, meditation, and exposure, you have attuned yourself to your plane of ancestry. You no longer suffer from any of the inherent dangers of that particular plane. Note that while this will make you immune to the fire damage of the plane of Fire or the cold damage of the plane of Ice, it does not make you immune to additional damage of that type suffered while on the plane. This ability necessarily only functions on that plane.</p>

<p>Elemental Physiology: Your body is beginning to adapt to Inner planar life, and is becoming more durable. You have a 50% chance to ignore critical hits. This increases by 25% at 4th lvl and again at 5th lvl. You also gain a +2 bonus to any saves against poison, paralysis or stunning.</p>

<p>Mind of the Elements: Your mind is beginning to fall into the patterns more commonly associated with Elemental. You no longer need to sleep and are immune to all sleep effects. Additionally, you are no longer considered a humanoid for the purposes of spells like Charm Person.</p>

<p>Soul of the Elements: You have become one with your ancestry, for now and all time. You are for all intents and purposes an Inner planar being. Your type changes to Elemental. Your inherent resistance increases by another 5. You gain immunity to Poison, Paralysis, and Stunning, but can no longer be brought back from the dead by any magic less powerful than limited wish, wish, miracle, or true resurrection or any spell that specifically returns life to elementals or outsiders.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Dragon #314 has prestige classes based on each of the four basic elements, but they are mostly tied in with some of the elemental-themed organizations also described therein. Making prestige classes for Genasi would probably entail making Genasi organizations as well, or at least that is how I understand prestige classes. Really, in my opinion, only about one of ten prestige classes that I have seen published are original enough to be worth the effort and I prefer to stick with the core classes unless the PC is really intent on specializing and joins a fitting group to learn the 'hidden art'. However, the one for all idea of a genasi specific prestige class I like. Rather than making one for each type and having the entire idea become stale, it becomes more of a bonding to your inner nature deal.</p>

<p>Mephlings, howeverk, I dislike. They are one of many attempts to turn otherwise high Level Adjustment monsters into viable player character races by weakening them without losing too much flavor. Having the most generic background description possible, either the interbreeding of humans and mephits (and here I didn't think that would be possible) or a wizard's creation gone awry, they are so quotidian that I simply ignore them completely. I suggest sticking with either genie-kin or simply plane-touched origins for Genasi.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

          Genasi        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>the idea of a genasi book began long ago in the early days of 3e, after planewalker was granted permission to be the official planescape fan site, and to develop new material for the setting.<br />
I volunteered to work on that book, along with several others, but the group just faded away. But i did manage to write down some ideas, and even start developing them. Now, by no means are these ideas complete, or even balanced, as i haven't had a chance to look over them closely again since i wrote them, but here are the things i wrote, which could be a bit long.</p>

<p>Who knows, if this helps spark the fires of creation again i'll know i've done my share.</p>

<p>Prestige Classes</p>

<p> <br />
Here are some ideas for prestige classes I've had. The names probably need a rethinking.</p>

<p>Elemental Child – A PrC that allows the genasi to become a half elemental.<br />
Scion of the Whirlpool – A Water genasi that can command the waves, and is extremely effective against ships and aquatic creatures.<br />
Scion of the Iceberg – An ice genasi that command cold and ice.<br />
Fantastic Builder – A PrC that can pump more from the stone shape and wall of stone spells, enabling him to build faster. He also makes use of elementals, both as combatants, and to help him build.<br />
Wind Weaver – Allows air genasi to change, divert, or dispel winds.<br />
Water Giver – a water genasi that can create water out of thin air. He can control the rate at which the water is created, from a small dribble, to a geyser of water.<br />

<p>Fort Wizard</p>

<p> <br />
Forts, castles, and other buildings are usually sturdy things that can withstand many attacks, unless you count magic. Many such a place as fallen before the might of a powerful spellcaster, or of several spellcasters working together. This has lead many a lord to hire spellcasters of his own to launch their own attack spells at the assailant<br />
Earth Genasi spellcasters, both arcane and divine, with their special connection to earth and stone, sometimes learn to use their magical abilities to augment the power of castles, believing that such great works of stone are a testament to the power of their element. Some of them learn, over time, how to imbue stone and metal buildings with their spells temporarily, and how to treat damage done to structures. While they neglect some of their advancement in their spellcasting ability their abilities make them the ideal defenders of castles. <br />
Clerics and wizards are the most numerous to take up this mantle. Sorcerers, with their limited spell selection are not usually drawn to this path, and druids even less so.<br />

Wind. When it is gentle and caressing it feels great, but when its speed increases and it brings with it dust, cold or heat it becomes annoying, but should its speed increase further, becoming a storm, it becomes very destructive. And such is the fascination of some air genasi that they seek to master this destructive nature of their element, learning to unleash the storm in all its fury.<br />
Druids, wizards, sorcerers and clerics can take this class, though wizards are somewhat less common.<br />
Hit Dice: d6</p>

<p>Prerequisites:<br />
Race: Air Genasi<br />
Intimidate: 4 ranks<br />
Knowledge (Nature, Religion or Arcana): 8 ranks<br />
Spellcasting: Ability to cast two of the following spells: Shocking Grasp, Resist Elements, Wind Wall, Call Lightning, Gust of Wind.</p>

<p>Class Skills<br />
The scion of the storm's class skills (and their relevant abilities) are:<br />
Alchemy (Int), Concentration (Con), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (Arcana) (Int), Knowledge (Religion) (Int), Knowledge (Nature) (Int), Spellcraft (Int).<br />
See Chapter 4: Skills in the Player’s Handbook for skill descriptions.<br />
Skill points at each level: 2 + Int modifier</p>

<p>Class Features<br />
All of the following are class features for the scion of the storm.<br />
Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: The scion of the storm does not gain any new weapon, armor or shield proficiencies.<br />
Shocking Touch: A 1st level storm scion can inflict 1d4 points of damage with touch. This is a free action to activate and does not draw attacks of opportunity. When using this ability he is considered armed, and need only make a touch attack to hit.<br />
The damage is increased to 1d6 at 4th level, 1d8 at 7th level, and 2d6 at 10th level.<br />
Conducting Body: At 2nd level the blaze scion gains lightning resistance 5. His lightning resistance increases by 5 at 5th, and 8th level., until he reaches lightning resistance 15 at 8th level.<br />
Call the Wind: A 3rd level scion of the storm can use his knowledge of the winds to create a sudden burst of wind in front of him. This effect acts similar to the Gust of Wind spell, except that it carries with it the shocking touch of the storm scion. Any creature caught within the area of this effect suffers damage as if the scion of the storm has touched him. <br />
This ability can be used a number of times per day equal to 3 + the scion of the storm's Cha modifier. The effect is like a spell cast by a sorcerer of the scion's class level.<br />
Eye of the Storm: At 6th level he has learned to master the winds enough that he can move through the strongest winds unhindered.<br />
Call the Gale: At 7th level the scion of the storm can create an effect similar to the Control Winds spells, except for the following changes:<br />
•	He can only increase the speed of the wind when using this ability.<br />
•	He can increase the wind force by one level of strength for every two levels.<br />
•	This ability acts as if cast by a spellcaster of twice his class level.<br />
•	On the first round of this effect, and every 10 minutes latter a burst of lightning races through the area of effect, dealing the same damage as that done by the storm scion's shocking tough ability.<br />
This ability uses two of his Call the Wind uses.<br />
Call the Storm: At 10th level his mastery of the storm is such that he can call a storm into being.<br />

It is common knowledge that spellcasters can create golems and summon elemental creatures. But it is less known that in the creation of a golem the spellcasters use a spirit from the elemental plane of earth. An even less known fact is that the clerics can create only a few kinds of golems, whereas the arcane spellcasters have a more broad selection. <br />
Those clerics whose heritage can be traced back to this plane can sacrifice their advancement in magic with the abilities to create elementals from the rocks around them, to gain some measure of command on golems, and to learn an alternate way to create other kinds of golems, besides the clay golem.<br />
Hit Dice: d8</p>

<p>Prerequisites:<br />
Race: Earth Genasi<br />
Knowledge (the Planes): 14 ranks<br />
Knowledge (Religion): 14 ranks<br />
Spellcasting: Ability to cast Animate Objects, and have the Earth domain.</p>

<p>Class Skills<br />
The Stone Rouser's class skills (and their relevant abilities) are:<br />
Climb (Str), Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Knowledge (the Planes) (Int), Knowledge (Religion) (Int), Spellcarft (Int).<br />
See Chapter 4: Skills in the Player’s Handbook for skill descriptions.<br />
Skill points at each level: 2 + Int modifier</p>

<p>Class Features<br />
All of the following are class features for the stone rouser.<br />
Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: The stone rouser gains proficiency in warhammer, light hammer, handaxe, battleaxe, and greataxe. He gains no new armor or shield proficiency.<br />
Rouse the Rock: When using the Animate Objects spell on stone the stone rouser can choose to infuse it with a spirit from the plane of earth, giving it statistics of an elemental. Use of this ability counts as two uses of his ability to command earth elementals.<br />
At first level the elemental has the same statistics as a huge earth elemental. When he reaches 3rd level he can use it to call a greater earth elemental.<br />
Touch the Stone Spirit: When a stone rouser gains 2nd level he can try to command a golem. This ability is a new use for his command earth elementals ability.  <br />
Rouse the Stone Spirit: By the time the stone rouser has gained 5th level his knowledge of stone and earth is such that golems are treated as having 4 HD less for all purposes of commanding them. So a Stone Golem (14 HD) counts as having only 10 HD for the purpose of rebuking and commanding, and if the stone rouser manages to command one it only counts as 10 HD for the purpose of determining how many HD the stone rouser is commanding, so he can command two such golems at the same time.<br />

There are few people who are unaware of the stories about the great strength and toughness of a barbarian, especially when he enters his famous rage. While they usually consider themselves better than other races, even the genasi can sometimes be found to have the barbarian class. But while all barbarians find ways to let their inner rage empower them some of the genasi barbarians have discovered a deeper truth: through their rage they can unleash their elemental nature and let it empower them, alongside the bonuses they are granted from their rage. At the same time they also gain a small measure of defense against their element.<br />
But while all elemental ragers are grouped here under one prestige class they are in fact different from one another. Air genasi who take this class focus on their speed, reaction, and evasive tactics. Earth genasi focus more on making themselves more resilient to attacks against their body, to climb better, and to remain standing. Fire gensai prefer to move from place to place, but they value their strength, and their ability to grab a hold on their enemies. Water genasi disdain the more physical aspects of the other genasi, improving their mind, their resistance to effects on the mind, but at the same time they also learn to improve their ability to move against the flow.<br />
A genasi who takes this class always becomes an elemental rager of his element, so an air genasi who takes this class cannot decide to be a fire rager, even if he fulfils the prerequisites.<br />
Hit Dice: d12</p>

<p>Prerequisites:<br />
Race: Genasi<br />
Alignment: Any non Lawful.<br />
Knowledge (the Planes): 4 ranks<br />
Intimidate: 9 ranks<br />
Wilderness Lore: 9 ranks<br />
Feats: 2 feats from the relevant list<br />
Air – Improved Initiative, Lightning Reflexes, Mounted Combat, Run, Dodge, Skill Focus (Ride)<br />
Earth – Great Fortitude, Skill Focus (Climb), Toughness, Armor Proficiency (Heavy)<br />
Fire – Great Fortitude, Power Attack, Skill Focus (Jump), Cleave<br />
Water – Iron Will, Skill Focus (Swim), Power attack, Improved Bull Rush<br />
Special: Ability to rage at least twice per day.</p>

<p>Class Skills<br />
The elemental rager's class skills (and their relevant abilities) are:<br />
Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Intimidate (Cha), Intuit Direction (Wis), Jump (Str), Listen (Wis), Ride (Dex), Swim (Str), Wilderness Lore (Wis).<br />
See Chapter 4: Skills in the Player’s Handbook for skill descriptions.<br />
Skill points at each level: 2 + Int modifier</p>

<p>Class Features<br />
All of the following are class features for the elemental rager.<br />
Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: the scion of the blaze does not receive any new weapon or armor proficiencies.<br />
Elemental Resistance: At 1st level the elemental rager has gained a slight resistance to his native element. He suffers 5 points of damage less from such attacks. This increases to 10 points at 5th level, and 15 points at 9th level.  An air genasi gains this resistance against lightning, an earth genasi against acid, a fire genasi against fire, and a water genasi gains it against cold.<br />
Elemental Rage: At 2nd level the character can enter a rage that manifests his elemental heritage. It provides him with all the benefits of a normal rage, but he is surrounded by an elemental aura that causes damage to anyone who attacks him, or is attacked by him. This aura is quite weak at first, but grows more powerful as he gains levels. At 2nd level the aura causes an extra 1d6 points of damage. This damage increases to 1d8 at 6th level, and to 1d10 at 10th level. If the elemental rager has a critical hit on an opponent this damage is not multiplied.<br />
This damage is of elemental nature, so an air genasi would cause lightning damage, an earth genasi would cause acid damage, a fire genasi would cause fire damage, and a water genasi would cause cold damage. <br />
When the elemental rager is 6th level he can use this rage twice per day, and when reaching 10th level can sue it three times per day.<br />
Elemental Power: At levels 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 7th, 8th, and 9th an elemental rager chooses a power from the following list, depending on his element:</p>

<p>Air:<br />
1.	+10' to land speed. This power can be taken twice, adding a total of +20' to the elemental rager's movement speed.<br />
2.	+1 competence bonus to initiative. This power can be taken up to 4 times, with the bonuses stacking each time.<br />
3.	+1 bonus to Dexterity score. This power can be taken a twice for a total bonus of +2.<br />
4.	+1 dodge bonus to AC. This power can be taken a maximum of 3 times.<br />
5.	+1 bonus to Reflex saves. This power can be taken twice for a maximum bonus of +2.<br />
6.	+2 competence bonus to Ride skill. This power can be taken a maximum of three times. If taken twice the bonus increases from +2 to +5, and if taken three times the bonus jumps to +10.</p>

<p>Earth:<br />
1.	+1 natural armor bonus. This power can be taken three times, for a total bonus of +3. This bonus stacks with current natural armor bonuses.<br />
2.	+4 stability bonus against bull rush. This power cannot be taken more than once.<br />
3.	+1 bonus to Constitution score. This power can be taken a twice for a total bonus of +2.<br />
4.	1/- damage reduction. This ability can be taken up to four times, for a maximum total of 4/-. This damage reduction stacks only with a damage reduction granted by the barbarian class ability.<br />
5.	+1 bonus to Fortitude saves. This power can be taken twice for a maximum bonus of +2.<br />
6.	+2 competence bonus to Climb skill. This power can be taken a maximum of three times. If taken twice the bonus increases from +2 to +5, and if taken three times the bonus jumps to +10.</p>

<p>Fire:<br />
1.	10% miss chance. This power can only be taken once. <br />
2.	+1 competence bonus to Grappling. This power can be taken up to three times, with the bonuses stacking each time.<br />
3.	+1 bonus to Strength score. This power can be taken a twice for a total bonus of +2.<br />
4.	+1 bonus to Fortitude saves. This power can be taken twice for a maximum bonus of +2.<br />
5.	+2 competence bonus to Jump skill. This power can be taken a maximum of three times. If taken twice the bonus increases from +2 to +5, and if taken three times the bonus jumps to +10.</p>

<p>Water:<br />
1.	+10' to swim speed. This power can be taken twice, adding a total of +20' to the elemental rager's movement speed.<br />
2.	+4 competence bonus to perform bull rush.<br />
3.	+1 bonus to Wisdom score. This power can be taken a twice for a total bonus of +2.<br />
4.	+1 bonus to Will saves. This power can be taken twice for a maximum bonus of +2.<br />

A descendant of a creature from the elemental plane of fire these genasi can take easily to the violent nature of their element.  Those fire genasi who embrace their violent side usually follow the path of the evoker, fighter, or barbarian, as these better allow them to spread violence. But a rare few go even beyond that. Combining their knowledge of magic with a fascination with fire they seek to find a deeper connection within them to the flame that they believe is inherent in anything, but their violent and destructive side channels this connection to ignite that flame ever higher, leaving behind them a path of ashes and burned husks.<br />
While the genasi believe that this is due to the fire inherent in anything most scholars scoff at this and offer the theory that they become something like a living gate to the plane of fire, able to channel a growing amount of fire energy through their bodies. <br />
Most of those who follow this path are sorcerers or wizards, although priests are not unknown amongst them. Due to the destructive nature of this class almost everyone is of evil bent.<br />

<p>Class Features<br />
All of the following are class features for the scion of the blaze.<br />
Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: the scion of the blaze does not receive any new weapon or armor proficiencies.<br />
Warm Touch: A 1st level blaze scion can inflict 1d4 points of damage with touch. This is a free action to activate and does not draw attacks of opportunity. When using this ability he is considered armed, and need only make a touch attack to hit.<br />
As a side effect this prevents him from delivering cold-based touch attacks, like chill touch, but doubles the damage he does when casting burning hands. <br />
The damage is increased to 1d6 at 4th level, 1d8 at 7th level, and 2d6 at 10th level.<br />
Warm Body: At 2nd level the blaze scion gains fire resistance 5. His fire resistance increases by 5 at 4th, 6th and 8th level., until he reaches fire resistance 20 at 8th level.<br />
Awaken the Flame: At 3rd level the blaze scion is able to extend his Warm Touch ability and use it from afar, like a ranged touch attack. The range for this ability is 10' per level. <br />
The blaze scion must wait 1d4 rounds before he can use this power again after each use.<br />
Awaken the Fires: Upon reaching 5th level the blaze scion can choose to target a number of objects up to twice his level and affect them with his Awaken the Flame power. The damage from this power disregards the objects' hardness.<br />
This power can be used a number of times per day equal to 3 + the blaze scion's Cha modifier.<br />
Awaken the Conflagration: At 7th level the blaze scion can choose to half the distance of his awaken the flame ability and surround one target in intense flames, causing him 1d6 points of damage per class level. The target gets a reflex save for half damage, with a DC of 15 + scion's Cha modifier.<br />
To use this power he must spend two uses of his Awaken the Fires power.<br />
Awaken the Blaze Within: at 10th level the scion gains the ability to manifest intense flames around his body to a radius of 10' once per day. These flames cause 5d6 points of fire damage to any creature that enters the area, and they last for 10 minutes. When this power is manifest he becomes immune to fire attacks and gains cold resistance 50. After absorbing 100 points of cold damage the power of the blaze is spent and cannot be reactivated that day.<br />
After this power is exhausted the blaze scion becomes fatigued for the next 12 hours.<br />

<p> <br />
The descendants of earth have a strong affinity to its rhythm, but some of them hear a powerful rumble from deep within the earth. The rumble of an earthquake waiting to happen, and the building of a pressure that is just waiting to erupt is drawing them like moths to a flame. <br />
Unlike the Scions of the Blaze, they seek a connection to their destructive power through divine means. Most of the members of the trembling earth are clerics or druids, though some rangers are known to take part in this. In order to reach their power to the earth they first seek to draw the earth into themselves and focus its power outside themselves.<br />
Some people refer to them as the Tremblers, though never to their face, as they seem to dislike the name.<br />

<p>Class Features<br />
All of the following are class features for the scion of the trembling earth.<br />
Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: the scion of the blaze does not receive any new weapon or armor proficiencies.<br />
Touch of Trembling:  A 1st level trembler can cause objects to become brittle with a touch attack. This reduces the hardness of an object by half, for the next 1d4 minutes. This ability can affect an object only once per day. Use of this ability is a free action, and the object to be affected must be touched.<br />
Vibrant Body: At 2nd level the trembler manifests the touch of trembling ability even whenever he comes in contact with an object, even if the object was used to strike at him. <br />
Cone of Quivering: A 4th level trembler is able to focus his power outside and manifest it as a cone of vibrations that extends for 5' per level, and causes 1d10 points of damage to every creature and object. Disregard an object's hardness against this power.<br />
The trembler must wait 1d4 rounds before he can use this power again after each use.<br />
Call the Trembling: A 6th level trembler is able to finally focus his power into the earth, creating a minor quake. This affects a 10' radius, causing all creatures within the area to make a Reflex save (DC 14 + Wis modifier) or be knocked down. This has a close range (25ft. + 5ft./2 levels) and can be used a number of times per day equal to 3 + the trembler's Cha modifier.<br />
Eruption: When the trembler reaches 8th level he can cause the earth to erupt. This power affects a radius of 20' and causes all creatures within area 4d6 points of impact damage. They must also make a Reflex save (DC 16 + Wis Modifier) or be knocked prone. This ability can be made manifest anywhere within 200 ft. This ability uses 2 uses of the trembler's call the trembling uses.<br />
Call the Great Trembling: At 10th level the trembler can call upon the earth to create an earthquake. This ability acts as if cast by a cleric whose level equals the trembler's character level. He can call upon this power only once per day.<br />

<p> <br />
Those born with an ancestor from the plane of Air are born with the ability to “mingle with the air” (levitate). For many of them this is a nice addition to their prowess, but some seek to go beyond it, and gain more mastery of their heritage – they seek to claim their birthright – the skies.<br />
These people search inside themselves the seeds for their power and nurture them to their fullest potential, showing an amazing array of abilities that aid them in many fields.<br />
This is not an easy path, but the rewards are marvelous. To pursue this path they must concentrate only on this, and any side step will cause them to never again be able to advance in this class. So a fighter/rogue who takes this class cannot advance his rogue or fighter levels until he as finished rising the 10 levels of this class, and if he does take a level in any class but this he cannot advance in this class anymore, though he retains the abilities gained.<br />

See Chapter 4: Skills in the Player’s Handbook for skill descriptions.<br />
Skill Points at Each Additional Level: 2 + Int modifier.<br />
Class Features<br />
All of the following are class features of the follower of the breeze.<br />
Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Followers of the breeze are proficient with all ranged weapons, even the exotic ones. They are proficient only in light armor. When wearing heavier armors they cannot perform many of their class features.<br />
Nimbleness (Su): Followers of the breeze can use their Dexterity modifier to their Jump and Climb skills instead of Strength, and they gain a +2 competence bonus to their Balance, and Jump skills. At 5th level this bonus increases to +5, and at 9th level it becomes +10.<br />
Fast Movement (Ex): A follower of the breeze moves faster than normal speed, gaining a +10’ to its movement rate at 1st level. The movement rate increases by another 10’ at 5th and 9th levels, for a total of +30’ to their movement rate at 9th level.<br />
Leap of the Clouds (Su): At 2nd level, a follower of the breeze’s jumping distance (vertical or horizontal) is not limited according to her height.<br />
Blend with the Air (Sp): At 3rd level a follower of the breeze has mastered his Mingle with the Air racial ability to such a degree that he can use it once per day per follower of the breeze level. In addition she can use Free Fall on herself at will.<br />
Hurl the Wind (Sp): At 6th level a follower of the breeze has learned to use the power of the wind somewhat offensively, and is able to generate an effect similar to Gust of Wind three times per day. This effect is treated as if cast by a sorcerer of a level equal to the follower of the breeze class level.<br />
Merge with Air (Sp): At 8th level a follower of the breeze has gained enough mastery over her heritage that she can move more freely in the air. Once per day she can move through the air as if a Fly spell was cast on her. Treat this as if a sorcerer of her class level cast it.<br />
One with the Wind (Sp): At 10th level the follower of the breeze has reached such a deep understanding of her heritage that she becomes an elemental creature. Her type changes to “elemental”, which means (among other things) that she is no longer affected by spells that specifically target humanoids, such as charm person. She gains an elemental creature’s immunity to poison, sleep, paralysis, and stunning and is no longer subject to critical hits or flanking.<br />
She gains the speed and movement modes, and special attacks of a medium air elemental, as noted in the Monster Manual, except that the save DC against her whirlwind attack is 15 + Constitution modifier.<br />
Upon achieving this state the follower of the breeze’s appearance undergoes a minor physical change, and it seems that there is always a soft breeze around her, moving her hair and clothes. <br />
This state of being is not without cost. She can now be hedged out by the use of a magic circle spell against her alignment, and there are other spells that target elementals. In addition, she suffers double damage from any spell that deals earth damage (like Magic Stone, Spike Stones, etc.).<br />

<p>The Scions of Destruction<br />
 <br />
This organization draws to itself genasi and teaches them to heed their inner urges of destruction through special training. This organization is actually a group of organizations, each for every genasi type, that seek to bring destruction wherever they go. <br />
Most of the members of this organization are of an evil bent, giving them a dark reputation. They are always eager to lend the services of members for the right price, and their reputation of destruction is such that there are those willing to pay their price.<br />
While not a few of its members are those with the various Scion PrCs the members are not drawn exclusively from them, and elemental ragers, and other PrCs can also be found among its members.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">
