</div> <p>Just to be clear, the point is to discuss and politely argue about these points. They aren't commandments or top down lecturing, just things people notice that seem off.</p>

<p>1) Nature of Infinity: Alright, this is the big one, so I figure we might as well mention it first:</p>

<p>Infinite numbers of beings fighting over infinite spaces doesn't make sense from a logical perspective. </p>

<p>Infinite elemental planes means no elemental should be worried about resource depletion.</p>

<p>I usually don't worry about this, but I remember on the WotC boards the solution to avoiding a lot of logical flaws was to say the planes are infinitely expanding, rather than outright infinite.</p>

<p>The other thing to note, because it's a fantasy, is that wars and stealing minerals can change the nature of the infinite. So it's not the missing gold that's the problem it's the corrosion of what Elemental Earth is that matters.</p>

<p>2) Our world is the center of all things: This is a problem when you have infinite planes filled with infinite beings competing over a finite space. Worse when you state that all the planars know how important this single world is.</p>

<p>Why would exemplars bother fighting anywhere but the mortal world on which creation rests?</p>

<p>I understand the world may be hard to access, but the problem is there's little point in doing much else <em>but</em> figuring out a way to influence this one world.</p>       </div>

<p>Maybe it's more like an Excel file.  You can scroll downward infinitely, but it takes longer and longer to go down, and it's always easy to go back up to the top.  That would keep all the activity more or less localized in the main areas, but you could always push deeper.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Not necessarily.  The physical space of a given plane may be infinite, but it doesn't necessarily follow that a given resource is equally infinite.  For all we know, there may be an infinite variety of finite resources.  Maybe once all the, say, gold in Earth and Mineral are mined out, Prime sources of it dry up as well.  And there's nothing to say that this resource depletion hasn't happened before.  (Whatever *did* happen to all that oricalcum?)  This could provide a good excuse/reason for legendary materials that simply aren't available any longer.</p>

         <p>Petitioners are probably infinite, but they're more like set dressing, more interested in living in tune with the plane/their alignment/their power, than with any inter-planar plots or mechanations.  Plus, their numbers are in constant flux, with new ones arriving all the time and probably a similar number that are merging with their plane/power.  This would keep even a finite plane from being overrun.</p>

<p>Also, I don't recall ever reading that the number of exemplars are infinite.  Countless maybe, but never infinite.  And for groups like the Gehreleths, they're explicitly said to have finite numbers.</p>

<p>I suspect that the planes are <span style="font-style:italic">functionally</span> infinite, without ever needing to define the scope of that infinity (like in my Excel file example). So when dealing with the problem of infinities in a setting like this, I go with this idea of "There's always something more".</p>

<p>I don't know if it would draw on the psyche of the creator.  The Outer Planes at least are aligned, so how would it draw on the psyche of somebody whose alignment didn't mesh with the plane?  </p>

         <p>I really like the Excel file metaphor for this. It's the perfect explanation.</p>

<p>As far as issue #2 goes, I feel like this has been a problem within the Planescape literature as a whole. Prime worlds are explicitly backwater, uneducated, and pointless (or at least they're treated that way). But also they're explicitly important somehow. But they can't be important, because they're not getting constantly invaded by needlessly large armies of celestials and demons.</p>

<p>I'm not really sure how to resolve this issue. If they're unimportant then it's kind of silly and there's little point in even having them in the first place, but if they're extremely important then people need to be fighting over them <span style="font-weight:bold">way</span> more than is happening in literature.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>Wicke</em> wrote:</div>Maybe it's more like an Excel file.  You can scroll downward infinitely, but it takes longer and longer to go down, and it's always easy to go back up to the top.  That would keep all the activity more or less localized in the main areas, but you could always push deeper.</div></p>

<p>This is great. I've been thinking about something that may connect with this. Both the infinite and infinitely-expanding models seem to imply a frontier, a point at which settlement stops and then there is simply vastness. But the outer planes are so based on belief that the mood of a town can relocate it to another plane entirely, in which case all of this empty space doesn't really make sense.</p>

<p>Maybe I'm just restating Wicke's Excel metaphor, but what if the planes (at least the outer planes) are simply as big as they need to be? And it might take some serious quantity of belief to actually create new real estate. A party of adventurers could walk for years into virgin territory and it would never take more than several days to get back, simply because they aren't creating new space despite what they're experiencing. </p>

<p>Maybe this whole thing calls for a Cosmology Renovation Project. Obviously this isn't the Far Realms - the planes have direction and landscape and generally make experiential sense. That said, perhaps they're not at all "normal" 3D spaces on the macro scale, which is where a lot of these paradoxes seem to come from.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I am bothered by the fact that Gehennan real estate (the mounts themselves) is not infinite.  Given the exploitative nature of yugoloths, every possible resource in the Infernal Mounts (iron, valuable stones, and so on) would have been totally mined out ages ago, which would certainly not be any good for the loths, since all of their competitors are sitting on infinite planes.</p>

<p>If I were designing Gehenna, I might have the surface of the Infernal Mounts be finite, but the interior of each of the mounts would be infinite.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Here's my take on the second point:</p>

<p>What is the relationship between the Outer Planes and the Prime Material?  What about the Prime to the Inner Planes?  Or the Astral or the Ethereal?  Hyena of Ice wrote this in the Positive Energy Plane Renovation thread: "The planes were... created (came into being) in this order: Ethereal, Elemental, Astral, Prime, Outer."  That means we have pure creation (spiritual or metaphysical), followed by the building blocks of the 'verse (physical matter), followed by the genesis of thought (the mind), followed by the Prime (our home), followed by the Outer Planes (thought given form).</p>

<p>This suggests that the Outer Planes are entirely dependent on the continued existence of every other plane.</p>

<p>My next question is this: What are the gods?  What is their relationship with mortals?  Or the Prime?  Why do they have followers?  My answer is to define the relationship between the worshipper and the object of worship.  Gods gain their power from their worshippers.  When a god is no longer worshipped, it "dies."  But why is that?  What is so special about the act of worshipping that it powers and sustains a being as powerful as a god?  I see worship as a form of energy.  It's a very special type of energy, and it's something that only gods can tap into.</p>

<p>So gods derive power from worship.  The more followers they have, the more powerful they become.</p>

<p>From this, I derive two reasons for the Outer Plane inhabitants to be so concerned with the Prime Material.  1) It's the source of mortal worship.  The more territory a god can influence (through his petitioners, planars and proxies), the more potential exists for worship.  2) It's the source of the Outer Planes themselves.  The more territory anyone (like a faction or a demon lord) can control, the more influence they have on the shape of the Outer Planes.</p>

<p>The second point needs more details: We know that a place in the Outer Planes can shift location based on the belief.  But we also know that it's very difficult.  It happens, but not very often.  What if it's easier to seize control of real estate in the Outer Planes by first taking control of Prime Material worlds?</p>

<p>So the incentive to control the Prime is based on the needs of gods (the desire to sustain and expand their source of worship) and the needs of everyone else (the desire to control and/or shape territory in the Outer Planes).</p>

<p>This is the motivation behind influencing the Prime worlds.  And pretty much everyone in the Outer Planes wants to influence the Prime.  With so many different factions and religions vying for control, it stands to reason that someone, at some time in the past, created limits to that control.  So demons and angels can only travel to the Prime under specific conditions.  Gods can send avatars, but never their true being.  Planars have more freedom of movement to the Prime, but they're limited by a lack of innate planeshifting abilities (well, most of them are).</p>

<p>Of course, this is all based on my reasoning and it's how I run my Planescape games.  There might be details that conflict with canon, or you may disagree for your own reasons.  Take what you will.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>One thought that I've kinda liked to deal with conundrum #2 is that the dragons protect the Prime from major planar incursions. If any real and significant threat to the Prime arises, the dragons will set aside their other concerns and engage all of their considerable abilities to end the threat. Bahamut and Tiamat, whatever their planar ambitions, will join forces to protect the Prime.</p>

<p>If any species native to the Prime can stand up to outsiders, dragons seem to fit the bill. And the fact that dragons run the gamut of alignments can fit with the over-arching desire to protect the Prime from any planar taking it over, regardless of the planar's alignment.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>They're not fighting over real estate; they're fighting over <span style="font-style:italic">belief</span>.</p>

<p>The real estate is just set dressing. There's as much as there needs to be (even on Gehenna - the fact that it has <span style="font-style:italic">edges</span> doesn't mean there isn't plenty of room within that bounded space). It's effectively infinite, but in the Outer Planes there is no real space (it's all just the <span style="font-style:italic">idea</span> of space beyond the Astral Plane, just the <span style="font-style:italic">idea</span> of infinity). It isn't an actual, physical realm (though it's solid enough to hurt you). It's a realm of reified concepts.</p>

<p>Belief is not infinite. It's a finite resource; that's the whole point. </p>

<p>There are certainly not an infinite amount of planar beings, either. There's only as many as the current levels of souls/belief available to them support.</p>

<p>The Inner Planes are different. They're a realm of physical matter rather than concepts, but space is a tricky thing there, too. You can cross from one infinite plane to another (or anywhere in the plane) in a few days if you know the way, but if you don't it literally takes forever. Even there, though, the natives fight over philosophical differences rather than raw resources. They want to wipe out their philosophical rivals, and the way space works in the Inner Planes it's impossible to get so enough away that your rivals can't find you. </p>

<p>"Why would outsiders bother fighting anywhere but on the mortal world where creation rests?"</p>

<p>There are so many bad assumptions in that question. Remember the Center of All rule: there is no center of the multiverse. The Material Plane is no more important than any other part of the cosmos. When the Outer Planes and Inner Planes shift and change due to conflicts among planar beings, the Material Plane shifts accordingly. When Gehenna captures (conceptual) land from Baator, the Material Plane shifts away from Law and further toward Evil. When Bytopia captures (conceptual) land from the Outlands, the Material Plane shifts toward Law and Good. When fire elementals destroy a smoke paraelemental city, fires burn brighter and cleaner. It doesn't matter that the land in question is effectively infinite, because the <span style="font-style:italic">meaning</span> of the planes and concepts and elements change when symbolically important victories are won.</p>

<p>In the same way, affecting mortal believers can change the planes. But it works both ways, and Creation doesn't "rest" on any one plane. Invading the Material Plane isn't any more effective a strategy than invading an Outer Plane.</p>

<p>As for dragons, they care about themselves, mostly. There was a guild of draconic portal guardians described in 3rd edition, but I don't imagine it's a big thing for them. Gods, nature spirits, and pacts among outsiders all insure that apocalyptic invasions are rare.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

I find this to be an extremely unsatisfying answer to the problem. We'd (or at least I'd) really like to have the Prime actually matter in the setting. That it doesn't matter any more than anything else on the planes really makes for a lot less reason to go adventuring there or have the players care about it at all. It's just...there, and there's no reason for the DM to set an adventure there instead of some exotic locale.</p>

<p>I'd like the prime to really mean something in a setting.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>But you can substitute any plane in that argument. "I'd really like PCs to have a reason to adventure in Acheron. I'd really like the Ethereal Plane to mean something. I want the players to feel like there's something at stake when their characters visit the Demiplane of Dread, or the Plane of Radiance, or the Feywild, or the Nightosphere."</p>

<p>The joy of a Planescape campaign is visiting a variety of planes and having all their adventures matter. Any campaign can emphasize a single world; a planar campaign shows how many worlds interelate and rely on one another. Yes, the Prime matters, but if everything else is just a sideshow, you're really cheating yourself out of using the planes at their full potential.</p>

<p>There are thousands of reasons planar adventurers might visit the Material Plane other than it being the most important part of the multiverse, anyway. Maybe a god is imprisoned there, or the bad guy is there, or a rare ingredient is there, or ancient sorcerers created planar gates there, or a prophecy says the Apocalypse begins there. If you think the Prime is boring compared to other planes, I think you're wrong. What with Spelljammer, parallel worlds, and endless possible cultures, magic, and secrets, the Prime doesn't need its importance inflated.</p>

<p>I think planar beings mostly avoid all-out war on the Prime for fear of destroying it.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>It's funny to see these positioned as mutually exclusive - it seems to me that the prime has the potential to be as or more exotic as anywhere else on the planes. There are plenty of spots in the <a href="forum/log-x-the-primes_.html">Log X</a> thread, for instance, that don't seem to clearly fit anywhere on the planes (ethereal aside). The prime presents the opportunity to unfold literally any idea you might have into a cohesive world without being encumbered by the themes and philosophies that define the planes (that is: supervillain laying low in a pastoral wonderland while quietly raising a secret army? not on Elysium he's not…).</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>I suspect a popular reaction to learning about (but not necessarily visiting) the planes goes like this: "Why should I care? I'm the center of the multiverse."</p>

<p>Along these lines, I've always wondered about this stark prime/planar division - sure, some gnome who's never left Bytopia may know about the planes, but I'm not sure how that knowledge translates into any actual planar savvy. Most Americans seem perfectly aware of China and India and how large they are and perhaps even how fast they're moving, but how many people seriously consider that the world may ever look meaningfully different than the one they know? Or that any of it even matters at all?</p>

<p>I'm not sure how well that analogy holds up, but my point is that folks are pretty good at taking in information as true without absorbing the accompanying existential body blows. Or maybe my point is just that most planars are probably center-of-the-multiverse yokels, too. </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Most planars would not even care if someone plans to build an interplanar highway and has to get rid of one of those.</div></p>

<p>Sure, but would they feel any differently about another plane getting paved over, either?</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>sciborg2</em> wrote:</div>2) Our world is the center of all things: This is a problem when you have infinite planes filled with infinite beings competing over a finite space. Worse when you state that all the planars know how important this single world is.</p>

<p>Why would exemplars bother fighting anywhere but the mortal world on which creation rests?</p>

<p>I understand the world may be hard to access, but the problem is there's little point in doing much else <em>but</em> figuring out a way to influence this one world.</div></p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>atomicb</em> wrote:</div>...most planars are probably center-of-the-multiverse yokels, too.</div></p>

<p>I think these two viewpoints cover a majority of the issue.  On one level, the "common planar" has little to no knowledge of the planes beyond his/her home.  Sure, most planars are probably more worldly (...planarly?) than most primes.  But most Arcadians probably don't know squat about what it's really like on Pandemonium.  It's just too far outside their realm of living.  From this perspective, then, it's reasonable for any planar to assume that his/her plane is the most important.  For our purposes, we can accept that view as a biased one and move on, as it has no impact on how the campaign functions (logically speaking); in other words, an "infinite" number of planars can believe what they want about the importance of any given location, but it won't change the logical construction of the 'verse.</p>

<p>Or if it did, because belief = reality in Planescape, then all those conflicting beliefs cancel each other out.</p>

<p>On another level, though, there are a lot of powerful beings in Planescape who know the Dark of things.  So I agree with Sciborg that there's a logical disconnect in the setting: why should these powerful beings, who are capable of perceiving more truth than most, who can manipulate entire worlds and plane-spanning empires, who have a vested interested in controlling as much territory (real estate, beliefs of mortals, etc.) as possible -- why should these beings bother with anything but "the mortal world on which creation rests?"</p>

<p>I might be adjusting my position here, but I think it's because there are many avenues of approach.  An up-and-coming deity/pantheon may wish to gain followers on the Prime, but that involves time and resources.  If, instead, the pantheon divides its attention and focuses some of its energy on the Outer Planes, it may be able to achieve a significant boost in power by gaining allies, followers or territory.</p>

<p>Of coures, I realize that that statement is lacking in a great many details.  So I apologize if it's not quite clear what I'm trying to say.  Unfortunately, time is pressing and I will have to come back later to refine my thoughts.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Cool thread. Here's one that's been in the back of my mind for a while:</p>

<p>PS adventures seem to assume that the clueless on the other side of one of the Lady's portals really are clueless about it. Which makes sense if it's a temporary portal; but not so much if it's a permanent or even shifting portal. I mean how many weirdos have to show up seemingly out of nowhere before the locals start buying these weird travelers drinks, asking questions, and finding out about the portal and its key?</p>

<p>And what then? Even a shifting portal would develop its own road (or at least a beaten trail) pretty soon after discovery, to make trade and tourism easier. Otherwise, it'd be like modern locals of a rural town not having a road to, or maybe not even hearing of the nearest big city.</p>

         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>Tequila Sunrise</em> wrote:</div>I actually find it hard to imagine any prime world where the primes are truly clueless about Sigil (given shifting or permanent portals).

<p>And primes who live near the portal might very well take pilgrimages or even weekends in Sigil.</div></p>

<p>The rules of the setting allow for such a thing. If you wanted to, you could put a stable, permanent, non-shifting, two-way portal the size of the Arc de Triomphe in a major city like Paris and the key could be something easy like "being alive." Merchants could go in and out of the portal every day, bringing the wealth and terror of the planes to the mortal world. Just as you suggested, everyone would know about Sigil at least in rumor. The factions could be major players in the politics of the world (or, at least, the city around the portal). Planar Common might be the lingua franca of the planet and migrating to the Upper Planes would be as simple as Europeans migrating to the New World. </p>

<p>In practice, it usually doesn't work that way.</p>

<p>Because while the rules technically allow for portals that are stable and well-known, they also allow for portals that are one-shot, or which only activate once a century, or which shift in patterns so complex that no one understands them, with secret or seemingly impossible keys. A world's sole portal to Sigil might be a sewer grate in a backwater hamlet that activates once every five hundred years, whose key is the seed from which mountains grow, whose destination in Sigil varies between a ring hovering upside down 500 feet above street level directly over a shark pit, an ogre mage's hat, and a hole chewed into a dungeon wall by giant rats depending on the time of day. Or a given world in the nigh-infinity of the Material Plane may have no portals to Sigil at all. Portals to Sigil appear at the Lady of Pain's whim and the DM's fiat, and they certainly don't have to be convenient or known to anyone at all. If a portal becomes too well-known, the Lady of Pain can move it. Or the Grixxit, a rogue petitioner who's made it her mission to destroy portals, might destroy it. Or something else might happen on either side to break or lock the portal, either through a spell or just by damaging the frame. The Infinite Staircase is much more problematic in my mind, though I suppose its portals might shift periodically too as the points of greatest creativity in a city change, or as portals are locked or destroyed.</p>

<p>Obviously a permanent portal to Sigil is potentially incredibly convenient, changing a campaign setting that would otherwise largely be confined to a single world to one intimately tied to the multiverse as a whole, and possibly even making easy for a party of low-level adventurers to get anywhere in the planes. Not every world should have one. </p>

<p>Here are some official and unofficial examples. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Blood Hostages by J. Robert King</span><br />
The first novel in the "Blood Wars Trilogy," this is one of only five novels to bear the Planescape logo, and the only one to deal with a group of clueless primes discovering the planes for the first time. In this novel, the portal to Sigil is a cabinet in a rural cabin. The protagonists, the twins Nina and Aereas, have never heard of Sigil before, and their uncle's cabinet may well be the planet's only route to the City of Doors. At the time the book begins, their uncle is the only one in the world that knows about it, and on the Sigilian end it's a secret kept by a gnomish tobacco merchant until some yugoloths discover it.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">To Baator and Back</span><br />
This is an adventure in the <span style="font-style:italic">Well of Worlds</span> anthology designed to bring clueless primes to the planes. There's no portal directly from the Material Plane to Sigil in this adventure; the party stumbles into a portal to Hell in an abandoned wizard's tower, and only discover a portal to the City of Doors after trekking across the plains of Avernus. Again, if the DM desires, this roundabout method may be (at least currently) the only way to reach Sigil from that particular world.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">For the Price of a Rose</span><br />
This is an introductory adventure from the Planescape Campaign Setting boxed set. The portal to Sigil in this adventure is shifting and temporary, appearing on a different world periodically while the Sigilian end stays stable. The key from the Prime end is a freshly cut flower. This portal is basically designed to strand the PCs on the planes, as by the time they want to get back it's probably moved on to another world, and it may well cycle through hundreds or thousands of different planets before it returns to theirs. Plus, it's controlled by a gang of thieves who are certainly not inclined to tell the locals about the secret door they're using to commit crimes.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dragonlance</span><br />
The <span style="font-style:italic">Dragonlance Legends</span> trilogy implies that the sole permanent planar portal in Krynn at the time was in the Tower of High Sorcery in Palanthus, and that was a portal to Takhisis's realm in the Lower Planes. Tarholt's family of dwarves made it to Sigil somehow a few centuries ago, but other than that, Krynn seems a very isolated world. Tarsheva Longreach (in the <span style="font-style:italic">Planewalker's Handbook</span>) somehow knows about the Inn of the Last Home, so it's possible that there's some kind of portal near Solace, but as Solace is obviously not a cosmopolitan planar trade city, the portal must be fleeting, difficult to unriddle, or well-guarded. Maybe it's hidden away in pre-Cataclysmic ruins. After the Summer of Chaos, all the existing planar routes are broken, and there probably isn't any way to Sigil from Krynn until Dalamar finds a way to meet with Elminster and Mordenkainen again much later. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Forgotten Realms</span><br />
Toril is full of portals, but a lot of them are hidden away in dungeon ruins, such as the ruins of the Netherese and Imaskari civilizations, which usually mean hunting through a desert to even find where the ruins are or fighting through the monsters and traps of Undermountain. There's a canonical portal to Sigil beneath the Abbey of the Sword in Cormanthor, but no one knows what the key is.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Greyhawk</span><br />
Oerth has its share of portals, from the portal to the Demonweb Pits in Erelhei-Cinlu to the many portals beneath Castle Greyhawk and the Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth to the mysterious stone circle of Tovag-Baragu. Most of these are hazardous, though, and I'm not aware of any canonical portals directly to Sigil (in <span style="font-style:italic">Dead Gods</span>, it's something of an issue that the PCs have to hunt down rumors of portals to the Inner Planes in the Underdark in order to eventually get back to the City of Doors).  The closest thing I'm aware of is the portal described in the short story "The Weird Occurrence in Odd Alley" by Gary Gygax, published in his anthology <span style="font-style:italic">Night Arrant</span> through his New Infinities company way back in 1987, well before Sigil as such was invented. In the story, the seasoned adventurers Gord and Chert are directed by a gypsy fortune-teller to an alley in Greyhawk City so obscure that most of the city's natives have never heard of it. Neither hero had any idea there was a portal there, and they're only able to find the portal after many hours of searching and accidentally finding a passage only visible at dusk. They would never have found the key (a distinctive coin forged from an otherworldly metal) if they hadn't ambushed and mugged a nonhuman planewalker who happened to be using it at the time. The fact that <span style="font-style:italic">somebody</span> had a key handy indicates there's more than zero traffic between Greyhawk and the extraplanar city beyond, but not enough that seasoned adventurers Gord and Chert had ever heard of the place. The city on the other side of the gate is functionally identical to Sigil - it's a place of interplanar trade, with hundreds of portals to countless worlds and planes. However, the portal they entered through was one-way, they have no idea how to get back, and the guide they go to is <span style="font-style:italic">horrified</span> at the idea that they'd want to go some place as unsafe as Oerth. That said, the city apparently has portals leading to a variety of places on Oerth, and they eventually follow a man to a portal that opens, unexpectedly, in a ceiling twenty feet up in a noble's house in the city of Rel Mord (disrupting a dinner party when they plummet on to a table). The implication is that there is regular traffic between Oerth and the city beyond the gates, but that it's kept secret from the majority of the public.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Mystara</span><br />
There are no known stable portals between Mystara and Sigil. The shadow elf Farrow ended up in Sigil after being banished to the planes by a Glantrian archmage.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">4th edition</span><br />
In the 4th edition <span style="font-style:italic">Dungeon Master's Guide 2</span>, Tradegate is a town on the mortal plane, and it has a prominent gate to Sigil in it. The key needed to operate the portal is known only to Master Trader Duncam, however, and those who pay him 1,000 gp for the knowledge. I don't know what would stop those people from telling others for free, though, unless the key changes regularly and only Duncam has the resources needed to figure out what it's changed to.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Robert Asprin's MythAdventures series</span><br />
The equivalent of Sigil in these books is the Bazaar on Deva, an otherworldly marketplace that caters to travelers from hundreds of alternate worlds. The Bazaar on Deva is well-known to dimensional travelers, but in the first novel the protagonist Skeeve has never heard of it, even after working as an apprentice to a seasoned planewalking mage for several months. Initially, he thinks all otherworldly travelers are devils from his world's legends. The books later reveal that not everyone on Skeeve's dimension of Klah is as ignorant of Deva as Skeeve was, however. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Something From the Nightside by Simon R. Green</span><br />
The equivalent of Sigil in Simon R. Green's Nightside books is the Nightside, a secret metropolis accessible from London "where it's always three A.M." The Nightside was founded thousands of years ago as a neutral zone unclaimable by either Heaven or Hell, and it has portals to countless worlds and times, including Faerie, alternate Earths, Heaven and Hell, places where legends go when they're forgotten, Camelot, and the far future. The Nightside is infamous in occult circles, but most ordinary people have never heard of it. The protagonist gets there in the beginning of the novel through a supply closet in the London Underground; the key is speaking the word "Nightside" into a phone on the wall and then a journey through horrifying, blood-red tunnels and a secret subway station, though it's possible to also stumble into the Nightside accidentally.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

In the real world, there are a number of officially separate cities that grew interconnected (for example the cities of Buda and Pest in Hungary - separated by a river but connected by bridges until it effectively became the unified city of Budapest) In such a set-up, the residents would be much less concerned with crossing between the two planes than they would be travelling a few miles in the "wilderness" to reach the next town.</p>

<p>If you ever find yourself in the unlikely position where you have more exotics running around than Sigil can provide, might I suggest spelljammers? <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/smile.png" title="Smiling" alt="Smiling" class="smiley-content"/> I realise it's not everybody's cup of tea though..</p>

<p>A spelljamming ship could have crashed on your 'backwater' world, and the mixed crew might have over the generations eked out a meager existence and maybe formed an isolated town, or a single crewmember could have been marooned as punishment, and has found his way to civilization where he now regales his grandchildren with tales of his adventures in wildspace and beyond.</p>

<p>It's not Sigil, but the City of Brass seems to have a 'sister city' on Oerth. There is a stable portal between the Burning Cliffs region and the City of Brass, and apparently a town has grown around this portal. I can't for the life of me recall its name, if it was ever revealed at all.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>The town that Glim mentions doesn't seem to have a name, unless someone in the Living Greyhawk campaign came up with one (I wouldn't know). <span style="font-style:italic">Greyhawk Adventures</span> says only (page 97): "A large town has grown up near the center of the conflagration, where there is a gate to the plane of Fire." And yes, the City of Brass is on the other side, though it may (or may not) be a bit of a walk.</p>

<p>Of course, individual DMs can absolutely build permanent, easily usable gates to Sigil in their worlds, or in their versions of official worlds, if their campaigns are very planes-heavy and such a thing seems desirable. This wouldn't change Sigil at all, but might change the Prime world considerably. It just seems that officially, portals to Sigil are not (and Sigil itself is not) inevitably known to the public at large. </p>

<p>In general, there are many examples of gates with towns on both sides. Sylvania and Thrassos, Ribcage and Darkspine, Fortitude and the previous Fortitude, Bedlam and the Madhouse, Excelsior and Heart's Faith, Glorium and Himinborg (there's a sea in between), Plague-Mort and Broken Reach, Pashrita and Savitri's realm, Gloomport and Gloomwrought (another sea in between), Moonstair and Celduilon, Absalom and Shadow Absalom, maybe Curst and the Bastion of Lost Hope. I created the city of Void's Edge to be on the other side of the portal from Torch.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>One thing I always assumed about planescape and the idea of belief=power is that the gods are constantly trying to harvest faith from their believers. The purer faith is the more valuable it is to the gods so clueless prime inhabitants make for an ideal flock. As soon as an intelligent being becomes aware of the planes and the workings of the multiverse the "faith output" decreases. </p>

<p>In a god's mind the ideal prime world would be a low-or-no-magic monotheistic setting (the existence of magic in mortal hands invariably makes gods seem more mundane, and no god likes to share belief).</p>

<p>This concept of faith and its value to gods gives the prime material plane and its worlds a special position - the more backwater and clueless, the better. Many planars know this and suffer form a slight inferiority complex: they know they are not nearly as valuable to the powers-that-be because they are so jaded and in-the-know. To compensate for this they like to stress how clueless all those prime rubes are <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/smile.png" title="Smiling" alt="Smiling" class="smiley-content"/></p>

<p>If a prime world has a strong pantheon or single deity it should usually be in their interest to keep this world form being invaded by planar beings by controlling access to portals, destroying them, making pacts with planar forces to keep them away etc. In other cases there may also be groups of people on a world with the power to restrict planar access, like dragons or a cabal of mages who value their privacy.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>As I recall, at least from older editions of the game, exemplars (at least the evil ones) were not normally able to enter the Prime Material under their own power; they had to be given a way in by a spellcaster already on the Prime. Portals, be they in Sigil or elsewhere, are presumably an exception to this rule, but they don't tend to be particularly efficient or reliable ways to move an army, and as soon as those meddling celestials find out about it, there's a good chance they'll be able to nip your invasion plans in the bud before they get off the ground. I think that your typical infernal general probably figures it's a better plan to first take the upper planes by force, giving the forces of Baator a free hand when it comes to conquering the Prime. You know, once they get that whole Blood War thing sorted out. The more powerful fiends in the abyss, of course, don't have a plan. Well, some of them probably have several, but they likely change from moment to moment.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">
