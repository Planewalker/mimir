      <div class="forum-post-content">
        <div class="dice_rolls">
</div> <p>I have avoided considering renovations of the elemental planes as, to me, the elemental planes are about the elements. For me, belief changes reality on the Outer Planes (and belief is the cornerstone of the existance of the different Outer Planes). But I liked the idea of elemental planes existing without modification due to beliefs. <br />
Some conversations on other threads have made me reconsider. I am rewriting my multiverse so that the “edges” of the elemental planes are affected by the thoughts of the residents. This allows different and conflicting attitudes towards an element to exist in different spots. <br />
For example: Limbo can be a lot of things; but it HAS to be chaotic. By contrast, one area of Fire might have a friendly community where fire is considered a force that ritually purifies. Another area of Fire might have a hostile community where fire is symbolic of destructive fury. While not compatable, both can exist at different spots on the Plane of Fire</p>

<p>Since I lack the insight or energy to tackle another renovation right now, I just wanted to start a forum where people could brainstorm themes or ideas tied to the elemental planes.<br />
As I find that a lot of people don’t know this, I’ll re-state the concept of brainstorming: the intention is to mention any idea that comes to mind. Even if it is the stupidest idea ever spoken, no one else is supposed to find fault with it. Once the ideas are collected, then the next step is to weed out the ideas that are silly or impractical. But for this thread, I only want to see contributions not criticisms [at least not until the thread starts to die down]</p>

<p>Three of the elemental planes were already touched upon for renovations<br />
**Lightning – energy, thrill-seeking, quickness of thought and action <br />
**Ooze – balance of growth vs. decay<br />
**Positive – life, healing</p>

<p>That leaves the following:</p>

<p>Air – freedom, shifting focus</p>

<p>Ash – lost glories (e.g. once great civilizations reduced to ash)</p>

<p>Dust – forgotten lore (e.g. a dusty library)</p>

<p>Earth – solidity, unyeilding, permanance (stone), nuturing (soil)</p>

<p>Fire – passion, fury, purging impurities</p>

<p>Ice – confinement (e.g. putting on ice),  non-existance</p>

<p>Lava – explosive release of force (creative or destructive), divinely sent destruction (e.g. angry volcano goddess)</p>

<p>Mineral/Crystal – rigidity, wealth, harmonics (and maybe healing)</p>

<p>Negative – death, draining, depression</p>

<p>Radiance – intensity, flashes of understanding (i.e. the lightbulb over one’s head)</p>

<p>Steam/Mist – mystery (things appearing out of the mists), vagueness, purification (steam – keeping with the positive position of the plane)</p>

<p>Salt – harsh unaccomodating (e.g. salty language, an old salt), lifeless desolation (e.g. salting the earth, Lot’s wife turning to a pilar of salt), uniting bond (e.g.the salt bond of Arabic culture), protection or good luck (e.g. tossing salt over one’s shoulder), preserving – although in a dessicated way (e.g. salting meat)</p>

<p>Smoke – deception (e.g. blowing smoke), suffering perhaps from loss (e.g. smoke get in your eyes)</p>

<p>Vacuum – grasping hunger?</p>

<p>Water – easy-going (e.g. going with the flow), nurturing </p>

<p>These were all just initial stabs at it. If you disagree, hold your comments. If you think of something to add, please grab an element or two and list the associations you think of. If you have an idea more concrete than vague associations (e.g. you thought of a society of lightning riders), please give a brief description of your idea. Later when the next renovation is done, we will have a resource to start from</p>       </div>

         <p>Looking at the behavior and personalities of the natives, I would say that these are themes:</p>

<p>Air: freedom/movement (e.g. "free as the wind"), grace, wrath (of a storm)<br />
Earth: tradition/slowness to change/obstinance, protection, wrath (of an earthquake)<br />
Fire: passion/wrath, rebirth, decadence<br />
Ice: temperance, lack of emotion, uncaring cruelty/heartlessness<br />

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>For awhile I've also been working on the flavor associations by element, for the purpose of myself and others brainstorming spices for the inner planes.  Here are the associations I've come up with thus far.<br />
Note that SOME of these words lack a consistent definition.  I'm going to list off real-life spices (and foods) with the associated flavor so people know what I'm talking about.</p>

<p>*Aromatic: Allspice, Bay Leaf, Cardamom, Cinnamon, Citron peel, Clove, Coriander, Galangal, Ginger, Lavender, Lemon Zest, Malabathrum/Tejpat, Orange Blosom, Pandan, Rose Blossom, Saffron, Yuzu Peel</p>

<p>*Astringent: Black Currant, Pomegranate, some unripe fruits (juices cause the mouth to feel dry)</p>

<p>*Bitter: Camphor, Cubeb Pepper, Hyssop, Penicillium chrysogenum (bread mold), Rue, Zedoary</p>

<p>*Kelpy: Kombu, Wakame</p>

<p>*Metallic: Aspartame, Blood, Prickly Pear (not a desirable flavor to humans)</p>

<p>*Numbing: Long Pepper, Szechuan Pepper, Vietnamese Coriander, Water Pepper</p>

<p>*Pungent: Black/Brown Mustard, Black Pepper, Chives, Garlic, Grains of Paradise, Green Pepper, Horseradish, Long Pepper, Shallot, Wasabi, White Pepper</p>

<p>*Resinous: Basil, Boldo leaf, Caraway, Cumin, Juniper Berry, Lavender, Pine leaf (used by the NW Indians), Pink/Peruvian/Brazilian Pepper, Rosemary, Thyme</p>

<p>*Sour: Amchur, Anardana, Calamondin, Citric Acid, Dock, Kokum, Lemon, Lime, Bitter Orange, Rueberry, Sorrel, Sudachi, Tamarind, Vinegar, Yogurt/Lactic Acid, Yuzu </p>

<p>*Sweet: Allspice, Angelica, Aniseed, Apple, Date, Fennel, Grape/Raisin, Licorice, Pear, Star Anise</p>

<p>Now by element.</p>

<p>Air: Aromatic<br />
Earth: Sweet, Bitter, Metallic<br />
Fire: Hot (chili pepper), Pungent<br />
Ice: Numbing, Minty, Cooling (ethanol, menthol)<br />
Lightning: Numbing, "Bite" (some gourmet quality cheeses covered in Penicullium camemberti/candidum, such as Humboldt Fog)<br />
Magma: Pungent<br />
Mineral: Metallic<br />
Ooze: Bitter, Sour, Resinous<br />
Salt: Salty (duh), Astringent<br />
Smoke: Smoky (including black cardamom)<br />
Water: Kelpy, Sour</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><span style="font-style:italic">Three of the elemental planes were already touched upon for renovations<br />
Ice – confinement (e.g. putting on ice), non-existance</span></p>

<p>Actually, there is sortof a renovation project for that-- my Paraplane of Ice topic was meant to be that before I understood what the renovation projects were.<br />
I should probably make a post there about overall personality and behavioral traits of the natives, which can be broken down into two separate sub-themes based on either ice/cold or snow/blizzards.  <br />
Oddly enough, these two themes have some opposing traits.<br />
I'll get to that post in Ice in a bit, though I apologize for the convoluted mess that topic has become (I have Asperger's Syndrome, which yes, makes me a bit disorganized.  Oddly enough though, I also have OCD, which makes me ridiculously organized and meticulous to pedantic detail.  My disorganized/lazy side usually wins out, though.)<br />
The difference between the Elemental Planes and the Outer Planes is that themes are not absolute--<br />
that is to say, while as a general theme, the natives will adhere to certain behavioral traits and patterns, there are those who break this rule, as well.  A good example of this is lightning quasielementals vs. shockers, whose behavior is complete opposite.  The lightning quasielementals represent more the norm for the plane (energetic, chaotic, swift, hyperactive, passionate) while the shockers represent an exception to the rule (inquisitive, logical, unemotional)<br />
This is as opposed to creatures of the Outer Planes, who absolutely must adhere in some way to the narrow focus of the plane and alignment.  For instance, you can't have creatures that are sane, dispassionate, pensive, and well-adjusted indigenous to Pandaemonium.  You can most certainly have such beings on the Elemental Plane of Fire however, even though it goes against the general theme that the beings there are passionate and impulsive.</p>

<p>The planes themselves do not represent belief or themes (beyond that used for movement or that found in certain divine realms) because the Elemental Planes represent energy and matter, whereas the Outer Planes represent belief.</p>

<p>One plane that we definitely do NOT need a renovation project on (though perhaps when the renovation projects are finished a summary should be provided) is the Ethereal-- Guide to the Ethereal is pretty damn clear on what the Ethereal's theme is (potential, possibility, and creation), as well that Ptah perfectly represents all these aspects as a power.  Ptah is to the Ethereal what the four Elemental Lords are to the Elemental Planes, basically.  The only addition one might add is that (my theory anyway) the Ethereal plane has always existed in some form, since Possibility has always been there.  <br />
It's probably the one plane that even survives the creation/destruction cycle of the multiverse.<br />
Though Hellbound claims that the Ethereal sprang from the Elemental Planes, this is impossible given what we know of their interaction from Guide to the Ethereal.  </p>

<p>As for the Elemental Plane of Wood in eastern settings, I would designate that as an ethereal demiplane with numerous portals to Air (in Japan at least, wood and air are associated with one another with things such as wind blowing dandelion seeds, fallen leaves, fungal spores, and cherry blossoms, as opposed to wood's association with earth in the west.)  The "Elemental Plane of Metal" would merely be the Quasielemental Plane of Mineral-- they're prettymuch identical, except that in Japanese culture, metal is associated with both earth and electricity.  Which of course poses some problems for the spell lists and associations with Shugenja and Wujen.<br />
The Chinese system of elements poses a further problem since they're arranged much like the Great Wheel, with elemental earth being at the center (with fire opposing water, and metal opposing wood)<br />
I suppose this is one area where belief could possibly alter perceptions of the planes.  We do know that on Abeir Toril, belief affects what planes (other than the Ethereal) are coterminous with areas of the Prime.  <br />
Then again, perhaps the Celestial Bureaucracy is simply the Kara Turian's perception of the Great Wheel.  This does not appear to be the case for the House of Mazca and the other demiplanes, however.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Where exactly does that fit in with the Planescape cosmology?  Is it a Demiplane?  A Transitive Plane?  A divine realm?  What?  And how does it compare to the Seelie Court (wandering divine realm/demiplane)?</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">The connections between the various planes might be complex enough that more than one map of infinity might be equally accurate.</span></p>

<p>I disagree.  The books are quite clear (esp. Inner Planes) as to which planes are coterminous, and that the borders appear like fractals.  The use of portals is the easiest way to get around a standardized cosmology without making things confusing and convoluted, since portals basically break all the normal rules of cosmology (e.g. you can have an outer plane and inner plane connect via portal, despite the fact that they are not coterminous with one another).  <br />
Also, a guide is needed for more than just crossing the inner planes-- as I recall, you literally will not be able to make any progress on an inner plane without a guide, or a magic item keyed to a location (such as the one keyed to the Dismal Delve in Secrets of the Lamp)  I always assumed this was the same as the cliche "faeries' cursed woods" effect (the one that makes the person travel in circles, even if he is literally travelling in a straight line the entire time)</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>I have no idea what that means.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">If the only issue is people wandering in circles, we're left with planes only a few hundred miles across.</span><br />
That's not what I meant.  I meant that non-natives may literally travel in a straight line, but in reality they're running in circles within say-- a 2-mile area.  They're not actually making a full rotation around the plane.  <br />
That's generally (as I understand it) the principle behind the faeries' "get lost/go in circles" curse as well.  The character thinks he/she is moving in a straight line, but he/she is actually running in circles.  In some versions this is readily apparent to any human or faerie witnessing the victim move around, while in many other stories, it's undetectable to mortals (or at least humans).  In some versions this is the result of an enchantment or illusion skewing the victim's perceptions, whereas in others, the victim actually IS moving in a straight line, but the land itself sends them in a circular direction.  However, now that I think about it further, I believe the actual cause is the lack of orientation for non-natives.  There is no north on a single elemental plane, nor is there an up/down direction on the vast majority of planes (Ice and Earth are among the few planes with an objective up/down direction)  Because of this, a non-native cannot tell where he/she is going.  This is similar to the disorienting effects of flight over extremely redundant terrain (such as the Florida Keys or worse, ocean-- esp. during periods of reduced visibility, such as overcast skies or fog)  Without his instruments, an aviator is going to get disoriented as soon as he makes a turn.<br />
On the inner planes, this effect will be far worse.<br />
In fact, I think the wording in the Planescape books actually supports this theory above what you're describing, Ripvanwormer.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>Hyena of Ice</em> wrote:</div><span style="font-style:italic">is that the inner planes are trackless and endless in a linear sense, and elemental guides provide shortcuts through an otherwise unfindable dimension.</span></p>

<p>I have no idea what that means.</div></p>

<p>Well, you wouldn't, because you're not an elemental. Presumedly. I mean, you might be, I suppose, for all I know.</p>

<p>But I described what I meant better in <a href="forum/do-planes-have-be-infinite_.html#comment-60976" class="bb-url">this post</a>. </p>

<p>Basically, if you travel across the plane in a straight line, it's infinite. You'll never reach the end of the plane. You'll never even reach the next settlement. Not only is the plane infinite, but the distance between any two sites is infinite. But elementals can reach the end of the plane so quickly that, if the plane is simply three-dimensional space as primes understand space, elemental planes are tiny. Tiny, and not infinite at all. And if the only thing unusual about them is that non-natives wander around in circles, then how are they not tiny? Is space is ordinary but disorienting, then inner planes are only a few hundred miles across. If they're more than that, despite the short travel distances, then <span style="font-style:italic">something is going on with space</span>.</p>

<p>But there is something screwy going on with distance, because it takes longer to travel between any two points inside an elemental plane than it does to travel to the next plane over. Much longer. You're going to take over a month to travel from one point in the interior to another, even when it only takes a few days to completely cross the plane (seeing nothing interesting the whole time). Even for elementals, who we know aren't just running around in circles. Elementals know their way around, and they get weird distance effects, too.</p>

<p>So distance in the inner planes is weird. It's not just that direction is impossible for non-natives to pinpoint. <span style="font-style:italic">Distance</span> is <span style="font-style:italic">weird</span>. </p>

<p>Now, there might well be something screwy with direction too. It's very possible that not only do non-natives have to deal with the fact that the space between any two sites or settlements on the plane is, for them, infinite, but that they don't even know what direction to go in. My only interpretation of that is that elementals have their own directions that go beyond the normal three. But sure, it's perfectly possible that non-natives aren't even able to comprehend the normal three. Not strictly <span style="font-style:italic">necessary</span> to explain anything, so Occam's Razor might suggest dropping that bit, but it's perfectly possible, and reasonable for the reasons you mention.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>They couldn't possibly be only a few hundred miles across.  If they were, then the whole plane would be densely overpopulated with elementals, genies, and mephits, who each rank in the billions.  Instead, the elemental planes are mostly a frontier realm even to them.  So obviously they have to be pretty damn big-- thousands of miles across at the very least.</p>

<p>I figure that the scenery doesn't look redundant to them like it does to us, in addition to having innate 'senses' of direction.  <br />
Though some scientists have speculated-- even claimed that humans (esp. males) have a certain degree of innate sense of north, in reality (whether those scientists are correct or not-- a mild innate sense of north doesn't do much good when your sense of direction is overwhelmed by the scenery), humans rely entirely on landmarks (and within the past 70 years, instruments) for orientation.  This usually takes the form of a combination of geographical landmarks and celestial bodies.  Over the ocean, we rely entirely on celestial bodies, which is why overcast skies and fog are so disorientating.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Anyway, I promised an essay on Faerie.</p>

<p>The influence of Carl Sargent's <span style="font-style:italic">Monster Mythology</span> (published in 1992) on Planescape shouldn't be underestimated. Many important Planescape deities, such as Ilsensine, Sehanine Moonbow, Gzemnid, the Great Mother, Stillsong, Gorellik, Annam, Psilofyr, and many more were created for this book. The entire Faerie pantheon, or at least the parts that weren't cribbed from Shakespeare and T.H. White, was created for this book as well. And Sargent described the outer planar realms of many of these deities, including the odd Seelie Court that travels through the upper Planes of Chaos, and the gloomy Unseelie Court in the howling depths of Pandemonium. He gave us the first descriptions of both.</p>

<p>But Sargent also mentioned, in the same book, "deep sylvan realms," places in the deep, deep forest where Nature is at its most potent and things work <span style="font-style:italic">differently</span>, where Time does funny things and everything is more or less how you'd expect, from the legends, that Faerie would be.</p>

<p>And Sargent also gave us, in the <span style="font-style:italic">From the Ashes</span> boxed set he designed for Greyhawk at about the same time as <span style="font-style:italic">Monster Mythology</span>, something called Fading Lands. Fading Lands are demiplanes coexistent with the Prime Material Plane instead of the Ethereal Plane. They're otherworldly realms that overlap our own. One of them, the Court of Rings, includes avatars of the Seelie Court hunting about, and it's where the Cat Lord is said to have a bower; you reach it through faerie circles or enchanted wells in the deep woods, and it sounds remarkably like the Seelie Court when it visits the Beastlands. It's not entirely clear if deep sylvan realms are examples of Fading Lands, but they're treated as similar concepts.</p>

<p>Detour, also, to <span style="font-style:italic">For Faerie, Queen, and Country</span> by Carl Sargent and David "Zeb" Cook, an RPG about an alternate Victorian era in which creatures of Faerie coexist openly with our own world, though some have realms of their own. This was another major influence on Planescape, from the dictionary of underworld cant to the random faerie trait chart that fae-blooded PCs could role on, the obvious precursor of tieflings. </p>

<p>Short detour: "Legacy of the Liosalfar" in Dungeon #42 (1993), in which Faerie was defined as an alternate Material Plane inhabited by good faeries (including elves); evil ones were banished long ago.</p>

<p>Now zoom over to the Forgotten Realms, where elves are said to have migrated to Toril from another world called Faerie.</p>

<p>Zip back to Spelljammer and the adventure <span style="font-style:italic">Crystal Spheres</span>, which presented us with Faeriespace, a crystal sphere filled with a single massive tree the size of a solar system, from which suns and moons hung like ripe fruits. One could have any number of adventures on those nigh-endless branches without ever realizing the millions of miles of solid wood beneath you. Some of us thought Faeriespace may have been the world of "Faerie" that the elves of Toril migrated from.</p>

<p>Except, zip forward, air rushing behind us until we reach 4th edition and Faerie was explained to be the Feywild, moving back into sync with Toril after its long exile after the Sundering (I guess). </p>

<p>Now back up, eying in a cursory manner the version of Faerie we got in the 3rd edition <span style="font-style:italic">Manual of the Planes</span>, and the Fey Feature on the WotC webpage. Not really very important except that it gave us a mention of Faerie among the demiplanes listed in Dragon #353.</p>

<p>For good measure, we can look at the Shadow World in the Birthright campaign, a version of Faerie complete with faerie queens and sidhe horribly corrupted by an evil god. <span style="font-style:italic">A Guide to the Ethereal Plane</span> explained that the Shadow World was a variant Border Ethereal.</p>

<p>Oh, almost forgot. The Planescape anthology <span style="font-style:italic">Well of Worlds</span> by Colin McComb. In the land of Kellinon, on the Prime Material Plane, people believe in the land of Faerie, where "unnatural" creatures like dwarves, elves, and gnomes come from. Except, as the adventure explains, there's no such place. An elven bard made it up, and people believed it. It's a scam. At least, that's how things are in the land of Kellinon, where the influence of the gods is not felt as strongly as it is on many worlds.</p>

<p>Colin McComb <span style="font-style:italic">also</span> designed Faraenyl, in the "Planescape reunion" <span style="font-style:italic">Beyond Countless Doorways</span>, a small plane inhabited by elves and fey and ruled over by the lords of the four seasons. </p>

<p>My point, if I even have a point, is that there are actually many different faerie planes connected to the Planescape multiverse to one degree or another. There's the Seelie and Unseelie Courts, where the fey gods live in the Outer Planes. There are the deep sylvan realms and Fading Lands, including the Court of Rings. There's the false Faerie believed in by the folk of Kellinon and the corrupted Faerie/Border Ethereal Plane that surrounds the world of Aebrynis, where kings rule by right of divine blood. There's the third edition Faerie where celestial and fiendish elves war, which might be an ethereal demiplane. There's Faraenyl, which might also be an ethereal demiplane. There's the Feywild of fourth edition, which is very similar in many ways, and the Faerie of Dungeon #42, which is similar in a few ways. </p>

<p>If the Elemental Plane of Wood is Faerie, then it might be a demiplane, a Fading Realm, it might be Faeriespace or the Feywild or something else.</p>

<p>And the elementals know directions that few can perceive. Perhaps they know how to turn right instead of left, and find relatively unexplored paths and borders similar to the cosmology known to the people of the eastern lands, directions that join the planes of Earth, Water, and Fire to the seldom-remarked-upon planes of Metal and Wood.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Exactly (although we don't actually know if they rank in the billions). But you're exactly right, anyway.</p>

<p>Yet you can travel across the entire plane in only a few days worth of travel. So either they're only a few hundred miles across, or something's screwy with inner planar space. I assume the latter.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Regarding the mystery of inner planar travel, what if the plane is wound like a ball of yarn? If you travel on a linear path (that is, along the "string") it would take you ages to reach the end of the plane. If however you hop off the string and just cut straight across the radius of the ball of yarn, it takes you no time at all. Non-natives are unconsciously compelled to travel along the string, perhaps because that is all they can normally perceive as a viable path, or possibly because they can't escape the confines of the string, although they can't perceive this effect. The shape doesn't even have to be directly analogous. The main point is that direction may not conform to a typical understanding that prevents accurate navigation, perhaps because the plane has a highly unusual shape. You don't even need to explain it with particularly fancy physics. It could just be that people's perception is screwy, not allowing them to see what would be apparent were the string effect visible.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>If you will permit a bit of math.  Don't panic!  It's not a hard kind.</p>

<p>Topology is the study of things like place, space, directions, shapes, and paths.  One of the basic ideas about it is that a "place" doesn't have to be what we normally think of as a place at all.  Ever seen a phase diagram for a substance like water?  On one axis is temperature, on another axis is pressure.  At some temperatures and pressures the substance is solid, at others it's gas, and so forth.  You can call each particular choice of temp and pressure a point in a 2-dimensional space, a place.  The collection of points where the water is in various phases are just what you would expect them to be, regions with a definite shape and area.  If you want to stick a third axis on this, say salinity, you have volume.  Volume, area and length are all examples of <span style="font-style:italic">measure</span>, which is "volume" in various dimensions.  Probability is another way of assigning a measure to sets.</p>

<p>Now, what's a path in this space?  Well, if your points are temperature and pressure, say (t,p), then increasing the pressure while holding the temperature constant goes from (t,p1) to (t,p2).  You go through all the pressures in between, and you get a path.  So a path is a set of joined points in the space.</p>

<p>Okay.  Elemental planes.  They're not really places, are they?  The Prime Material plane is made out of places, where the paths are physical directions.  The elemental planes are made out of, well, their elements.  Maybe a "place" on an elemental plane is a description of one of the infinite array of states that it's possible for that element to be in, and paths between them are state changes.  This being Planescape, possible state descriptors probably include things like "happy/sad," "enchantment level," "consciousness factor," "good/evil + law/chaos imbuement," and the like.  A native of Air occupying a given nearby collection of "places" is a chunk of Air that has sustainably decided to occupy a few points by being airy in a certain way today.  This is the natural way it thinks about place and direction, in terms of states of air-elemental essence and the state shifts between them.  When you summon an air elemental to the Prime, it can't get very far from its element, because "far" doesn't make sense to it without reference to its element.</p>

<p>And you're the same way on Air.  When you go there, you've been translated, spiritually and/or physically, into elemental air, occupying a particular coherent collection of states.  You continue to perceive this as you-shaped, and in a physical place, because that's the way you, a Prime Material native, see directions, but given that you're seeing a different-dimensional state space, this is going to be a fairly limited slice of reality there.  If what you see is an approximation of the boundary of a Mandelbrot set, the distance around the edge looks finite, but the better your eyesight, the longer the boundary is, and potentially its infinite.  It's not infinite-dimensional, but it's more than 1 and less than 2, and it takes the right perceptions to see.  If you can, then there are places where it's zero distance to hop over a gap which a fuzzier sight would see as a cusp that you have to circle around.</p>

<p>By the way, same goes on the Outer Planes.  When you're journeying on the Abyss, the way I figure it, you're inhabiting a collection of states of essence of chaotic evil.  If you're lawful good, then those states are going to be interfering with each other massively, because the impulses the structure is encoding are at odds with the constituent material (you can write a curse in Celestial, too).  Same goes for, say, fire elementals on Air, or intrusions of rock into Air.  The animate elemental has an easier time of it, because his structure includes self-repair and sustainability functions, but the rock will eventually wear down, because it's not natural for essence of air to be in rocky sorts of states.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I thought phase diagrams were just systems for describing the behaviors of substances under various conditions. I'm not gathering the analogy you are trying to draw. Though your idea sounds interesting I don't quite see how that relates to a spatial understanding of something. Phase diagrams seem to be just a way of graphing out that information. I get that you might say at one point water behaves like a fluid, at another a gas and so on, and I see how the same substance in each of these instances will have a different shape and volume and so on, but I don't see how that correlates really to something like the inner planes, or really why that would affect anything in terms of distance for a native. Water under various conditions still has a fixed set of properties that would be navigable by conventional means, and I don't really see why a thing made of water would have any less difficulty navigating something simply because it is of a similar substance in varying states, except insofar as it can directly control the behavior of that element. I may be missing something critical in your explanation though so I would love to here the idea elaborated upon. It probably doesn't help that I am only vaguely familiar with phase diagrams, much of which came in the last 10 minutes reading wikipedia entries. Basically I just don't see how the diagrams are really any different from any other Cartesian graph, and why this creates some new understanding of "place" that we otherwise don't think of. </p>

<p>Also, the concept of place is sort of used vaguely here to me. I don't see why you should deny its usage in an elemental plane unless you are using a very particular definition of place (which I assume you are, but I am unclear on what particular meaning you are suggesting). Personally I would consider the elemental plane to be filled with places, they just might not really be easily distinguishable or navigable, especially to non-natives that have a hard time recognizing landmarks in what seem vast repetitive expanses of raw element. To me denying the elemental planes "places" is basically denying it physicality all together, which seems a bit drastic for planes that almost embody the essence of physical.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I really, really like Jem's idea. You're not traveling through space, but through an abstract reality where qualities like temperature and moisture level are dimensions as real as height and depth. Going fifty miles "ductile" or "hardness" is as physical a journey as longitude and latitude, if you know how. It doesn't make the elemental planes non-physical. It does the opposite, really. Traveling the planes shouldn't be like traveling through mundane space. It can't be, if they work as described. You're traveling through a metaphysical landscape.</p>

         <p>Archduke: Cartesian graphs are a fine example.  The Greeks already knew about parabolas, circles, and the like.  Descartes' fantastic idea was to take algebraic notions, like x-squared, and associate them to points in a flat two-dimensional space.  He was the one who said, "all that stuff about circles?  It applies to pairs of numbers (x,y) that satisfy x-squared plus y-squared equals 1."  And all of a sudden you can do geometry by solving equations, which <span style="font-style:italic">blew people's minds</span>.  Newton ran like hell with it and invented calculus.</p>

<p>Here's a link to a phase diagram for the diesel engine: <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/thermo/imgheat/diescyc.gif" title="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/thermo/imgheat/diescyc.gif">http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/thermo/imgheat/diescyc.gif</a> .  They've drawn arrows indicating where the engine goes in the phase space.  What I'm asking you is to imagine the Elemental Plane of Diesel, sort of, as a place where that path is an <span style="font-style:italic">actual path in space</span>.  If you went there, and walked in a rectangle around a certain eternal flame, you would generate some power that you could use for magic or something else -- <span style="font-style:italic">if</span> you could figure out which direction was "temperature-wise" and which direction was "pressure-wise."  That doesn't come easily to you, but it's as easy as walking in a circle, to a native of that plane.  They can also show you where the border is: look, Temp=0, the realm of the Heat Sink.  By virtue of the spell or the portal that sent you there, you can get around a bit, but not as easily as a native.  A really good spell, say one that sent you there and polymorphed you into a diesel elemental, might get you all sorts of funky senses that would allow you to go in those directions.</p>

<p>Aligned Outer Planes like to seize real estate from neighboring planes because it claims not land, but sets of concepts, under that alignment's aegis.  When a gate-town to Baator slips across the border, some clutch of barely-legal, just barely justifiable-as-neutral tricks of law are now considered by the Planescape multiverse to be evil acts.  Originally, doing them would have sent you to the Outlands.  Now, doing them will send you to the same "place" -- which is in the Nine Hells.</p>

<p>How does this wind up affecting play?  Mostly, it just justifies the game rules.  Although you might use it to run a plot concerning some of those ideas.  Perhaps a group of Ciphers is attempting to weaken the Gray Waste by figuring out ways to treat depression and pull land away from it.  Maybe the last Hopeless slipped across due to a wave of drug use, and the group is trying to get Sigil and some nearby regions to contribute to a rescue effort by considering an addict to be neutral instead of evil -- recognizing addiction as a disease (those poor people!) instead of a sin (those doped-up layabouts!), for example.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>But cartesian graphs and calculus are really just descriptions of a series of points, or in the case of calculus, change over time. Both are useful ways of describing distance as a property of the world, but distance has a property all its own that is inherent in the nature of space time. That is, the mere description of space is not space itself any more than the word "space" is a useful proxy for actual space. They are just ways of comprehending that concept and conveying our understanding through sets of information. The graph is not space in itself, and while I can represent space using a Cartesian graph, this does not make all Cartesian graphs representative of space. So, while we can graph hardness and temperature and so on, and use these graphs to describe these properties, they are just a way of visually conveying the different properties of a substance in varying states. Neither of these things really describe space at all, or anything all that analogous to space. At best they describe the properties of a thing that occupies space.</p>

<p>If you don't really relate things in spatial terms, by what principle when I enter the plane of Earth is it determined that my nose is placed in a particular area, and my ears in another? With no spatial reference, presumably the reference becomes based on phase diagrams, which means the phase of any particular part of my body should determine its "location". So my organs with large water content may end up in a radically different part of a plane than my bones because they are matter in different phase states. Beyond that, any differences on the molecular level should have similar results. Am I misunderstanding something about how that would work?</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Following up Jem and VanWormer's comments; this also ties in well with how I arbitrarily defined the larger "transitive" planes. For me:<br />
Astral and the Outer Planes = thought<br />
Ethereal and the Inner Planes = qualities of existance<br />
Prime = time-space</p>

<p>I gave each division a couple of axes. Since the Inner and Outer axes are pretty well-known; I'll just mention that I had the "demiplane" of Time to exist as a larger all encompassing arena (much like the Astral holds the Outer Planes and the Ethereal holds the inner) </p>

<p>I had one axis on this "Meta-plane of Time" (better term in my layout) of course be the arrow of time and a second axis be that of probability. <br />
Chronomancers have mastered the ability to step into the meta-plane and re-enter at various points along the first axis. <br />
If one travels along this second axis, he is jumping to another alternative reality. The traveler is at the same point in time, but in a world where history took a different path. </p>

<p>Since the Prime is set up this way, residents tend to think in terms of time, direction and cause-effect. <br />
The other planes aren't as rigidly bound by these sorts of rules (e.g. time can flow differently in the fey kingdoms, distances aren't hard and set in the Outlands, creator beings can create themselves out of nothing, etc.)<br />
Much like the confusion that Primes experience when told to travel towards "ductile" perhaps some of the duller specimens of trapped elementals and beings of the Outer Planes get confused by concepts of exact time or rigid, non-dreamlike causality. <br />
[Perhaps this is a explanation for why beings like genies were able to be trapped or coersed into servitude - they got lost upon arrival to this plane and then misunderstand the real meaning of a shi'ar's contract to serve for "1001 days". More crafty or more traveled species (e.g. fiends) have done their homework and won't fall so easily into such traps<br />
By comparison, imagine a Prime agreeing to work for an efreet until the "flame produced smoke", that shouldn't be long, should it?]</p>

<p>I guess that this sort of reasoning also negates the argument of "Do the planes have to be infinite?" on another thread. If time and space aren't the cornerstones of your domain, do the terms "infinite" or "eternal" really mean what they do to us?</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Notice that you're referring to time as a dimension there, which wasn't an idea before Einstein.  The distance between objects that you're picturing as a simple geometrical distance in 3 dimensions isn't real.  The distance between two events in reality is not in space, but in 4-dimensional spacetime, and it's called the Lorentz metric.  If you're okay with including time as a dimension, now imagine this fantasy world where "conscious" and "enchantedness" and "earthiness" are dimensions.  That's the Plane of Earth.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>The graph is not space in itself, and while I can represent space using a Cartesian graph, this does not make all Cartesian graphs representative of space. So, while we can graph hardness and temperature and so on, and use these graphs to describe these properties, they are just a way of visually conveying the different properties of a substance in varying states.</div></p>

<p>Sure, but you can picture something moving around in that space, and that makes perfect sense in terms of the varying state of that system.  An engine moves around in a rectangle or circle.  The part where we add a fantasy element is where we imagine ourselves saying that this convenient fiction is actually a real place, and we can go there, and actually do the moving around.</p>

So my organs with large water content may end up in a radically different part of a plane than my bones because they are matter in different phase states. Beyond that, any differences on the molecular level should have similar results. Am I misunderstanding something about how that would work?</div></p>

<p>Yep.  You're worrying about a physical distance when the distance that matters on Earth is one of atomic Earth states.  You-ness, in D&amp;D, is probably a very coherent collection of states of elemental Earth.  When a spell or a portal moves you to the Plane of Earth, the various states of matter that included you-ness are all very near each other, and importantly, they're connected by short paths -- the various parts of you are points in the state space that are a small distance apart, according to the metric on points in Earth.</p>

<p>And remember Rule Zero.  If all this nonsense isn't fun, don't sweat it.  :^)</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>That's all any map is. In our world, the points in question are defined by longitude and latitude (altitude can also be important). On other planes, things may work differently. </p>

<p>Space has special properties in our universe. In other universes, other qualities may have the same qualities space has here.</p>

<p>This makes perfect sense to me. I think it's brilliant. </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>If you don't really relate things in spatial terms, by what principle when I enter the plane of Earth is it determined that my nose is placed in a particular area, and my ears in another?</div></p>

<p>Oh, there's space in the Inner Planes, too. An infinite amount of space. You can travel as far as you want in the three spatial coordinates, but you'll never get any closer to the border regions. For that, you'll need to travel in other dimensions. <a href="http://mimir.net/mapinfinity/synjyn.html" class="bb-url">This has long been theorized</a>, but Jem's idea of using elemental qualities to define the dimensions is pretty damn interesting.</p>

<p>Alternately, you don't even need spatial dimensions. If you're in the Inner Planes you're reoriented, so depending on which way you're facing, your nose is pointed toward Heat or Dryness instead of North and West. Now, you probably won't notice. The length of your body isn't much, so distinguishing the difference in dryness between your nose and toes would be like lying down aligned with the North Pole on our world and determining north by which side of your body is colder. But elementals can do it. </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div> With no spatial reference, presumably the reference becomes based on phase diagrams, which means the phase of any particular part of my body should determine its "location".

Beyond that, any differences on the molecular level should have similar results. Am I misunderstanding something about how that would work?</div></p>

<p>As I read it, yes. The dimensions refer to the topography of the plane, not the topography of visitors to that plane. If you point your nose toward Heat, your nose becomes imperceptibly hotter, but your organs don't become reshuffled and rearranged by how hot they already were. Your body is treating the hot-cold dimension as if it were a spatial dimension, so you're not protruding into a radically different part of the plane - only the length of your body, around six feet or so, for humans. But the range from hot to cold isn't infinite; it's the difference between Ash and Fire, or the difference between Water, Air, and Ice. So you travel along that dimension to travel to other planes. </p>

<p>And yeah, my reading of the Outer Planes is also the same as Jem's. If you're walking through the Outlands from Ecstasy to Hopeless, you're walking along the moral dimension, and each site and burg you find along the way has been ranked according to how the multiverse currently defines the morality of each concept the sites and burgs represent. If something slides from one plane to another, the new plane has subsumed that concept. And that's one of the big reasons belief is power.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>This is all way over my head....  <br />
Which is probably why my take on the Inner Planes is so different from yours.<br />
Besides that, encorporating modern quantam physics into the setting is just asking for trouble.<br />
First of all, I'm told that prettymuch the only reliable sources are college course materials.  The stuff that's been dumbed down (again, I'm going by what I'm told by people who understand the stuff, because I most certainly do not) is just pop-physics junk (which sure, you'll find in multitude in any D&amp;D setting, but still, you want to be able to separate the realistic from the fantastical)</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>^^Yes you did.  The 4th dimension (time) was brought up along with the Lorentz Metric.  That's Quantam Physics right there.  That and all this spatial stuff.  also this:</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Oh, there's space in the Inner Planes, too. An infinite amount of space. You can travel as far as you want in the three spatial coordinates, but you'll never get any closer to the border regions. For that, you'll need to travel in other dimensions. This has long been theorized, but Jem's idea of using elemental qualities to define the dimensions is pretty damn interesting.</span></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>The Lorentz Metric isn't quantum physics, it's general relativity (quantum physics is about the subatomic scale). And it wasn't in the context of using it in D&amp;D. That spatial stuff doesn't remotely resemble real physics; it's pure fantasy. More than anything, it's like Flatland on acid.</p>

<p>You said something like that in the infinity thread, too, which confused me, since I wasn't thinkiing about real science at all. I basically just summarized the printed rules without venturing much interpretation of my own.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Yeah.  Quantum physics might be combined with general relativity some day, but that's a ways off, and string theory probably has very little to do with Planescape unless you think that, well, obviously strings are what the Norns are weaving, right?  ;^)</p>

<p>Plato's categorization of the elements had the four basic elements divided by two qualities: wet/dry, and warm/cold.  Fire was warm and dry; Earth was warm and wet.  Water was cold and wet; Air was cold and dry.  (This is why Ice is between Water and Air; the common quality they share is cold.)</p>

<p>So, for example, Water is between Air, with which it shares cold, and Earth, with which it shares wet.  Toward Air is drier, and toward Earth is warmer.  The wettest, coldest part of the plane is the core Water part.  Pos and Neg are obviously directions as well as the places they go to.  So a place on Water might lie just positive of the Dry-ward side or Ice-ward side of Bob's House.  A fellow on Ice would refer to a point a few days' climb Airward or Dryward of where you are now.  (As it happens, on Ice, Air-ward is definitely up.)</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Oh, and in the Oriental cosmology of the elements the directions are consistent: each of the five elements is in a relation with the others.  There is a generating cyle (fire produces (as Ash!) and earth yields metal), and an overcoming cycle (wood penetrates earth, and earth absorbs water).  So each of the five elements is in a definite direction from the others -- in fact, consistent enough that a wu jen might be able to learn how to travel in those directions.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>OK, I'm threadjacking myself and I'm opening up a can of worms; but based on all the shifting placement of the elemental planes (I know they have had a standard placement for a while but as seen in the examples above, there were/are alternative ways of looking at it) and given some non-standard concepts (like additional planes to correspond to the Asian "elements"); I have to say that I've actually liked the "Sea of Elemental Chaos" approach to things in 4e.</p>

<p>While I do have some major axes in the Inner Planes (one for degrees of solidity, one for molecular excitation (heat), and the good old Pos/Neg); I don't find much benefit to locking the Elemental Planes into rigid positions and limited borders. <br />
Do you want to have a plane of sandstorms where Earth and Air touch? Go ahead and drop it in! <br />
For my tastes, if the PCs can truly understand the geography of the Inner Planes, then I'm not being creative enough.</p>

<p>For the Outer Planes, I like the more orderly layout as one idea gradually changes to the idea dominating the bordering realm. But since the "elements" are obviously an arbitrary arrangement, it seems appropriate to me that they are more vaguely geographically defined.</p>

<p>Aside from aesthetics (or perhaps keeping things clear in your own head), can anyone offer a good argument in favor of the more rigid placement of the Inner Planes?</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I could easily give a whack at it, basically the reason that it would be in a 'rigid' or more acurately 'semi-rigid' form is that each plane would be at least a within a certain 'distance' of the 'prime material' as well as the 'temporal prime'. Mind you spatio-temporal physics indicates that time is not just 'past', 'present', and 'future'... it indicates that the past, present and future blend into and effect each-other just like all the points in space do and are just as '3-dimensional'. So basically the 'planes' are simply the closest in terms of the 'magical' dimensional co-ordinates and can be considered to have a limited 'orbit' around the temporal and material primes.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

There's already a place like that; the divine realm of Shu (known as "Desert Wind").  There are also elemental pockets which more than make up for the limits of a rigid placement.  (I made Wood a demiplane because it doesn't fit with the overall theme of the other elements.  After all, wood is a cellular structure.)</p>

And Fire is a chemical reaction and Lightning is a discharge of subatomic particles.
Obviously, we aren't talking the elements of the periodic table here (and "The Order of the Stick" had a cute joke on that). We are talking the broad categories that the earlier cultures arbitrarily defined as elements. So I don't see any good reason that Wood should only be a demiplane as opposed to Fire being a "true" elemental plane except that (perhaps) fewer people believe Wood to be an element.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>Hyena of Ice</em> wrote:</div>It's tradition, as well as Planescape canon [to maintain the more rigid arrangement elemental planes]</div>
But if you look at the history of the planes, this argument doesn't hold up. Gygax arranged the elemental planes one way; then they got re-arranged; then they got new planes added. Now the canon is that they are in a swirling mass (at least I believe that is the current canon, I haven't read the new books)
The question is, what are the reasons for prefering one over the other (and personally, I don't feel the "because that's the way I've always done it" is the strongest of arguments)?</p>

<p>As I said above, I like the new system (as I understand it) where the elements can interact and shift in odd non-Euclidean ways (no pun intended, placing Euclid and "elements" in the same sentence). You're free to disagree with me; but I'm interested in actually gameplay or increased creativity reasons for prefering the (circa) 3e arrangement.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

I'd go for a hybrid between the 2, in that there's the Inner Planes arranged in the ways that they were in 2e with the 4 elements, 2 energy planes, 4 para-elements and 8 quasi-elements, but at the centre of all the inner planes is something called the Tempest which is a random mixture of the elements and energy planes.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I like this solution. It actually ties in well with something I had worked on.</p>

<p>Following the Rule of Threes; I was envisioning three cities at the "centers" of each of the transitive planes<br />
-Sigil - a (relatively) open city for the Outer Planes</p>

<p>-In the Temporal Prime (thank you for pulling up this name VanWormer - my copy of "Chronomancer" is burried but this is exactly what I meant in my "meta-time" comments above), I had a closed city/citadel populated by a legion of chronomancers/reality-hoppers that try to prevent or minimze the damage caused by time-travelers and "sliders". </p>

<p>-In the center of the elemental planes, I was envisioning a city that the elemental races intended to be a "Sigil for the Inner Planes" but without an overriding authority (like the Lady of Pain), it had just degraded into a battlefield between the elements and trade went back to the respective planes (City of Brass, City of Glass, etc.) <br />
I realize your concept is probably much larger than a single city. But it still fits in nicely with the ideas I was batting around (and the name "The Tempest" is much better than what I had come up with). <br />
Your combo allows for the more traditional settled homes of the elemental planes and for a churning interaction of the elements that could produce interesting possibilities</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I think the 18-plane inner planar system from 1e to 2e is <span style="font-style:italic">basically</span> correct, but it's possible to go in alternate "directions" and see alternate configurations. Which might mean the Chinese elemental system is just as correct. It's not a matter of belief so much as perspective. Look at the planes one way, you see one configuration, and if you look at them another way, you see another. </p>

<p>Example: the novel <span style="font-style:italic">Celestial Matters</span> by Richard Garfinkle features a centuries-long war between Greeks who have achieved space travel using science more or less identical to Aristotle's view of the universe and Chinese whose science is based on Taoist alchemy. Their views of science and the elements are completely contradictory, but somehow they both work. The Greeks believe there are four elements, based on indivisible atoms of each elemental type. The Chinese believe there are five elements which can transform into one another, something impossible in the Greek model. But they manage it anyway. Neither group is "wrong." Both models are valid, but are only part of the truth.</p>

<p>I think the Plane of Burning Skies from Necromancer Games' <span style="font-style:italic">City of Brass</span> boxed set might be worth using, since they detailed it so well. Basically it's a border region between the elemental planes of Air, Fire, and Earth, which might be reinterpreted as between the planes of Smoke, Fire, and Magma, though that would logically be a <span style="font-style:italic">lot</span> less hospitable than the Plane of Burning Skies, which is essentially a desert with a strange sky and a lot of elemental and planar creatures roaming around it. It's meant to be a "common ground" between those three planes where the inhabitants can meet to war or trade. These are, of course, three planes that shouldn't share a border region in the traditional planar scheme, since Air and Earth are on opposite sides of Fire.  But maybe it could happen anyway, somewhere close to the middle of the inner planar sphere. The City of Brass is supposed to be on the very edge of the Elemental Plane of Fire, connected to a bazaar on the Plane of Burning Skies by a bridge.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Yeah, I loved City of Brass, but the Plane of Burning Skies (despite how interesting it is) is difficult to encorporate into the canon.  Seems like the easiest ways to go about it is either making it an Ethereal Demiplane with numerous portals to Fire, Magma, Smoke, Earth, and Air, or demote it to the rank of Elemental Fire "Sub-Region" and have it consist of overlapping elemental pockets.</p>

<p>Seriously, though, I think the Elemental Pockets idea fixes most (not all-- how would you encorporate the Plane of Wood?  Going by Japanese depiction, it would combine positive and air, or possibly positive + air + water.) of the problems earlier addressed.  You can sidestep the limited size rules for elemental pockets by simply placing several of the same type of pocket overlapping one another.  It also allows the elements to be combined in ways not normally possible, such as earth + air and fire + water.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

As I said above, I like the new system (as I understand it) where the elements can interact and shift in odd non-Euclidean ways (no pun intended, placing Euclid and "elements" in the same sentence). You're free to disagree with me; but I'm interested in actually gameplay or increased creativity reasons for prefering the (circa) 3e arrangement.</div></p>

<p>Well, perhaps this is a vastly oversimplified view, seeing as how this thread has become so esoteric - but here goes:</p>

<p>Allowing the elemental planes to overlap and homogenize makes them lose their special flavor.  Sure you can have a plane of sandy storms and licking flame (where earth and air and fire meet), but how is that significantly different from a harsh blasted prime world with sulpherous volcanoes and terrible (perhaps magically induced) storms that continually kick up all the silt?</p>

<p>Isn't the entire purpose of the Prime Material Plane to act as a confluence of the various Elemental Planes?  Small (well, relatively speaking) crystalline orbs floating in the phlogiston, each with a wonderful blend of Earth, Air, Water, Fire, Life, and Death mixing and matching in various degrees to form the worlds we've all adventured on.</p>

<p>The Elemental Soup cosmology, wherein various pockets of differing elements freely mix and match, seems like you've just relocated the Prime.  Oh sure you can make a really cool water pocket, with chunks of earth surfaces with clashing rival kingdoms clinging to them, and maybe throw in a blast of churning air to add some more randomness to it.  Or you could just build the same theme on a prime world deep in some ocean trench - with cliff faces containing warring sahuagin tribes, and an open gaseous vent at the unfathomable depths of the trench that spits up toxic fumes from time to time.</p>

<p>The rigidity of the Inner Planes, to me, gives them their unique flavor.  When I build an adventure in the plane of Fire - the dominant theme is going to be FIRE.  If my PCs go to the Positive Energy Plane - it's going to be all about dealing with positive energy.  Small pockets of non-native elemental matter are exceedingly few and far between.</p>

<p>Homogenization simply strips the elemental planes of their uniqueness.  If you want to combine Air and Earth to make a series of linked sky-castles - why not just do that on a prime world?  I see the pre-4e Inner Plane arrangement as a beautiful and symmetrical representation of elemental absolutes.  This, in turn, makes the prime more special, as a <span style="font-style:italic">meeting place</span> of these various forces - a breathtaking confluence that us mortals take for granted.</p>

<p>This rigid separation also mirrors the Outer Planes.  If you think mixing the Inner Planes into one soup makes for interesting gameplay, why have separate, belief based, Outer Planes?  I suppose you easily could combine The Nine Hells, Hades, and The Abyss and just call it <span style="font-style:italic">Hell</span> - wherein demons, devils, and all manner of evil minded creatures (sinister pact-making types, as well as rampaging brutes) reside - but I think that makes the game a pale comparison of what it can be.</p>

<p>That is just my thoughts on the matter, and of course your mileage can (and probably does) vary.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I think Palomides is suggesting a middle ground, here. The planes are broadly homogeneous, but their configurations are less strictly ordered. So there's a Plane of Fire and it has everything Planescape's Plane of Fire has, and it's probably infinite in some sense, but you can travel directly from there to Earth, Ooze, Wood, Metal, Plastic, or Mineral, and there are unexpected border regions. It's not all one elemental soup, but it's not just 18 planes in a fixed configuration either. It's an unlimited amount of planes in an undefined, shifting configuration.</p>

<p>The advantage to keeping a fixed configuration, I think, would be continuing the Unity of Rings theme you see elsewhere in the multiverse. As Hyena said, you <span style="font-style:italic">can</span> fit just about anything you can imagine in the traditional rings, justifying unusual combinations with planar bleeds, elemental pockets, and elemental vortices (and let's not forget entropes). What's harder is justifying a cosmos where two civilizations can have entirely different models of the Inner Planes and both be equally correct. It's a little frustrating to say, "Sorry, people of Suhfeng, but your model is just wrong and not as enlightened as they are in Greyhawk.  How does it feel to be so ignorant about the true nature of the planes? Clueless berks." It feels like enshrining ethnocentrism.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>In addition, the rigid version of the inner planes plays on what basically led me to link the mass extinction events that parralel those in real life to events on the inner planes: balance.  <br />
A major theme in 2E is that the outer and inner planes have both reached an equilibrium where each plane is represented equally, with none dominating the other.<br />
Disaster strikes when one of the elemental planes gains a foothold over the others-- the Permian Triassic extinction event is a perfect example of this.  <br />
Fire and Smoke cause the prime worlds to become arid, for Pangaea to form (creating a lot of deep seas and continental climates, but extremely little shallow water and marine climates, which is where life is by far the most abundant.)  Then the equivalent of the Siberian traps form-- massive volcano belts spewing enough magma to maintain a constant lava lake the size of an entire damn continent.  This whole time, methane solids at the bottom of the oceans are melting, which is creating a feedback loop of global warming (and the volcanoes and continental climates/badlands aren't helping matters)  <br />
Ice ages occur when Water and Paraelemental Ice gain dominance in the Inner Planes.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">
