<p>---</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">The Joybloods</span></p>

<p>"I have been asked many times now why I founded this group - or sect, as<br />
people seem to like calling it, for whatever reason. Everytime someone<br />
asks me, I shake my head and wonder what's so hard about understanding<br />
it. The one and only reason is, of course, happiness. It's what life is<br />
about, what EXISTENCE is about.<br />
The Joybloods are yet another attempt at bringing this happiness to<br />
everyone. As I know things in the multiverse aren't as perfect as they<br />
should be, I decided it was important to gather more people working on<br />
right that perfection. I got the idea after a trip to Mt. Celestia.<br />
See, people there tend to be quite happy - they feel safe, and they work<br />
for the good of everyone. Yet, even there things don't run perfect. Heck,<br />
even in Arborea itself things don't run perfect. I've seen two paladins<br />
on Mt. Celestia who nearly killed each other just because of a rather<br />
little difference in philosophical views. And on Arborea, I've seen so<br />
many times that beings were harmed or cursed just because they didn't<br />
pay perfect reverence to a nature spirit. That just ain't right.<br />
Good folk always tell that the creatures of evil are so vile and corrupted,<br />
and want them to get rid of their corruption by following the examples<br />
of the beings of good. But I wonder, if good folk themselves are so<br />
imperfect, how can they truly hope for beings of evil following their<br />
ideals? As hard as it comes to me, I have to say that even good people<br />
are nearly always at least slightly corrupt themselves. And the reason<br />
for this is simple: They lift their own ideals above the one basic thing<br />
that makes life good: Happiness.<br />
That, my friends, is what the Joybloods are about. We want to bring<br />
happiness all across the planes, for that is the only one perfect way<br />
of turning everything in the multiverse to perfect goodness. And no,<br />
I'm not just talking about Arborean happiness. I've seen happy people<br />
in Elysium and on Mt. Celestia, as well as in Ysgard and even Limbo. The<br />
important things are to make sure your own way to happiness doesn't mess<br />
up the happiness of someone else, and that your own way to happiness<br />
doesn't get messed up itself.<br />
Unfortunately, this ideal is extremely hard to reach. Only in a perfect<br />
multiverse, filled with tolerance, understanding and wisdom could this<br />
really be achieved. Until then, there is but one way we can go: Fight those<br />
who try to take other people's happiness away, but attempt to fight them<br />
in a way that eventually makes your foes embrace happiness and goodness<br />
themselves. For example, when fighting tanar'ri (something I have done<br />
many times already), I don't just battle them with all my might. I do<br />
what I can to give them a real challenge, but also leave a chance for<br />
them, even to something as lowly as a manes. And if I win over them, I<br />
don't simply kill them: I let them live, but make sure they understand<br />
how happy - right, how HAPPY - they can be to have survived. I try to<br />
make them understand the value of life.<br />
Of course, in this imperfect multiverse, such an action could lead to<br />
more evil than was intended. After all, a tanar'ri, even one happy to<br />
have survived his last battle, would still go spreading evil afterwards,<br />
right? True, and thus I always make sure that my evil foes don't have<br />
another chance to spread even more evil. As another example, I once<br />
won over a barbazu, wounding him badly but again making clear to him<br />
how barely he escaped true death. I then took him with me and handed<br />
him over to the forces of Mt. Celestia. He was utterly frightened, but<br />
was so aware of how much he treasured his own life that he didn't try<br />
to fight. This was about six centuries ago, and when I asked the archons<br />
of Mt. Celestia the last time, I heard the barbazu slowly started to<br />
learn the lessons of goodness they teach to him.<br />
Trust and understanding, tolerance and hope - that is what the Joybloods<br />
are about. We are a young group fighting for the oldest of ideals. In<br />
the end, everyone searches for only one thing: Happiness. It is our<br />
task to show the multiverse the right way towards it."</p>

<p>- Myharial Blazingstar, Tulani eladrin, founder of the Joybloods</p>

<p>*</p>

<p>Happiness: The basic goal of all life, and the most complex thing in<br />
the multiverse</p>

<p>(Excerpt of Myharial Blazingstar's speech when founding the Joybloods<br />
in Sylvania, hold in the Dipping Dragon Inn)</p>

<p>The Joybloods, my friends, aren't just about partying. I personally<br />
love to party, sure as the Spire, but there's more to life, and other<br />
people like other aspects of the multiverse. If I should say one sentence<br />
to define the Joybloods, I'd choose the following: We've got the task<br />
to battle all things that hinder happiness. This sentence, though, is<br />
far more complex than it seems. No, you don't need to worry, I'm no<br />
Guvner going to analyze every detail now - I just wanna go sure you truly<br />
understand what I mean.<br />
See, many people believe that there can't be happiness without unhappiness,<br />
love without hate or good without evil. It is a quite common concept, but<br />
one that I question. Let's take a love relationship as an example: A<br />
bariaur friend of mine once told me that his first love was strangely<br />
boring, filled with much emotion but little understanding. Only as it<br />
broke up did he realize what he lost, and only now did he truly understand<br />
how much he missed that happiness. Later on, he found another girl, and<br />
he told me that was when he found out about real love. Now, does that<br />
mean that real, deep love can only be achieved after the pain of a broken<br />
love? I say no - I say that it is nothing but insight that lacks here,<br />
true understanding of happiness. It can be achieved by experience, right;<br />
but I ain't no Sensate, and believe that there are also other ways. I'm<br />
convinced that if we truly strive for happiness and joy, working to bring<br />
it to each and every being of the multiverse, we will be able to grasp<br />
its real meaning without the need to lose it first. I believe in the<br />
possibility of true innocence.<br />
Yet, I consider my bariaur friend's experiences very good, as well.<br />
After all, he has felt pain and misery, but instead of giving in to<br />
this, he used it as a key for a greater understanding of goodness and<br />
love. These two concepts are hidden everywhere. We just need to look<br />
for them.<br />
We've got a hard way in front of us, friends. Look at the baatezu; they've<br />
got a whole subrace specialized in torture, the kocrachons. If one falls<br />
into the hands of such a fiend, how shall one still believe in happiness,<br />
how shall one still FEEL happiness? I've experienced that myself once. The<br />
fiend tortured me for about a decade, but he has left not one single scar<br />
on me, be it physical or mental. How did I manage that? By believing, by<br />
hoping. I did not hate the fiend, nor fear it; I just felt pity for it and<br />
its lack of understanding. Every time I could I talked to him about<br />
happiness and love, I made him understand that I would never, ever give<br />
up my hope of getting free one day, and not even my hope that he, too,<br />
would understand one day. Okay, he laughed at me, but half of what I said<br />
already became true. And the more time passed back then, the more I noticed<br />
the kocrachon becoming unsure if he would ever manage to break me.<br />
I realized that the first spark of insight had entered his mind, and that<br />
brought me so much hope that I had a rather easy time standing all the pain<br />
that he brought me. Not to mention that, despite the pain, I enjoyed the<br />
challenge he gave me. It was a test for my physical and mental strength,<br />
and I was delighted to experience I had enough of both not to give up.<br />
I did not enjoy the pain, but I enjoyed that it showed me my own<br />
strength and hope. Oh, and the kocrachon was very confused indeed when<br />
I told him that his torture only strengthened my goodness.<br />
Maybe you've noticed the meaning of my story: What we so often lack for<br />
understanding joy is looking at the details. There is happiness everywhere,<br />
and potential for creating more happiness and joy as well. We have to look<br />
at that, not at the pain and fear. As long as not all is lost - and as<br />
long as we live, we've still got our life -, there is no need for fear,<br />
no need to give up the hope for improvement. Only if the multiverse<br />
might one day blow up all hope is lost; it is our task, our FATE to work<br />
for the opposite extreme. The multiverse WILL not blow up, I'm convinced;<br />
it will become a place so full of joy and happiness that we cannot even<br />
grasp the slightest spark of it nowadays.<br />
There is potential joy in everything; we just need to be able to separate<br />
the dark side of it, and embrace the shimmering white one. And when that<br />
spark of light starts to shine in your eyes, you will be a torch slowly<br />
ablazing all beings in existence with the love and hope that we all<br />
strive for. You will be a real blood, so to say. A real Joyblood.</p>

<p>The Dipping Dragon Inn</p>

<p>Probably the most prominent inn of the gate-town of Sylvania, this<br />
inn is also the place where the Joybloods have been officially<br />
founded. Myharial Blazingstar, the tulani founder, simply went into<br />
the inn during a great party (that is, during a normal day in<br />
Sylvania), and put a strange white candle into one corner of a room.<br />
He then cast a spell, after which the candle was consumed by a<br />
beautiful white flame which became larger and larger until it had<br />
the size of two human men standing besides each other.<br />
Getting quite much attention this way, Myharial climbed upon a nearby<br />
table and began his historical speech, explaining his ideas and the<br />
Joyblood philosophy, answering the questions of anyone nearby, and<br />
taking part in the party at the same time.</p>

<p>The Dipping Dragon Inn consists of a more or less regular building<br />
covered in vine, with its upper floors shaped like a 100 feet large<br />
green dragon, mounted on a pivot and tilting forward and back all<br />
the time. This not only gives the impression of the dragon "drinking"<br />
from a nearby pool, but also makes balance quite a problem for those<br />
inside the upper rooms of the inn. Usually, this is a source of much<br />
fun and laughing, and during the speech of Myharial, it was essential<br />
in taking a bit of the seriousness of the whole situation away, so<br />
not to break up the great party mood in the place.</p>

<p>The inn is relatively old for a Sylvanian building - about fifty years,<br />
as far as people remember. It's owned by the bariaur Filyir Fasthoove<br />
(Pl/male bariaur/Ranger 12/CG), a ranger who's seen more often traveling<br />
the wilderness of Arborea than tending his inn. The latter is usually<br />
done by his former adventuring companion and friend, the halfling<br />
Withir the White (Pl/male halfling/Fighter 7/Sensates/CG), aided by a<br />
half-dozen barmaids (two halflings, three humans and one half-elf) as<br />
well as Withir's son, Chandral, one of the most talented cooks in<br />
Sylvania. Chandral, charmed and fascinated by the ideas of the tulani<br />
Myharial Blazingstar, was the first to enter the Torch of Hope, the<br />
strange white flame within one corner of the upper level of the inn.<br />
Since then, it's Chandral who explains all those interested the dark<br />
of things about the Joybloods.</p>

<p>Chandral Whiteson</p>

<p>Male halfling planar<br />
0-level, cook of the Dipping Dragon Inn<br />
Chaotic Good</p>

<p>Str 12  Int 14  HP    4<br />
Dex 11  Wis 16  AC    10<br />
Con 15  Cha 14  THAC0 20</p>

<p>Equipment: Dagger+2 (forged in Arborea), cooking equipment</p>

<p>Special: Chandral has got the typical Joyblood abilities, and has<br />
chosen the Druid Joyblood ability to purify food and water by touch,<br />
up to twice per day. He currently has 157 Hope Points.</p>

<p>What strikes people first about Chandral is his wild blonde curly<br />
hair, even before the Joyblood's spark in the eyes (see "Joyblood<br />
Membership"). He's an extremely friendly person, so convinced of<br />
the Joyblood concepts that even the presence of a fiend would not<br />
affect his good mood, nor make him really afraid.<br />
Chandral wears light brown leather clothes, though these are usually<br />
hidden under his large creamy-yellow apron. He often brings the food<br />
he's cooked to guests personally, especially if he sees a chance they<br />
might be interested in the Torch of Hope, or the Joybloods in general.<br />
Despite all his happiness, Chandral is a bit lonely, waiting for the<br />
day he might meet the love of his life (which he's convinced will<br />
come to him one day). He's convinced that it's a test of his strength,<br />
although he also has thoughts it might be a test of his abilities<br />
to work for happiness: He's already considered leaving Sylvania for<br />
some time, to search for a girl to share his life with.</p>

<p>*</p>

<p>Within the Ranks</p>

<p>Role-Playing the Joybloods</p>

<p>It would be wrong to view a Joyblood as a simple party-lover. They<br />
might be, right, but it doesn't end with that. One could consider the<br />
Joybloods hedonists of most extreme attitude, seeking the spark of<br />
happiness in even the darkest evil, and working to turn it to good.<br />
They want to enjoy everything they do, the more the better, and they<br />
know how to do it. Looking at the details, actively searching for light<br />
where only darkness seems to be, that's what a Joyblood does; that, and<br />
trying to be such a light himself.<br />
Of course, light is what creates shadows, and the Joybloods know. They<br />
are aware the multiverse isn't perfect yet, and that any action, no<br />
matter how good the intention, can lead to horrible evil. Curing the<br />
wounds of a fiend will most probably lead to the fiend bringing even more<br />
evil to the planes, and that's not what a Joyblood wants. The<br />
Joyblood might still go curing the fiend's wounds if he can, but he'd<br />
want to go sure the shadow created by that action of light is as small<br />
as possible - like handing over the healed fiend to Celestial forces then,<br />
so his soul will be healed as well. The Joybloods live by an attitude of<br />
choosing the least evil combined with the greatest good. Sometimes, the<br />
decisions needed would make a Solar stumble, and the (mainly mortal)<br />
members of the Joybloods don't always decide for the right thing. Yet,<br />
they take a great responsibility for all of their actions. As a general<br />
rule, a Joyblood would always try to make up for any evil or misery his<br />
actions have created, no matter if directly or indirectly.<br />
A Joyblood finding out the fiend they healed now travels the Outlands<br />
devastating everything he finds, the Joyblood would again try to dispel<br />
as much of the darkness he brought as he can. He'd travel to the fiend<br />
himself, hoping to stop the creature, and "convincing" it not to continue<br />
with its evil deeds. In a realistic scene, this would most probably mean<br />
that the Joyblood would give the fiend over to the planeborn forces of<br />
goodness, banish the fiend back into the Lower Planes, or, at worst, kill<br />
the creature. That, though, would be something a Joyblood would only do if<br />
there was no other way of defending happiness against that fiend, and it<br />
would still be an action many Joybloods would regret.<br />
"Regretting" doesn't mean becoming a Bleaker, though. Again, it would have<br />
been a choice of the least evil and the greatest good, and the Joyblood<br />
would still see that his action was another imperfect step in an imperfect<br />
multiverse, a step towards the perfection that still lacks. He would hope,<br />
though, that as soon as the multiverse becomes perfect, all the faults<br />
and wrongdoings would be turned towards light and joy, as that is, in<br />
the end, the fate of existence.<br />
Talking of fate, this sentence can be taken literally. They believe it's<br />
the fate of every little thing in existence to ascend to purity, innocence<br />
and goodness one day. A Joyblood might even see aesthetic sparks in a<br />
Blood War battle field; he pities all those murdered, fallen souls, but<br />
doesn't forget the potential of honor and passion that was shown here:<br />
After all, the fiends here have fought for something (even if it only<br />
was their own life), and that action thus consisted a spark of love, a<br />
love for their own existence, or maybe even for their twisted ideals.<br />
A Joyblood on such a battlefield would not be disgusted; he would shed<br />
all the tears he has on the wasted potential, and gather even more strength<br />
from it, hoping to defend such potential whereever else he can.<br />
Now, the Joybloods are not just about happiness and potential, but also<br />
about tolerance. They believe in the absolute truth of the concept of<br />
Goodness; thus, every concept that embraces Goodness holds at least a<br />
spark of truth. A paladin fighting for innocence and truth is as good as<br />
an artist creating a wonderful poem or picture. A great party has as<br />
much potential for happiness and joy as reading a passionate novel or<br />
diving into the experience of understanding when reading a scientific work.<br />
The perfect Joyblood would love all concepts related to Goodness; but as<br />
the multiverse isn't perfect, it is okay for now to embrace as many as<br />
the Joybloods honestly can. But it's important to keep on searching;<br />
if you've not yet found the joy in chaos, you shouldn't just abandon it,<br />
but instead keep on trying to understand; if you've not found the joy<br />
and feeling of safety and strength that law can bring, it again doesn't<br />
mean it's not there.<br />
Don't think now that means no paladin could join the Joybloods, not<br />
being allowed to embrace chaos. A Joyblood paladin might watch a wild<br />
party from a distance, enjoying the happiness of people over there. He<br />
himself would stay away, though, as he knows he's not ready yet for such<br />
a thing. In this imperfect multiverse, we have to chose the least evil<br />
and the greatest good; if you believe the greatest good lies in law and<br />
goodness, you don't have to give in to chaos. Just don't forget there's<br />
happiness in chaos (and in wild partying), and tolerate it with others.</p>

<p>Alignment. All alignments are allowed for the Joybloods. The first few<br />
dozen members that joined were all chaotic good (as the group was<br />
founded in Sylvania), but as time passes, more and more neutral good<br />
members join. Most beings of evil alignment, and many of neutral<br />
alignment, are rejected by the Torch of Hope, though (see "The Dipping<br />
Dragon Inn" in the Joybloods description). To be accepted, a being<br />
needs to have a real spark of goodness and joy inside, a will to seek<br />
understanding of these concepts.<br />
Members of non-good alignment are restricted in several ways; first,<br />
they don't get any abilities from being a Joyblood member. Second,<br />
all other members instantly know their alignment when meeting them,<br />
due to the initiation ritual. Third, if they ever want to become a "real"<br />
Joyblood, they need to return to Sylvania and enter the Torch of Hope,<br />
and if they have become good by then, the Torch's fire purifies them,<br />
but they do not keep the "Hope Points" they have gathered up to now<br />
(see Faction Membership).</p>

<p>Race. There is no race restriction for the Joybloods, but nearly all<br />
fiends are rejected by the Torch of Hope.</p>

<p>Class. As there is happiness and joy in everything, all classes are<br />
allowed to join.</p>

<p>Joyblood Membership</p>

<p>To become a Joyblood, one needs only to travel to the Dipping Dragon Inn<br />
in Sylvania, the Gate-Town to Arborea. There, the tulani founder of<br />
the Joybloods somehow created the Torch of Hope, a flame of purest white<br />
which burns passionately, but harms neither beings nor objects. It seems<br />
to be impossible to wipe out that flame (some sneaking fiends have tried),<br />
and those who step inside for curiosity are struck back by a weird wave of<br />
heat before they even touch the fire.<br />
Those who enter the Torch because they want to become Joybloods, though,<br />
step inside the Torch and vanish. Noone remembers where he has gone,<br />
but they all come back with a smile on their lips. Those who have at<br />
least a spark of good and happiness inside find a strange, passionate<br />
spark in their eyes, a fiery light that can be more felt than seen. If<br />
they ever decide to leave the Joybloods, though, that spark instantly<br />
vanishes.</p>

<p>Membership Abilities. It seems all Joybloods feel they shouldn't talk<br />
about what they get, or maybe they aren't even aware of it themselves.<br />
If asked, they all answer that what they get is joy and happiness, and<br />
that's more than any faction could ever give them.<br />
There's more to it, though. Even members who've just become Joybloods<br />
are completely immune to all effects that drain hope, be it spells such<br />
as a "Symbol of Hopelessness" or even the hope-draining effects of the<br />
Gray Waste.<br />
Further, being so infused with hope and goodness, they've got a<br />
particular resistance to all effects that bring down their morale,<br />
gaining a +2-bonus to any such throw. This would, for example, affect<br />
any morale checks, saving throws against fear (taking their hope away),<br />
command, suggestion, geas and domination (if forcing them to act against<br />
goodness, or to give up), and all alignment-changing effects (even if<br />
only temporal). It wouldn't affect a spell such as "confusion" or<br />
"imprisonment". If no saving throw is allowed, then the Joyblood does<br />
have a saving throw with a -2 penalty now.<br />
One further advantage for the members depends on each individual's<br />
class; characters with more than one class can chose one. The following<br />
abilities are available (note that, still, the Joybloods aren't aware<br />
of it):<br />
Fighter: A permanent hit point bonus; roll a d4 to determine the<br />
exact hit points.<br />
Paladin: Joyblood paladins can use one of their abilities as if they<br />
were one level higher than they truly are.<br />
Ranger: Slowly understanding that their hated enemies still have the<br />
potential of goodness in them, Joyblood rangers are able to keep<br />
their hatred towards their racial enemies down a bit more. Reaction<br />
rolls in such situations are only adjusted with a -2 penalty, or<br />
not at all if the ranger manages his Wisdom check in each such situation.<br />
Mage: A mage can, once a day, cast a spell as if one level higher than<br />
he actually is, and any saving throws against such a spell get a penalty<br />
of two points. This can only be used, though, if the spell is used for<br />
achieving or defending hope, joy and goodness.<br />
Priests: Priests of powers of hope, joy, and goodness are granted one<br />
more spell of the first level to memorize, while all priests are granted<br />
the ability to heal light wounds once every three days as an innate<br />
ability.<br />
Druids: Members of this class have understood the concept of purity<br />
so much that they can purify any food or water (as per the spell "purify<br />
food and water") by touch, up to twice per day. Also, they can achieve<br />
good alignment without losing their Druid class.<br />
Thief: Believing so much in hope, the Joyblood thiefs get a 5% bonus<br />
to each and every check for a thief ability they have to make.<br />
Bards: Gallant bards are the ones that embrace the concepts of the<br />
Joybloods nearly naturally; if they join this group, they permanently<br />
rise by one level. All bards long so much for life that, whenever they<br />
get reduced to 0 or fewer hit points in a battle, they can fight for<br />
one more round before they fall. If they take more damage than they've<br />
achieved levels before the end of that round, they fall suddenly. As<br />
Gallant bards get this combined with their own abilities, this one<br />
works first, then the Gallant abilities start to function (i.e. they<br />
are considered to having been reduced to 0 or fewer hit points a<br />
round later, and can take even more damage before they fall).<br />
Psionicist: Any psionicist who runs out of psionic power points can<br />
keep his abilities up, gaining as many bonus points as he's achieved<br />
levels, once a day.</p>

<p>Those characters who have joined the Joyblood for some time and<br />
embrace their ideals more and more slowly learn that they do gain even<br />
more abilities, and can even become aware of these ones. Any<br />
Joyblood can gather "Hope Points". Whenever bringing hope and happiness<br />
to other beings without any negative results (DM's decision), he<br />
gains such points. Whenever his actions result in hopelessness or<br />
unhappiness, the Joyblood loses Hope Points. A Joyblood who's got<br />
zero or fewer Hope Points feels the need to go to the Torch of Hope,<br />
where he can purify himself again (if he's still of good alignment,<br />
he's "cleansed" and comes up to one Hope Point again). The following<br />
list can be taken as example for which actions could bring how many<br />
Hope Points; the second listed action is always a negative one, taking<br />
Hope Points away:</p>

<p>Helping a weak person carrying something/Screaming angrily at someone:<br />
1-2 Hope Points<br />
Aiding as a guide through a city/Punching someone without the need for it:<br />
5-10 Hope Points<br />
Catching an evil thief/Stealing money from an innocent:<br />
10-50 Hope Points<br />
Overcoming (but not killing) a minor fiend/Killing unnecessarily:<br />
50-100 Hope Points<br />
Turning a Bleaker into a Joyblood/Turning a Joyblood into a Bleaker:<br />
100 Hope Points</p>

<p>No Joyblood should ever get or lose more than 1.000 Hope Points at once.<br />
The Hope Points can be used for various effects, though each such effect<br />
takes a full hundred Hope Points from the Joyblood:<br />
- An ability check failed; the Joyblood can decide to use Hope Points,<br />
so that he has gathered all the Hope and Passion in himself to succeed<br />
in his task. Each missing ability point costs hundred Hope Points, but<br />
the check is considered succeeded if the Joyblood has enough Hope Points<br />
to spend.<br />
- A saving throw failed that would result in the Joyblood's death; the<br />
Joyblood can reroll the saving throw, but only once.<br />
- A spell of negative effects struck the Joyblood; the Joyblood needs<br />
to spend hundred Hope Points for each level of the spell to maybe<br />
overcome the effect. The Joyblood spends the Hope Points first, then<br />
he makes a wisdom check to see if he's got the insight and understanding<br />
to overcome the forces of magic. For a seventh level spell, for example,<br />
he'd have to spend 700 Hope Points; if he then failed the wisdom check,<br />
the Hope Points would still be lost.</p>

<p>*</p>

<p>The Chant</p>

<p>Since the founding of the Joybloods, the tulani Myharial Blazingstar<br />
has disappeared. Chant has it he's been requested to report to Queen<br />
Morwel, the ruler of the eladrin. As a general rule, eladrin are not<br />
allowed to interfere in the lives of mortals, so Myharial might have<br />
had some explaining to do. But as those eladrin who know of Myharial<br />
and his actions still talk about him with great respect, it seems<br />
he's had some convincing arguments. Most probably that's because he's<br />
not set himself up as ruler of the Joybloods - he's just founded this<br />
sect, giving the mortals another option to understand love and<br />
goodness, but not enforcing anything.<br />
Anyway, Myharial still has not been seen since then, and many rumours<br />
spread to what has happened to him. The most common ideas are that he's<br />
either at the place whereever the Torch of Hope leads to, or that<br />
he's on a secret mission for goodness even greater than the founding<br />
of the Joybloods. Fact is, though, noone knows for sure.<br />
His actions already had somewhat of an impact on the planes, though.<br />
Just a few days after the Joybloods have been founded, a group of<br />
good-aligned folks have gathered in the Hive in Sigil, helping the<br />
weak and innocent for the sake of goodness. They seem to be very active<br />
cutters, and have quickly drawn attention of various groups and people -<br />
some of them good, some... not so good.<br />
Even more fascinating is an adventuring group consisting of four<br />
paladins. Being former members of the Athar, these bashers are convinced<br />
that the Torch of Hope taps into the light of the Great Unknown itself,<br />
and have sworn to spread its light in the Lower Planes. Astonishingly,<br />
these paladins have sworn never again to kill any being, but instead<br />
to try to convert the denizens of the Lower Planes to love and goodness.</p>

<p>*</p>

<p>The DM's Dark</p>

<p>Seems Myharial's philosophies hit a wound or two at some fiends. The<br />
pit fiends Jarrach and Mkaron have given orders to execute any<br />
Joybloods that cannot be subdued one way or another in a short time.<br />
Although this order counts only for their direct servants, many<br />
baatezu have taken this order for themselves in hopes of gaining<br />
a good reputation. The Sigilian crime lord Shemeshka the Marauder<br />
also utterly hates the Joybloods, and seems to have started a<br />
campaign to wipe them out before they grow strong. This young sect<br />
obviously will have a hard start, but as Myharial would state it:<br />
This way, they'll become aware of their own strengths, and their<br />
goodness and love will be proved in practice, instead of merely being<br />
a theoretical idea.<br />
The Athar are highly interested in the Joybloods after a couple<br />
of paladins departed their faction for the sect's philosophies. They<br />
seem to be unsure whether the Joybloods have some secrets that<br />
might prove their own ideas, or whether they should be considered<br />
rivals.<br />
Erin Darkflame Montgomery, factol of the Sensates, has got a clearer<br />
attitude towards the Joybloods: Not only is the Torch of Hope where<br />
the faction's strongest outside of Sigil, but the Joybloods also<br />
deny the importance of bad experiences, taking a naive and childish<br />
do-gooder attitude towards life. She doesn't hate the Joybloods,<br />
but she'd definitely like to see them gone.<br />
The Anarchists have a special hatred for this sect. After all, the<br />
Torch of Hope changes the members so much that it's hard for them<br />
to give the impression of a Joyblood while not really being one.<br />
They need spells to give the illusion of the "spark in the eyes", and<br />
actually up to now they haven't found a really good way to simulate<br />
this spark - it just never really fits. Most Anarchists who try to<br />
fight the Joybloods have chosen a more indirect style, not acting<br />
as sect members, but rather assassinating Joybloods or driving them<br />
out of Sigil.</p>       </div>
