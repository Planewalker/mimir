</div> <p>I am hardly wondering for a quite long time HOW ARE WORKING planes involved with Zakhara' people beliefs?</p>

<p>Let's see. Most important in Land of Fate is obviously belief in rule, force etc. called Fate and that's true, everyone approve that. Things get complex when we are talking about their enlightened deities called Great Gods. They are above manners of alignment, są they are nor good nor evil nor lawful nor chaotic.<br />
Well.. they don't especially involve in cases of mortals as force of Fate does or any other god in neighbor Faerun.</p>

<p>Ok, we have that situation in mind and one Zakharan enlightened person dies. Now.. where does his soul go? Is he becoming a petitioner?</p>

<p>Second edition is quiet about it or so I couldn't find ANYTHING about afterlife in Al-Qadim.<br />
Third edition of D&amp;D, more precisely Player's Guide to the Faerun 3.5 describes two afterlife planes of Zakhara (WTF?):<br />
 - Garden of Delights for good buddies<br />
 - Place of Fire for bad boys</p>

<p>It sounds pretty dull.. and looks like some information filtered through Great Sea from Zakhara to the Faerun, but..<br />
.. well I don't especially like it. It doesn't look like reward for really enlightened creed of honor, family and other arabian culture stuff.</p>

<p>And I SEARCHED. And I found that topic: <a href="forum/list-dead-gods_.html" title="/forum/list-dead-gods">/forum/list-dead-gods</a><br />
list of gods which also contains information about Zakharan gods and their "planes"<br />
<div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div> All of the civilized Zakharan gods dwell in the <span style="font-weight:bold">Place of Light, a demiplane unconnected to any other point in the multiverse.</span> In addition, they also maintain two other demiplanes, connected to the Astral Plane: the Garden of Delights, reserved for their good worshipers; and the Place of Fire, reserved for their evil worshipers.</div></p>

<p>What the giraffe *is* that description meaning? I'm asking about sources, references. What is <span style="font-weight:bold">Place of Light</span> I never heard of?</p>

<p>please answer</p>       </div>

         <p>Oh, I dunno, I think that's some fan-made thing. I copypasted that list from something someone on DiceFreaks made, because the Geocities site that used to host it is gone, and someone wanted to see it. I'm pretty sure I included warnings further up in the thread that not everything there was canon. It's certainly not all how I'd do it. </p>

<p>I'd ignore the "Place of Light" business, personally, and put the Zakharan gods in the standard 17 outer planes of the Great Wheel. No reason they can't be there.</p>

<p>I don't like the idea of "Outer planar demiplanes," mostly. That's what realms are for. </p>

<p>I'd just assign dead Zakharans to the plane that best matched their alignment, honestly. You can also assign Zakharan deities to the plane that best fits their personality (since the gods of the Land of Fate don't have alignments). A few Zakharan gods are Faerunian gods under alternate names; they dwell wherever Planescape says they dwell. If a Zakharan was dedicated primarily to a specific god in life, they can go to that god's realm when they die; otherwise, put them wherever they fit best.</p>

<p>If you wanted, though, the Garden of Delights could be a realm in Elysium, and the Place of Fire could be a realm in the Gray Waste.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I am going to begin by saying that I have never played the Al-Qadim setting, nor do I know enough about it to say for sure what to do with these concerns.</p>

<p>However, knowing a bit about modern Arabic culture, and having done at least a little studying on Sumerian, Mesopotamian, and Persian cultures, I think that Rip is correct that there is nothing preventing the deities from having realms in the current planescape setup - and if you needed them to be secluded for some reason, like if it was necessary to have it separate from the rest of the plane's features, it would be totally possible since the deities can morph the outer planes to their will.  As Divinely Morphic planes, any outer plane is going to be subject to the intention of the divine power that rules that section of the realm.</p>

<p>It would be VERY interesting to see how these realms might differ at least in appearance or composition from the rest of the plane they reside in, but I think for the most part it would be completely possible to incorporate those elements without creating an entirely separate cosmology.  Also, because alignments are a big thing in Planescape but some of the deities have no alignment, they might also be privy to having small demiplanes connected to the Astral Plane, or else take up residence in the outer plane of their choosing - regardless of their (non-)alignment; it could simply be the plane of alignment most closely corresponding to their tenets and faiths.</p>

<p>I have always loved Arabic and eastern cultures...  so much more interesting than the western world's cultures, and much more in tune to the creative spirit of the human individual.  I believe that Dragon Magazine also had an edition which outlined Sumerian deities in some amount...  Maybe that could help as well - at least to give an idea of precedent for the deities specifically from Al-Qadim.</p>

<p>I would love to see a cosmological concept based around Hindu, Buddhist, and/or Persian cultures...  There is so much there that could be really inspirational in the creative sense, and definitely an overlooked niche of D&amp;D religious concepts.<br />

         <p>Thanks for replies, but I have to dissapoint you.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>I'd ignore the "Place of Light" business, personally, and put the Zakharan gods in the standard 17 outer planes of the Great Wheel. No reason they can't be there.
</div>
There is a HUGE reason. As I said zakharan gods are Enlightened. That is really important. They have no alignment because they are above such cases of good&amp;evil, law&amp;chaos. It surely has influence on that they are beyond low-rigid  frames of Outer Planes which generally assign deities to planes by alignment. (but there are always exceptions of the rule).
They <span style="font-weight:bold">aren't</span> normal deities. Their enlightment and non-alignmentness may suggest they are gods above gods. In few places of Forgotten Realms and Planescape there is said about beyond-Multiverse realms of understanding for higher beigns. Have you ever heard of Hinterlands (Player's Primer to Outlands), Far Realm (more "physical" version of odd cthulhu-like existences) or Believers of the Source (they believe in evolution by reincarnation and excellence to become a deity or even more -&gt; beyond Multiverse to achieve greater things which are BEYOND MORTAL UNDERSTANDING!).
In (low-canon, but..) Planescape: Torment you could also meet in one tavern a guy named <span style="font-weight:bold">"O"</span> who learned you a small piece of endlessness, elightment for non-mortal, even non-gods. Small piece of "truth". If gods taste that kind of truth, they decide to leave Multiverse beyond borders, barriers, and seek that another understanding. Seems to be buddhist-like, but it is also part of Planescape and D&amp;D.</p>

<p>There are few known overgods. Lord Ao of Realmspace (Forgotten Realms), Brahman of Vedic Pantheon (Legends and Lore; Planescape).</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>I don't like the idea of "Outer planar demiplanes," mostly. That's what realms are for.</div>
Maybe you don't like it, but remember that <span style="font-weight:bold">many exceptions</span> exist in Multiverse.
- First and most accepted example are elemental lords: Kossuth (fire), Akadi (air), Istishia (water) and Grumbar (earth). They all live on Elemental Planes and in their divine realms their Petitioners also travel.
- another example are Chinish gods. Group of them called 8 Immortals, live in Ethereal Plane in special realm.
- Ptah, ex-leader of egyptian pantheon, left Pelion (layer of Arborea where all egyptian gods once lived in ancient times) for Ethereal Realm
- Anubis became graver of gods in Astral Plane
- Celestian, oeridian gods of stars and traveling also lives in Astral Plane and is considered a patron of Spelljammer voyagers..
- Brahman, vedic overgod about who is said he has all his incarnations as all other vedic gods. Nobody knows where Brahman residents.. Maybe outside *known* Multiverse.
- mamy gods live on Material Plane (like Vecna, Iuz or finnish Hiisi)</p>

<p>Zakharan gods are ALSO specyfic and special. For SURE they cannot live on Outer Planes of Great Wheel. It would make them dull, normal, not special, mundane which they are not!<br />
And they are patrons of every enlightened people. Not only Zakharans, but also those who learn and enlighten themselves by "hearing light of truth etc" <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/wink.png" title="Eye-wink" alt="Eye-wink" class="smiley-content"/></p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>I have always loved Arabic and eastern cultures... so much more interesting than the western world's cultures, and much more in tune to the creative spirit of the human individual.

<p>Al-Qadim has specific gods. On Zakhara, there once were barbarian times with savage gods (these were normal and for sure some of them trully of godly state, lived on Outer Planes). But then there came time of light, honor, belief in Fate, civilisation and truth. Few gods who were barbarian, became enlightened, changed their names, titles and left cases of morality (good, evil, law, chaos). I think they no longer fit to mundane Outer Planes schemes, do you agree?</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>I would love to see a cosmological concept based around Hindu, Buddhist, and/or Persian cultures...

I think I can make you surprise. There are these cosmological concepts. <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/smile.png" title="Smiling" alt="Smiling" class="smiley-content"/> But you have to seek farer than only 3rd edition of D&amp;D stuff.
- Early-hindu mythos called Vedic mythos (from Veda, sacred hindu scripts) are described in Legends and Lore, 2 Ad&amp;D. In Planescape this pantheon of gods is also included and they have their own specyfical cosmology and afterlife. Yes, their gods live on Outer Planes but for example they reincarnate their followers instead of making them Petitioners on planes. <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/smile.png" title="Smiling" alt="Smiling" class="smiley-content"/> This is one of MANY exceptions made in Planescape world. Because these deities have power to do so. And mortal believe and FAITH is power o Multiverse, right? <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/smile.png" title="Smiling" alt="Smiling" class="smiley-content"/> For their followers there is nirvana what is most demanded state, not mumbo-jumbo of any other plane.
- Persian gods etc. were presented in really early and old Dragon Magazine #12. You can download it for example from <a href="http://www.4shared.com/file/187516695/383f45c3/Dragon_Magazine_12_Scans_by_Se.html?s=1" class="bb-url">4shared</a>.
- Sumerian deities are described in Deities and Demigods (1st edition) and much better described in Planescape handbook: "On Hallowed Ground". It describes both Sumerian and Babylonian pantheons and differences between them. (sumerian is more chaotic, natural and wild and babylonian much more concerned with civilization and law)</p>

Nice try, but these gods seem to be truly outside possibility realm of reaching them <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/smile.png" title="Smiling" alt="Smiling" class="smiley-content"/></p>

<p>Also remember: Al-Qadim enlightened gods aren't savage many gods of many tribes before-enlightment times.</p>

<p>In reference to out world: yes, arabian people, tribes had many.. MANY gods. Almost 600 counted by researchers and there are even more. But that wre pre-islamic times. (in zakhara also were pre-enlightment times of mentioned savage deities worshipped only in one tribe or on area o 5 square miles) And then there came Muhammad, there were historical events and Quran and words of truth and other stuff. In Al-Qadim also came time of merging barbarian and conflicted people of Zakhara and made them united peaceful society with no borders, no countries, with codex of honor.</p>

<p>The same situation was made with gods.</p>

<p>So in D&amp;D, persian, sumerian cultures really differ from arabian nights' Al-Qadim game <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/smile.png" title="Smiling" alt="Smiling" class="smiley-content"/> Al-Qadim is another world and of course is FANTASTIC!</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>I'm sorry I'm not more easily disappointed, but I don't think you're right. Faithful Zakharans might feel like their deities are "above" the deities of other cultures, but this is almost certainly just their own ethnocentricity; the gods of Zakhara are simply gods in every other respect. </p>

<p>The Al-Qadim setting is unique among D&amp;D campaigns in not assigning alignments to its deities, but this isn't really a characteristic of the deities themselves, but of the unique way the gods are perceived by the people of the Land of Fate. Some of the Zakharan gods, such as Selan the Beautiful Moon (Selune), the Beast (Malar), and Lotha (Lolth), are almost certainly the same beings as the gods worshiped elsewhere on the world of Toril, where they are given alignments and places in the Great Wheel just as any other gods have. There's nothing that indicates the so-called Great Gods are any more above alignment than, for example, the Cold Gods of the Elements, who are definitely worshiped elsewhere on Toril.</p>

<p>The Zakharan <span style="font-style:italic">gods</span> aren't enlightened (though they're sometimes described that way); the Zakharan <span style="font-style:italic">faiths</span> are enlightened, which ultimately simply means those who practice those faiths tend to think of themselves as enlightened compared to the ajami barbarians of other lands. Their practices differ - they don't assign moral or ethical qualities to their deities, and they don't usually have "specialty priests" dedicated to one god alone - but the entities themselves do all the basic things a deity does in D&amp;D, with no real need to set them apart. Ultimately, it's just Zakharan arrogance at work.</p>

<p>Besides, creatures said to be the servants of the Zakharan gods in the <span style="font-style:italic">Al-Qadim Monstrous Compendium Appendix</span>, the asuras, are very much evident in the Upper Planes of the Great Wheel (in <span style="font-style:italic">Planes of Conflict</span>, indicating that this is probably where the Zakharan gods live as well. The buraq are placed in Elysium, Bytopia, the Beastlands, and Mount Celestia in the Al-Qadim MC itself, showing that those planes are relevant to Zakharans.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Zakharan gods are ALSO specyfic and special. For SURE they cannot live on Outer Planes of Great Wheel. It would make them dull, normal, not special, mundane which they are not!</div></p>

<p>The Outer Planes of the Great Wheel are <span style="font-style:italic">anything</span> but dull, normal, or mundane! The gods of the Great Wheel are wondrous, paradoxical, mythic, mysterious... if they aren't impressive enough for you, I think taking their alignments away isn't going to make them any more impressive (and I think you're playing them wrong). The Zakharan deities aren't credited with any deeds or myths that makes them seem any more "special" than the gods of any other mythos. They're as petty and quarrelsome as any others, and the genies were able to fight them as equals during the time of the Loregiver. They're certainly <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> overdeities (if they were, the genies would hardly have been worthy opponents)! They're worshiped on the world of Toril, which makes them subordinate to the overgod Ao, just as much as any other gods of that world are. Brahman isn't really an overdeity either, but more the collective soul of the Vedic pantheon. </p>

<p>Overdeities are, as a rule, not worshiped by mortals. Overdeities are the gods of gods; they're for other gods to worship. If a mortal worships it, and receives spells, it's probably a regular god. </p>

<p>I don't mind exceptions to the various "rules" in Planescape - gods on the Elemental Planes or the Material Plane or in some unknown region - but there should be a reason for such an exception, and I don't see one that merits putting the Zakharan gods in any place special. They fit fine in the Outer Planes we know, which are about much more than alignment. As described, they're not special enough to deserve a special place to live. They're just gods. </p>

<p>And the Zakharan gods do seem to only be worshiped by Zakharans, and some genies. There are plenty of "enlightened" people on other worlds who've never heard of them. It's only the hubris of the Zakharans that tries to restrict the word "enlightened" to apply to only their own particular cultural understanding of the term.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Ah. You got me.</p>

<p>Asuras and Buraqs are really confusing and I wish they had a little more information about them and their relation (especially Asuras) with Great Gods.</p>

<p>Asura description on Planes of Conflict also has a quote (one of many quotes making reading planescape books funny and ironic) spoken by Zakharan poet-warrior. It also suggests that Asuras from Upper Planes have presence on Zakhara to which there are surely many known to them portals, passages, byways.</p>

<p>It is another confusing thing <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/sad.png" title="Sad" alt="Sad" class="smiley-content"/></p>

<p>And yes, I exalted position of Great Gods insisting they are enlightened and more enlightened than other. Of course overgods by definition cannot be reached by mortal faith, but they were only beigns showing any resemblance to "gods over few and more cases".<br />
<div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>They're as petty and quarrelsome as any others, and the genies were able to fight them as equals during the time of the Loregiver. They're certainly not overdeities (if they were, the genies would hardly have been worthy opponents)! </div></p>

<p>Of course. Great Gods were in very early times normal gods at point of zakharan view. But they did not rejected a Law of Loregiver and thus even changed their titles (can't remember which god, but the changed titles from old ones to present as Kor Venerable etc.). If they aren't considered (and therefore worshiped) equal to other gods, by power of faith they have to differ from other deities even on planes. It plays no matter that egyptian power as Ra worshiped on houndreds of prime-worlds has more followers - more power. It is just case of definining and belief of Zakharan that their gods accepted some really high power above even them. We are speaking about Fate, which has influence (believing game rules) on Zakhara land with neighbor islands. Fate may be considered something more than force, rule or philosophy if it has direct influence (by fate roll ^^).</p>

<p>Of course Great Gods aren't overdeities!<br />
They may have normal powers as any other gods. But they do not seem fit, by means of belief and ideas about them, to be as any other gods.</p>

<p>And even if we could push them on Outer Planes, it is hardly difficult to place them on correct place. Hajama The Courageous for example send blessing on both sacred warriors, paladins and black-hearted assassins. Bravery in heart of every man, both evil and good. Placing then them all on Outlands make me quite laughing.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>They're worshiped on the world of Toril, which makes them subordinate to the overgod Ao, just as much as any other gods of that world are. Brahman isn't really an overdeity either, but more the collective soul of the Vedic pantheon.</div>
Role of Ao is really strange in all Realmspace. Apart from faerunian deities which are conflicted and thus Ao had to interfere a few times, there are also not only Zakharan but Kara-Turan faith. This last one is full of animalistic religion and Zakhara also has Ten Thousend Gods church with animalistic-like belief. And... they also are given spells as clerics. It is maybe due to more liberal second edition of Forgotten Realms, but fact is fact.</p>

<p>Also on Toril, even in 3rd edition it is said that each continent/part of world has it's own different Astral Plane attached to it geographicaly, leading to different places. That would explain religious diversities on this prime world. Even if these differing Astral Planes exists, they maybe are part of that one larger from Planescape of course.. or just Kara-Tur, Faerun and Zakhara and Maztika has it's own portals and conduints which do not mess other regions with their religions, beucase they are not their area of interest and influence of gods/belief.</p>

<p>and mystics, fakirs and kahins..</p>

<p>- Yes. Brahman is believed to be every god of the pantheon. They seem to be really antagonistic between themselves -&gt; in their quest of living all possible lifes in attend to selfimprovement and other nirvana-stuff. In their pantheon also clerics of particular gods aren't priests of Brahman, because he has no priests. But.. choosing to be an ascet makes anybody a real follower and priest of Brahman. In larger view, he could be named one of specyfic overgods.</p>

Mentioned gods are considered savage (Lotha) or ajami, outsider (as Helam or strangely similarly sounding Selan). They have their realms and alignments in FR, in PS as in AQ.</p>

<p>May I quote Land of Fate:<br />
<div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>The Great Gods are neither good nor evil, lawful nor chaotic. They are beyond such matters. Bravery can be found in the most noble faris and the most black-hearted assassin, and who is Hajama to turn his ear from either of them? Individual followers or churches may be good or evil, but the Great gods are above these quibbles. This sets them apart from common gods and heathen deities, who are usually lock-stepped into their believers' alignments.</div><br />
And if such belief exists, what-I-am-talking, it's not only belief, these gods decided themselves to embrace all Law of the Loregiver. Also did genie leaders after they were in quarell with gods in ancient times.<br />
<div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>And the Zakharan gods do seem to only be worshiped by Zakharans, and some genies.

It is a hubris. Sadly. And isolated culture.</p>

<p>Enlightment is just another term for illumination, gaining wisdom. In their culture it sounds like that and is said by their point of view. But thus by infinity of Multiverse we can say that every philosofy, every culture and every belief sux due to multiplity of others. This is belief that shapes the planes, not inverse (maybe?).</p>

<p>But knowledge, law and honor codex was given on from godly beign or something like that. It was given by (even overgodly?) Fate, whatever she (it is strongly suggested "she") is. In their belief Zakharan define "enlightment" in way believing that gods <span style="font-weight:bold">are not</span> ultimate power in universe. This is closely to truth as we know, huh?</p>

         <p>Lunar i can't really understand why you're so confused about this.<br />
If you're playing an Al-Qadim campaign(meaning your party consists of 'primes' from Zakhara)then you treat your gods as enlightened or whatever they are.<br />
If you're playing a Planescape campaign(meaning your party consists of Planar and/or prime characters)then Zakharan deities are no more enlightened than any other power in the Multiverse.<br />
And if you want to bring your party of primes to the Planes then they must learn as all good clueless do that they're beliefs are not the only ones that exist in the Multiverse.<br />
Another thing is i don't think you quite understand what Planescape is all about. You don't quite grasp the vastness and mystery of it...Maybe you should read more about it</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>No, Selan the Beautiful Moon is one of the Great Gods, just as much as Kor or Hajama or Najm.  She's not considered an ajami deity like Helam.</p>

<p>I strongly suspect the designers intended her to be the same as Selûne, seen from a Zakharan rather than Faerûnian perspective, though I can't prove it. But I prefer the idea that Faerûnians worship her one way, as a chaotic good goddess, and Zakharans worship her another, as an "enlightened goddess" beyond alignment. </p>

<p>Lotha's considered one of the "forgotten gods," but no gods are given alignments in the Land of Fate boxed set (I'm not sure about elsewhere).  </p>

<p>I would still put Zakharan petitioners in the same Outer Planes as everyone else. </p>

<p>I think it <span style="font-style:italic">is</span> only belief that the Great Gods submitted to the Law of the Loregiver after their war with geniekind in ancient times, but in Planescape belief is power, and can shape reality. As far as Zakhara is concerned, it's true, but elsewhere other beliefs may have more strength.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

In arabian culture moon is synonym of something beautiful. Read Arabian Nights where beautiful women are described "her face was like a moon."

One thing is to be clueless, second is not to revere powers that have influence. Who knows if Fate cannot reach beyond burning lands of Zakhara? I know no Zakharan warrior who traveled farther than Zakhara, but..
..yes, I know one.
Many Zakharans traveled to Elemental Planes (Sha'irs and elemental brotherhoods as guests and emmisaries on genie courts. Fate also works here as in part of a setting. If not, I will find it mentioned in "Secrets of the Lamp").</p>

<p>These described material worlds are rich and special. Toril, Krynn or Demiplane of Dread, they are important even on Multiverse scale. And their rules in some cases also (powerfull gods for example).<br />

I'm just searching for truth. By canon of course. <br />
<div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Lotha's considered one of the "forgotten gods," but no gods are given alignments in the Land of Fate boxed set (I'm not sure about elsewhere).</div><br />
Also true. Other gods have few sentences of description. Not mentioning alignments, but this is not pointed that savage gods have no alignment for some higher reason.<br />
<div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>If you're playing a Planescape campaign(meaning your party consists of Planar and/or prime characters)then Zakharan deities are no more enlightened than any other power in the Multiverse.</div><br />
They are enlightened in eyes of Zakharans as vedic powers are cool in eyes of hindu people. And that's enough.<br />
Still I'd like to know if such a pantheon may be pushed into these frames..</p>

<p>Defautly I would just tell players that nobody knows where these gods live, but they always are somewhere there (and send spells).<br />
Placing these gods somewhere is important in for example Priests rules on Outer Planes (as reducing level power).</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>I don't think there's any canon indication of where the Al-Qadim gods live, except for what we can infer by where the asuras and buraqs live, or by where possibly identical deities like Selûne live (I don't think the fact that Selan is known as "the Beautiful Moon" is coincidental, even if the moon is also a symbol of beauty). </p>

<p>I'm pretty sure that if the question had been answered in Planescape, they would have been placed somewhere in the Great Wheel, since that's generally where gods were put, with some exceptions. Where there were exceptions, there was generally a good reason for it - i.e., Geb lived in the Elemental Plane of Earth because of his elemental nature, and Io's plane was unknown because his myth said he lived in "the first void" that existed before the multiverse was created.</p>

<p>That said, it's true that there's probably a reason why the designers elected not to answer this question, even in <span style="font-style:italic">Warriors of Heaven</span>, which included just about every other upper planar deity ever mentioned in its list. And yeah, I think that the Great Gods should live in the Upper Planes - the Lower Planes are pretty clearly only a place of punishment in the enlightened faith, so why would the gods lived there? The upper planes are where the asuras dwell. There are plenty of non-good deities who choose to make the Upper Planes their home, for example Zeus, Hera, and Ishtar. But the reason they didn't answer the question officially, I think, is the fact that the Zakharan deities don't have alignments, which makes assigning planes to them somewhat difficult; as well, I'm sure a simple lack of space had something to do with it.</p>

<p>3rd edition did give a separate cosmology to each pantheonic region on Toril (though it says Zakharans and Faerunians share the same elemental planes), but that's not how Planescape did it, and it's not my personal preference. But for what it's worth, the <span style="font-style:italic">Player's Guide to Faerun</span> said the Zakharan deities lived "either on the Material Plane in Zakhara itself or on some other plane unknown to mortals and unreachable from the Material Plane." That's as close to canon as you're going to get. It's not officially called "the Place of Light" anywhere. </p>

<p>Still, one of the themes of Planescape is that "the multiverse has no center," which can be taken to mean that there's no single right perspective on any topic. So the Zakharan perspective - that the home of the gods is unknown and unknowable - is as correct and valid as the Planescape perspective - that the homes of the gods can be visited.</p>

<p>One possibility is to place the gods in the planes I suggested above, and say the Zakharans themselves don't know, and have never reached, the realms of their gods, but that doesn't mean they don't exist.</p>

<p>Personally I would feel free to describe the realms of the Great Gods of Zakhara, and allow player characters to visit them, because that sounds like something that would make for fun adventures, and isn't that the point? I don't think visiting a god's realm necessarily makes the god less unique and special; if the realm is interesting enough, it can make them even more so.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Hm... I read through all few times and I'm still thinking.</p>

<p>Maybe Zakharans truly go on planes by alignment? Well.. then their gods do not reject evil guys. This is extraordinary even when compared to many highly neutral and over-understanding gods who see greater thing beyond good and evil.<br />
Why would black-hearted assassin from sacred order go to lawful-evil plane to suffer when his abilities and <br />
Because it was just wrong and gods also just can be in the wrong? Or they do not reject all believers in the same way for example Mystra doesn't not reject evil spellcasters (what could for sure force them to adjust to shadow weave)?<br />
It is also important part of understanding them.. Or they are not such important for Zakharans?</p>

From the other hand: it is 'only' a prayer. A poem. Something really ephemeral in meaning and description.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Maybe Zakharans truly go on planes by alignment? Well.. then their gods do not reject evil guys. This is extraordinary even when compared to many highly neutral and over-understanding gods who see greater thing beyond good and evil.
Why would black-hearted assassin from sacred order go to lawful-evil plane to suffer when his abilities and
Because it was just wrong and gods also just can be in the wrong? Or they do not reject all believers in the same way for example Mystra doesn't not reject evil spellcasters</div></p>

<p>Zakharans don't usually dedicate themselves to a single god, the way ajami do. They normally worship the pantheon as a whole. So they'd probably either go to their plane of alignment regardless of what god they worshiped, or they'd go to the Place of Fire and the Garden of Delights, again regardless of what god they worshiped. Some few might be sufficiently dedicated to a single deity that they'd get to that deity's realm instead of the plane their alignment would normally send them. In that case, yeah, the alignmentless Zakharan gods wouldn't reject their believers on the basis of their alignments. </p>

<p>While a petitioner in a lawful evil plane might indeed suffer, the plane isn't really *about* suffering. Baator is a reward for lawful evil characters, not a punishment; it can be a painful reward, but gaining the opportunity to maybe eventually become a powerful devil is all the reward a lemure could want.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Al-Qadim is not alone in concerns of Planescape cosmology.<br />
Look at Dragonlance where no one ever imagined Dome of Creation not only ethereal domain of Paladine somewhere in/outside Krynn but it contained everything that exists. No one imagined it would be "only" "small" realm-part of Celestia layer.</p>

<p>Not only novels from Dragonlance present their gods in that way. Spelljammer Krynnspace also speaks of Dome of Creation and other gods (and cosmology of creating Krynnspace by Chaos and gods) much more than any other option of creation. But Spelljammer only "fits" into Planescape. Those two do not reason themselves and others.</p>

<p>same with Zakharans. It seems they go where alignment takes them.<br />
Krynn people, Solamnia knights, Red, White, Black Mages, aquatic elves from ocean and minotaurs from Ansalon, everybody go by alignment into Outer Planes.<br />
Even if those paladins from Krynn becaume planewalkers (as Arwyl Swanson of Mercykillers or female Nagaro also krynnish warrior, ex-paladin, once of Taladas, now of Mercykillers in gate-town Rigus).</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Of course, Dragonlance is kind of a special case because Weis and Hickman say that in the "real" Dragonlance, there is no Planescape (or Ravenloft, for that matter), and the cosmology is how it's presented in Dragonlance; the out-of-world elements were added by others without their approval, and so a lot of Dragonlance fans don't consider them canon.  It's not like the FR situation where they made up a new cosmology to make it independent, and it's honestly a little silly to me because the out-of-world stuff did a lot of neat things (Lord Soth especially was far more interesting with the Ravenloft stuff), but that's how it is.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Still, Forgotten Realms was realeased in first Ad&amp;D edition in 1987. There are mentioned home planes of their gods and that was ok. Planescape appeared much later in 1994, so.. despise it's large reconcstruction it wasn't revolutionary for godly relations of that Prime World.</p>

<p>In Faiths and Avatars (1996) of FR in beggining are described Spheres of Influence of Patheons. And as map suggests Zakharan patheon has all his influence over Zakhara.<br />
But something is interesting:<br />
<div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Disputes between pantheons and even between members of a particular pantheon are usually settled by meetings of the Circle of Powers in the Pavilion of Cynosure on a demiplane floating somewhere in the Ethereal Plane, which is held as neutral ground by <span style="font-weight:bold">all powers active in the Realms</span> and provides an open forum for all parties involved in a dispute. A fundamental principle upheld by all pantheons active in the Realms is the essential sovereignty of a pantheon within its sphere of influence and, consequently, its right to act when threatened by agents of another sphere of influence.</div><br />
Pavilion of Cynosure in my opinion was meeting place only fo Faerunian deities, but it is not pointed that no other cannot go there. "All powers active in the <span style="font-weight:bold">Realms</span>" and if Realms is term for all Toril, not only Faerun, then everly religion (Celestial Beaurocracy, Zakharan Pantheon, Chultan, Mulhorandi, Maztican) can meet in Pavilion.<br />
And then.. our enlightened-gods-without-alignment also can go there and interfere. That states them still among other gods, huh?</p>

<p>In PS, Dragonlance isolation is rationalised (in second edition through 90' years, I don't really know how meta-plot of that world went on, but it changed many times I see) with influence of big evil deity blocking that prime world. In Spelljammer there were no problems (assuming SJ was released nearly in same time as Planescape) with traveling to Krynnspace. Evil deity, whatever it was, Takhisis or Chaos, Krynn gods still had divine realms on planes.</p>

<p>What's more I would say Dragonlance was 'translated' into Planescape with cautiousness.</p>

<p>For example three moons for mages: Lunitari, Nuitari and Solinari are just celestial bodies (in Spelljammer with forests, lakes and life) but in Dragonlance - they are gods. And in Planescape divine realms of these 3 gods are in Ethereal Plane, precisely in Deep Ethereal (in Deep, because, I assume it was time of No Magic on Krynn I suppose and these 3 gods were "turned off" right?). Their realm is Lost Citadel of Magic, where there are three moons, each with it's citadel for god, orbiting on mutual trinary orbit. And greybeards say these moons have link with real moons. Some even say they are one and the same.<br />
[ It reminds me old World of Darkness where Shard Realms (planets) were linked with Shade Realms (magick spheres bounded with particular planet). Shard Realms were real, Shade Realms were in spirit world. ]</p>

<p>In that way DL wasn't <span style="font-weight:bold">so much</span> touched and kicked.</p>

<p>It was PS cosmology made up for Prime Worlds. No otherwise I think. <br />
Same with Zakharan afterlife? What really <span style="font-weight:bold">meant</span> that poet-warrior wanting go to the realm of Asura? What do you think. Are Upper Planes really arabian afterworld?</p>

<p>Well, well, there can still be place of holy assassin on Celestia or Arcadia. There can still be place for Zakharans with passion, living in Istar City of Star and other such stuff?<br />
But what with priests of particular deities? Moralists, Ethoists and Pragmatists?<br />
Better question: what with free priests like kahins, mystics and other fakirs with animalistic religions.. Can they go for their "price" on Outer Planes?</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I'd let them all go to the Outer Planes, yes.</p>

<p>The Planes, as stated in the 2nd edition <span style="font-style:italic">Dungeon Master's Guide</span>, "are without form or dimension." </p>

<p>"Since the planes are without dimension or form, it is possible for different lands in the same campaign world to have entirely different pictures of planar structure and order. For example, an oriental-type world might see the outer planes not as a series of separate regions, but as a single mass throughout which are scattered different agencies of the Celestial Bureaucracy."</p>

<p>What I'm getting at, is that the Great Wheel model of the planes is only one possible view of the mysterious, unknowable multiverse, the view favored by those who live in Sigil (naturally, living in a ring themselves, they see the multiverse as ring-shaped). That doesn't mean it's more "true" than any other view of the multiverse. "The multiverse has no center," says Center-of-All. Sigil is not the center of the multiverse, and the planes are not truly a ring. That is only one way that mortals conceptualize a structure that is truly beyond understanding.</p>

<p>The scholars of Krynn aren't wrong when they say that Paladine dwells "in the Dome of Creation that surrounds all that is." The Dome of Creation <span style="font-style:italic">does</span> surround all that is, in the planar conceptualization that they favor. And <span style="font-style:italic">at the same time</span>, the Dome of Creation is also a realm in Mount Celestia. These two points of view may seem to be contradictory, but they really aren't. It is simply that the multiverse is too vast for any single model to adequately contain it. The Dome of Creation is a realm on a great seven-tiered mountain; it is also a mountain in its own right, on plane with seven mountainous layers; it also surrounds and encompasses the realms of the other Krynnish gods. Which circumstance the traveler perceives depends on what the traveler believes and expects to find. Different travelers can perceive different realities, even if they're standing next to one another. </p>

<p>Similarly, the moons of Krynn are moons, with landscapes and inhabitants, and they are also gods. The gods of the moons live on the Ethereal Plane and they are moons on the Material Plane. All of these things are true. </p>

<p>The multiverse is far more mysterious, far more complex, and far more <span style="font-style:italic">interesting</span> than those of Krynn or Sigil or Zakhara can imagine.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>It depends on your personal preference, of course, but yeah, as we discussed above, <span style="font-style:italic">Planes of Conflict</span> seems to indicate the Zakharan gods dwell somewhere in the upper planes of conflict.

         <p>Well. If gods aren't really achieveable in any setting then it should be so in Planescape.<br />
Ravenloft characters cannot also in Planescape learn smth about Dark Powers. What about gods of Cerilia or immortals of Mystara.. we don't know everything and many rules shape Planescape to fit other worlds. Not reverse I think.<br />

         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>What about gods of Cerilia or immortals of Mystara..</div></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">On Hallowed Ground</span> gave the <a href="encyclopedia/cerilian-pantheon_.html" class="bb-url">Cerilian gods</a> all places in the Great Wheel. For example, <a href="encyclopedia/avani_.html" class="bb-url">Avani</a> dwells in the Gleaming Spire on Mechanus, Sera lives in the Marketplace Eternal in the Outlands, and <a href="encyclopedia/nesirie_.html" class="bb-url">Nesirie</a> dwells in Thalasia. </p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Warriors of Heaven</span> gave the good-aligned Immortals of Mystara places in the Great Wheel, but it generally did a poor job at it. I think the Immortals make more sense in their own cosmology, but they could work in the Wheel. <span style="font-style:italic">Warriors of Heaven</span> put very little thought into its assignations, though, placing some of the Immortals in places that weren't even realms; for example, it placed the hierarch Ixion rather ignominiously in what, if you look up the original module that described the site, is a simple bird's nest. Ixion is the ruler of the Sphere of Energy, and is not a bird. I don't think he'd be comfortable there, even though the bird in question is a phoenix. It's not built for humanoids, or people who like walls and roofs over their heads. There are many problems like that with <span style="font-style:italic">Warriors of Heaven</span>. </p>

<p>Generally, though, I don't think you have to change Planescape's rules very much to fit unusual pantheons in it. The Vedic pantheon, for example, lives in fairly typical realms scattered throughout the Great Wheel. The Believers of the Source and Dustmen believe everyone reincarnates, not just Vedic worshipers.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>(EDIT: Ack! I didn't realize how old this thread was, and I really have no idea why the forums showed it 5th-ish from the top. Sorry for the necromancy, it was really unintentional.)</p>

<p>Sorry for coming into a lengthy thread and only replying to one little thing, but I really feel like I need to say this.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>Lunar</em> wrote:</div>There is a HUGE reason. As I said zakharan gods are Enlightened. That is really important. They have no alignment because they are above such cases of good&amp;evil, law&amp;chaos. It surely has influence on that they are beyond low-rigid  frames of Outer Planes which generally assign deities to planes by alignment. (but there are always exceptions of the rule).
They <span style="font-weight:bold">aren't</span> normal deities. Their enlightment and non-alignmentness may suggest they are gods above gods. In few places of Forgotten Realms and Planescape there is said about beyond-Multiverse realms of understanding for higher beigns. Have you ever heard of Hinterlands (Player's Primer to Outlands), Far Realm (more "physical" version of odd cthulhu-like existences) or Believers of the Source (they believe in evolution by reincarnation and excellence to become a deity or even more -&gt; beyond Multiverse to achieve greater things which are BEYOND MORTAL UNDERSTANDING!).
In (low-canon, but..) Planescape: Torment you could also meet in one tavern a guy named <span style="font-weight:bold">"O"</span> who learned you a small piece of endlessness, elightment for non-mortal, even non-gods. Small piece of "truth". If gods taste that kind of truth, they decide to leave Multiverse beyond borders, barriers, and seek that another understanding. Seems to be buddhist-like, but it is also part of Planescape and D&amp;D.</div></p>

<p>Firstly, what is a "normal deity?" I don't feel like the concept of a "normal deity" has any real place in a Planescape game, but I'm going to assume that by "normal deity" you mean normal by d&amp;d standards, a "d&amp;d deity," a Greyhawk deity or a Forgotten Realms deity, etc etc; and absolutely, Zakharan deities are "different," or are at least worshipped differently, than the deities of most other D&amp;D settings. But this isn't true in Planescape.</p>

<p>As you yourself point out, Planescape is full of other things. The Planescape book On Hallowed Ground even included "non-D&amp;D" or "abnormal deities" like the Greek, Norse, or (especially) Hindu gods. I'd like to draw your attention especially to the Vedic pantheon that was included in On Hallowed Ground. Do you notice anything about them that doesn't really jive with the real-world religion they represent...? Something like how they have alignments? Like how Siva is apparently NE?</p>

<p>Yeah.</p>

<p>If we're going to do this to the Vedic pantheon, there is absolutely no reason for the Zakharan pantheon to be "more enlightened" or "more different" or "more beyond the alignment scale." Things in Dungeons and Dragons, and especially in Planescape, are not really beyond the alignment scale, and if you're really setting out to separate things (gods, characters, outer planes, whatever) from it, I think you're going to have a hard time running a Planescape game.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">
