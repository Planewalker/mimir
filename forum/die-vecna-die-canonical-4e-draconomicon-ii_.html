</div> <p>This is a quote from the Excerpts: Draconomicon Metalic Dragons - Draconic Organizations preview on Wizards.com: "The Guardians of the Gates formed shortly after the god Vecna managed what no deity had ever done: He entered the City of Doors." The article goes on to explain how a Steel Dragon started the organization to watch over portals in order to protect Sigil - and the multiverse - from the danger of another such attempt. This makes at least the Sigil portion of "Die, Vecna, Die!" canonical in 4E, and I at least am using it as my explanation for the changeover in the cosmology from the Great Wheel to the World Axis. (Remember the bit at the end about planes drifting off, etc...?)</p>       </div>

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Kolbold Avenger, I was refering to the adventure's status in 4E, not previous editions! Of course it was canon in 3E; but as everyone here knows (and gripes about), 4E changed a lot of things. Therefore it was an open question until now whether in 4E's retconned cosmology and timeline certain events had still occurred (i.e. the Blood War, Faction War, Vecna entering Sigil, etc...) Until a 4E product comes out that says "yes, this happened", you don't know if they are going to incorperate a particular story element of past editions into the new cosmology or not. As more books came out, we found out that the Blood War did occur but is currenty on hiatus, the Faction War did happen, and so on, but just because something was canonical in 2E-3E doesn't automatically mean that it will be in 4E. Naturally, you can put whatever you like in your own campaign, but here I'm just referring to stuff that is "official" in the sense that WOTC put it in a book. Same as the Faction War being "official" in 2E because it's in a book officially released by WOTC (TSR?)... you see?</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Vecna was never a deity before, but when the 3e PHB came out he was mentioned right there. </div></p>

<p>Vecna's actually been a deity since 1990, when the adventure <span style="font-style:italic">Vecna Lives!</span> was published. He was statted as a demigod there, in full 2nd edition format. He remained a demigod throughout his appearances in the Ravenloft setting (including <span style="font-style:italic">Domains of Dread</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Vecna Reborn</span>, and at the beginning of <span style="font-style:italic">Die, Vecna, Die!</span>). </p>

<p>However, the aftermath of the <span style="font-style:italic">Die, Vecna, Die!</span> adventure had him promoted to the status of lesser deity, where he remained throughout 3rd edition and in 4th edition as well. </p>

<p>The issue that AnimeFan is bringing up, however, is one of continuity. Clearly, 4th edition "core" doesn't share a continuity with 1st, 2nd, or 3rd edition "core." The world is different, the planes are different, many assumptions about races are different: for example, halflings are taller, and half-orcs aren't assumed to be the children of orcs and humans anymore! There are many other examples. For example, in 3rd edition's <span style="font-style:italic">Tome of Magic</span>, the demilich Acererak was said to be a former apprentice of Vecna. We know from his 1st and 2nd edition appearances, moreover, that he's a native of Oerth. In 4th edition's <span style="font-style:italic">Revenge of the Giants</span>, Acererak was a living human only 700 years ago (a period where Vecna was a mere insubstantial shade banished to the lower planes thanks to Kas's attack, no longer incarnate on the Prime and not yet a demigod), living in the nation of Bael Turath (which was part of the 4e core world, a world with among other defining characteristics only a single moon, rather than Oerth). Further, Acererak, as of 3rd edition's <span style="font-style:italic">Tome of Magic</span>, was banished from the multiverse in the wake of his defeat in <span style="font-style:italic">Return to the Tomb of Horrors</span>, left a mere vestige, while in 4th edition's <span style="font-style:italic">Open Grave</span> he's very much present and active in all his demilichy glory, the events of <span style="font-style:italic">Return to the Tomb of Horrors</span> unmentioned. Vecna's nemesis Kas, also left vestiged in his 3e Dragon Magazine appearance (subsequent to the supposedly now-canonical <span style="font-style:italic">Die, Vecna, Die!</span>), is also corporeal and no worse for the wear, his time as a vestige unmentioned. </p>

<p>There's plenty of other differences between 1st-3rd edition continuity and 4e continuity. In 4e, the god Nerull died eons ago, slain by his consort Nera, who would become known as the Raven Queen. As recently as 3rd edition's <span style="font-style:italic">Libris Mortis</span> he was very much alive, however, leaving one to conclude that either 4th edition core takes place eons after 3rd edition core (but how could it, if Acererak was a mortal only 700 years ago?) or the present core continuity is entirely separate. </p>

<p>That's not to say there's no continuity at all between editions. The events of the Faction War are very much evident in the 4th edition DMG II, for example, and Sigil itself seems unretconned except in very minor ways (Zadara's sword archon bodyguards have become maruts). And of course continuity is in full force in the various settings like Forgotten Realms and Eberron, and presumedly also in settings that have not yet been updated to 4th edition like Greyhawk, and perhaps even Planescape exists officially unretconned in some hypothetical 4th edition version of the classic setting that will never see print. </p>

<p>What AnimeFan is bringing to our attention, though, is that 4th edition's core book, <span style="font-style:italic">Draconomicon II</span>, includes references to Vecna's time in Sigil, indicating that at least that part of Vecna's biography has survived the translation from 2nd edition continuity to 4th edition continuity more or less unscathed. While it was indeed true that that adventure was in continuity in 3rd edition (it's mentioned in the "Core Beliefs: Vecna" article in Dragon Magazine), it was more in doubt that it was part of 4th edition core continuity, since <span style="font-style:italic">everything's</span> in doubt in the very different 4th edition core multiverse.</p>

<p>I'm more skeptical that the events of that adventure are a plausible explanation for the many differences between the 3rd and 4th edition core planes, let alone the many differences that have nothing to do with the planes. I'd be skeptical even if the changes were limited to things like the Inner Planes melting into the Elemental Chaos, the Outlands disappearing, and the gate-towns being scattered across the multiverse; Vecna mucking about in Sigil is simply a lame explanation for <span style="font-style:italic">any</span> cataclysmic planar changes, making far too much of a single villain and a single planar city, in my opinion. The scope of the 4th edition differences - the radical (less interesting and fun) differences in the afterlife and the destination of the soul, for example, consigning the majority of souls to some nebulous, unvisitable great unknown instead of the Outer Planes where they might have become a useful part of the game; the differences in the origin, alignment, and appearance of many creatures, the overemphasis on the gods-primordial war back to the beginning of time, shunting unrelated aberrations to the Far Realm, diluting the concept and whole point of that plane... well, even if you buy <span style="font-style:italic">Die, Vecna, Die!</span>'s contention that a single deity who loopholes his way into the City of Doors has the ability to turn the multiversal structure into his Play-Doh, the 4e changes are far in excess of the mere rearrangement that <span style="font-style:italic">Die, Vecna, Die</span> implies, necessitating a massive rewrite of the whole of history. And if history is rewritten, wouldn't the events of the module also be affected? If Vecna's own history and the nature of the world and planes in which he found himself was changed by his own meddling, what you have his a temporal loop with no beginning and end, either his own actions the cause of his ability to act, or his actions rewriting the timeline so that he's unable to act at all... which might mean that the planes didn't change after all. If all of history, from the war with the primordials to the history of Bael Turath to the present, was the result of Vecna changing history in Sigil, then does the multiverse change <span style="font-style:italic">every</span> time the loop runs its course? If Vecna changed things so that they'd <span style="font-style:italic">always</span> been the way they are now, as 4th edition core says they were, then the last time he entered Sigil they should have changed <span style="font-style:italic">again</span> (because we've established that that's what Vecna being in Sigil <span style="font-style:italic">does</span>), and as history flows back toward the present he'd change it yet another time, histories and continuities flickering and blurring together with no end until someone finally gets sick of it and keeps Vecna <span style="font-style:italic">out</span> of Sigil. Only then can history stabilize, presumedly in its original form. Of course, if history's back to the way it was before then Vecna must have gotten into Sigil after all, so maybe nothing, not the might of all the gods and overpowers, can ever prevent the multiverse from spiraling into an infinite loop of paradox. That is, if we believe that Vecna's entrance into Sigil rewrites history and it isn't that 4th edition core simply has a completely separate continuity from 3rd edition core whose existence has nothing to do with Vecna.</p>

<p>That is to say, <span style="font-style:italic">Die, Vecna, Die!</span> can't be canonical because <span style="font-style:italic">nothing</span> can remain canonical as long as Vecna keeps getting into Sigil, changing the canon every time he does so. In the 2nd edition continuity, Vecna's entrance created the 3rd edition continuity. In the 3rd edition continuity, Vecna's entrance created the 4th edition continuity. In the 4th edition continuity, which is presently in force, Vecna's continuity-changing powers must therefore have created the 5th edition continuity and so on, ad infinitum. Unless you've figured out what the ∞th edition multiverse looks like, figuring out exactly what changes Vecna could have made is hopeless.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Quite correct.  The staff of 4E core obviously decided "you know what?  To hell with continuity!  We're making the mechanics of 4E completely different from the previous editions, so we might as well make the fluff completely different as well.  Plus it saves us a lot of work having to reference all the old materials!"  The whole Vecna thing is just a lame, half-assed Deus-Ex Machina to cover their  (the 4E core staff's) butts.</p>

<p>""And of course continuity is in full force in the various settings like Forgotten Realms and Eberron""<br />
That's only because the guys in charge of those settings (Ed Greenwood and whoever is in charge of the Eberron campaign setting) are not the same guys as the ones responsible for 4E core.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>The whole Vecna thing is just a lame, half-assed Deus-Ex Machina to cover their (the 4E core staff's) butts.</div></p>

<p>To be clear, the 4th edition core staff isn't claiming that the 4th edition cosmology is different because of Vecna. That was AnimeFan's idea. And it's fine, I suppose, if all he wants to change is the cosmology rather than the continuity as well. I just thought the idea of an infinitely looping retcon was funny.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>That's only because the guys in charge of those settings (Ed Greenwood and whoever is in charge of the Eberron campaign setting) are not the same guys as the ones responsible for 4E core.</div></p>

<p>I'm not convinced of that; I think it's the same design staff across all D&amp;D lines, although obviously some designers work on some products and some on others. I know Ed Greenwood isn't in charge of the Forgotten Realms; he sold the rights back in 1987 or so. He's just a freelancer, albeit one who gets a lot of opportunities to design for the world he created. Still, the current direction of the Forgotten Realms, with the Spellplague and all that, was the decision of the Wizards of the Coast R&amp;D staff, not Ed Greenwood. </p>

<p>James Wyatt worked on all three of the first 4th edition core books, and he also co-wrote the 4th edition Eberron Campaign Guide. Again, Keith Baker is just a freelancer, not really "in charge" of the setting since WotC bought it from him. </p>

<p>I think the WotC R&amp;D staff simply decided that campaign worlds should retain previous-edition continuity, but that core products didn't have to. </p>

<p>That said, some of the core assumptions that have changed (for example, aasimar are devas now, and eladrins are another name for high elves) have changed elements of Forgotten Realms and Eberron canon too. It's just that they're making an effort to retain what continuity they can in the campaign worlds, where in the core products this is less true.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

In PHB2 there's a paragraph on possible origins, which includes Human and Orcs tribes intermixing, the spawn of Gruumsh's blood shed when he lost his eye, a Hobgoblin project to create supersoldiers from Humans and Orcs, or that Kord created them wanting a race that had the best qualities of both as possible origins of Half-Orcs.  Ending with the fact that most Half-Orcs really don't like those sort of questions about their race, and will probably punch you in the face if you ask.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>It sounds like it's not as formal as you're assuming it is.  From the description Anime Fan said, it sounds more to me to be an informal organization of dragons that have agreed to keep an eye on Sigilian portals to keep something like the Vecna situation from happening again, like an adventuring guild specifically devoted to watching out for threats to Sigil that just happens to be made up mostly of dragons.  Not any sort of formal arrangement with the city government or anything.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Well... there's a lot I don't like about 4E, and I fully agree that the 4E version of the planes and the afterlife is much less interesting than the Planescape version.  However... I have to say that one thing I do like is that the 4E designers followed continuity better than the 3E designers when it comes to Sigil itself (even if they did mutilate the rest of the multiverse).  Sure, there are some slight continuity glitches, like the fate of the Shattered Temple... but 3E pretty much ignored the Faction War altogether, and even had the temerity to assign an alignment to the Lady of Pain.  4E, on the other hand, seems to have done pretty well by the City of Doors.  Pity about the rest of the multiverse, though...</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

Sure, there are some slight continuity glitches, like the fate of the Shattered Temple... but 3E pretty much ignored the Faction War altogether, and even had the temerity to assign an alignment to the Lady of Pain.  4E, on the other hand, seems to have done pretty well by the City of Doors.

<p>What, seriously?  I can't think of a single 3e source that <span style="font-style:italic">does</span>.</p>

<p>Okay, I admit I'm going by memory here... I just moved, and my books are still boxed up and not easily accessible right now.  And it's very possible I'm remembering this wrong, in which case I welcome corrections.  But as I recall... Sigil was mentioned in very few 3E products to begin with, and all those that did stated or implied that the factions were still in control there.  I think (though again I could be misremembering) that the <span style="font-style:italic">Planar Handbook</span> made the matter of the factions running Sigil explicit&mdash;though, admittedly, it did have a prestige class for the Mind's Eye, which only existed after the Faction War, so I guess it can't really be accused of ignoring the Faction War altogether.  Don't recall off the top of my head what's said about Sigil in the 3E <span style="font-style:italic">Manual of the Planes</span>.  I do, however, seem to recall an adventure, too&mdash;<span style="font-style:italic">Lord of the Iron Fortress</span>, I think?&mdash;that made the Mercykillers out to be still very much intact, contradicting the faction's fate at the end of <span style="font-style:italic">Faction War</span>.  (Sure, even after the Faction War there may have still been a few strays about who still claimed to be members of the "original" Mercykillers faction instead of the Sodkillers or the Sons of Mercy that it split (back) into... but the module made the Mercykillers out to be still a major player and seemed to be convinced they were still just as powerful and just as much a united faction as they ever were, not acknowledging the events of the Faction War at all.)</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Also, I still don't understand why people are so up in arms about the Lady getting an alignment.

<p>This is a matter of opinion, obviously, but in my opinion... yes.  Yes it does.  Her political concerns and her past deeds are "fluff".  Alignment is a <span style="font-style:italic">game statistic</span>.  A game statistic with some role-playing implications, a game statistic that corresponds to something characters may actually refer to in-game, sure, but a game statistic nonetheless, and giving the Lady of Pain <span style="font-style:italic">any</span> concrete game statistics is a step in the wrong direction.  Sure, it's nowhere near as bad as if they'd, say, given her 40 hit dice, a Fort Save of +20, and the spellcasting abilities of a 30th-level sorcerer... but it's still a very different thing from stating her concerns about the rising power of the Indeps and the actions she took in response.</p>

<p>Like I said, my opinion.  Your mileage may (and apparently does) vary.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>The <span style="font-style:italic">Planar Handbook</span> did mention the Faction War! Page 144:</p>

<p>"A few years ago, though, the political strife turned physical, and the streets ran with the blood of the Faction War. So the Lady decided to start over again. As commandments go, it was a simple one, delivered to the leaders of each faction: "This city tolerates your faction no longer. Abandon it or die. Opinions varied as to what exactly the Lady meant by that, but everyone paid attention. Three of the factions simply disbanded, ceasing to exist. Six more moved out of town to other locations, there to keep preaching their beliefs to all who'd listen. And six more remained in Sigil but gave up on anything resembling an organization. Whether those six were the bravest - deciding the Lady meant "no factions" but not "no beliefs" - or just the foolhardiest is open to question."</p>

<p>The Faction War was also mentioned prominently in <span style="font-style:italic">Expedition to the Demonweb Pits</span>.</p>

<p>As for Mercykillers in Rigus, I'd think it was weirder if the faction across the infinite planes instantly disintegrated just because their membership in Sigil did. What would they care in Rigus about Sigilian politics? They've got their own centuries-old organization with no reason to fear the Lady or her edicts.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>What, if anything, did the 3E <span style="font-style:italic">Manual of the Planes</span> say about Sigil and the factions?</p>

<p>Don't entirely agree about the Mercykillers in Rigus... as I said, I can certainly see some factioneers still claiming to be Mercykillers despite the faction's official dissolution, but I still think it should have had more effect than the adventure made it seem.  Especially in a place like Rigus, which is an important gate-town, not some backwater that would have taken a while to get the news.  Still, I see your point, even if I don't entirely agree with it, so maybe we can agree to disagree here.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>The Lady of Pain was listed as lawful neutral in the <span style="font-style:italic">Planar Handbook</span>, exciting great controversy among fans on the internet. </p>

<p>I think there's a case to be made for the Lady as an evil character, actually, though only a case; much better to leave it ambiguous. But that's why I would have disliked it even if they had given her a true neutral alignment; I like leaving it uncertain whether she's an objective caretaker or a malevolent tyrant. That ambiguity is important to me, and I don't like a book stating outright, "she's not that bad, really."</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>OK, here we go.  Haven't dug my 3E books out of storage yet, but I also have PDF copies, and I've taken a glance through them.</p>

<p>It's the <span style="font-style:italic">Manual of the Planes</span> that says the factions are in control of Sigil:<br />
<div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Sigil is controlled by a number of factions, all of which may be politely described as 'philosophers with clubs.'  These factions break down along the lines of traditional alignments and control different parts of the city and different services within.</div><br />
That, of course, describes the situation <span style="font-style:italic">before</span> the Faction War.  I knew there was some 3E source that described Sigil as if the Faction War had never happened; I'd thought it was the <span style="font-style:italic">Planar Handbook</span>, but clearly I had misremembered&mdash;I guess there was enough I didn't like about the <span style="font-style:italic">Planar Handbook</span> that I assumed that must have been in there too, but it wasn't.</p>

<p>(Sigil is also described briefly in the <span style="font-style:italic">Epic Level Handbook</span>, but there, while it says nothing about the Faction War, it says nothing to imply it didn't happen either, so that doesn't really weigh in one way or the other.)</p>

<p>So... yeah, clearly I overstated the case about 3E ignoring the Faction War.  There were indeed some 3E products that contradicted its events (the <span style="font-style:italic">Manual of the Planes</span> and (at least arguably) <span style="font-style:italic">Lord of the Iron Fortress</span>), but I'd forgotten there were also others that acknowledged them (the <span style="font-style:italic">Planar Handbook</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Expedition to the Demonweb Pits</span>).  So yeah, 3E's treatment of the Faction War wasn't as unanimously negative as I'd remembered; it was just inconsistent.  Still think 4E's treated Sigil better overall, though, although, again, I certainly can't say the same for the rest of the planes.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Oh, my... I hadn't thought of that! I suppose, though, that for a solution you could claim that THIS time around Vecna got booted out of Sigil before he could turn the 4E cosmology into whatever the 5E planar arrangement will be... otherwise, an endless loop as you stated. Although Vecna enters Sigil both in 2E-3E and in 4E, perhaps slight differences along the way allowed Vecna to be kicked out of Sigil this itteration at an earlier stage of the game, thus saving the 4E multiverse. (After all, there'd bound to be a lot of minor differences in the sequence of events each time; I assume you've heard of the so-called "butterfly effect"?) As for the infinite loop, it's possible that Vecna could muck up things so much as to erase himself from history, thus ending the loop...</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Arguably, if Vecna is ever prevented from changing the cosmology, then the "first cause" that created the 4th edition (and 3rd edition) cosmology in the first place is eliminated, and everything is reset in its 2nd edition form (or perhaps even 1st edition or earlier, if you want to blame Vecna on that too).'</p>

<p>My own preference, if you're looking to change the nature of the planes while retaining previous-edition continuity, would be to use the Tempest of Doors during the Faction War as an excuse. During that time, all the portals in Sigil were rearranged. What if, when they were reopened, they opened paths to different cosmologies as well as planes and worlds? That seems like the simplest and least ugly solution.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Yeah, I've got to agree with Anime Fan's interpretation, then.  That sounds like it's the organization that's been around for centuries.  Either that or they happened into an existing map of portals, but it really sounds like the map's supposed to be the Guardians' creation.</p>

<p>Has there been any word about them advancing the Planescape timeline that far like they did with FR?  Maybe it's just poor choice of wording on the part of the author, but maybe they are doing that.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>The version of Sigil described in the DMG II (and <span style="font-style:italic">Kingdom of the Ghouls</span>) pretty clearly takes place only a few years after the Faction War.</p>

<p>The mistake here is in thinking there's still a Planescape to <span style="font-style:italic">have</span> a timeline, or that 4th edition core materials are trying to present a coherent setting in different books. The whole point of 4th edition "core" is that there's no fixed canon that designers are obligated to pay attention to. Instead, there's just a bunch of proper nouns that they can use however they like. The task of the reader, then, is to choose what they like and ignore the rest. There's no 4e "canon" in the core books. Planescape, which <span style="font-style:italic">does</span> have a canon, always trumps it. </p>

<p>As far as authorial intent goes, the authors of the Draconomicon II apparently decided to set that book centuries after the events of <span style="font-style:italic">Die, Vecna, Die!</span>, while the authors of the DMG II decided to set that book only a few years after the events of <span style="font-style:italic">Faction War</span>. The best assumption, then, might be that the <span style="font-style:italic">Draconomicon II</span> takes place centuries after the DMG II (and the events of <span style="font-style:italic">Kingdom of the Ghouls</span>. There's no reason to assume that the <span style="font-style:italic">Draconomicon II</span> and DMG II are contemporaneous just because they were published in the same year. There are no references in the <span style="font-style:italic">Draconomicon II</span> to NPCs, events, or locations mentioned in the DMG II other than Sigil, Vecna, the Lady of Pain, and the Market Ward, and all of those things could and presumedly do exist centuries later.</p>

<p>At the time in which the DMG II is set, then (approximately 7-9 years after the Faction War, perhaps, if we go by the amount of time that's passed in 3e, or perhaps assume a little more time has passed since the end of the 3e era) the Guardians of the Gates are just getting started, and probably are made up of only Virtraxentyr and his immediate family. They haven't yet become the plane-spanning, multi-racial organization they'll be in the centuries to come.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Ohh, okay.  I was assuming that this was supposed to be a pre-tie in/reference to the 4e Planescape release that so far as I know is still eventually planned.  Last I heard, it was going to be one of the annual settings eventually, and I just figured this was sort of "foreshadowing".  This and the DMG2 Sigil.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>I doubt that's going to happen, personally, but my information's no better than yours. </p>

<p>With the planes thoroughly integrated into the core setting (and two hardcovers detailing the core planes still to come) there's really no "setting" for a Planescape setting book to describe. They clearly have no intention to describe the 2nd/3rd edition planes in any detail (they'd have to radically change both the fluff and in some cases the statistics to too many monsters, and it's just not worth it - all 4e campaign settings use the 4e planes). There's room for a 4e Planescape Player's Guide describing the factions, guilds, and other elements, and I'd love to see that, but I don't know what they'd put in a Planescape Campaign Guide.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Ripvanwormer, I have to take issue with your claim that 4E has no canon - it certainly does, as many articles reference the unnamed "world" that the default campaign occurs in, as well as consistent and ongoing articles about the gods and planes of 4E. A single mistake by one author does not prove that WOTC doesn't care about having a canon in 4E materials. Yes, that canon is inconsistent with pre-4E materials, but not with itself. WOTC is slowly but surely building on everything they have established in 4E so far, adding new details as they go along. Maybe in 4E Vecna DID enter Sigil before the Faction War - there's nothing written in 4E prior to this that would exclude it. (Yes, this contradicts 2E/3E, but not anything written in 4e, which is the point I'm getting at.) They are re-using the old names and situations from previous editions, but they aren't just "throwing them out" at random... at least, that's how I see it.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I agree with Anime Fan.  4E is Canonical with 4E.  I view it as an entire retelling of the story.  Just like the xmen cartoon isn't canonical with the xmen comics or the xmen movies.  It's a different version.</p>

<p>Ok, with that out of the way, here's a question for 4e players.</p>

<p>The guardians of the gates seems like the sort of group that would be very much involved in the adventure in the back of the DMG2.  But the group that hired the PCs is the Planer Trade Consortium.  Anybody use this adventure and try to work them in?  Unfortunately, I've already run most of it, but if I had to do it over, I would have beefed up the second encounter and had a steel dragon fly in to help out.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Ripvanwormer, I have to take issue with your claim that 4E has no canon - it certainly does, as many articles reference the unnamed "world" that the default campaign occurs in, as well as consistent and ongoing articles about the gods and planes of 4E. A single mistake by one author does not prove that WOTC doesn't care about having a canon in 4E materials.</div></p>

<p>As I understand it, the entire point of using a generic, unnamed, largely unmapped World in 4th edition core - rather than having the Forgotten Realms or Eberron be the core world - is to avoid bringing along a "canon" that would weight down designer creativity. The whole point of the setting is that it's just a bunch of proper nouns that can be used any way the DM wants - I mean, obviously it's more than that sometimes, but it isn't a <span style="font-style:italic">setting</span>. It's been fleshed out in places, and there's some attempt at consistency, but it's not entirely consistent, and doesn't really try to be. </p>

<p>For example, Dragon #372 has an article on Bane that says he was born fully-formed, as a god, with two brothers, Kord and Tuern, and none of them had any parents. <span style="font-style:italic">Divine Power</span> gives us an alternate, contradictory series of myths in which Bane was a mortal king who killed Tuern and took his place in the heavens, while Kord was the son of Khala, the goddess of winter. Contradictory, right? But individual groups can use either myth or both myths simultaneously in the same game - 4th edition makes no attempt to give us a single, "canonical" truth.</p>

<p>As another, better example, the 4th edition <span style="font-style:italic">Monster Manual</span> describes the lich-queen Vlaakith as if she's still alive, and <span style="font-style:italic">Draconomicon 1</span> not only says she's still alive but makes it sound as if she's the very first queen named Vlaakith. Dragon #377, which folds in all the continuity from the <span style="font-style:italic">Incursion</span> storyline in Dungeon #100, makes it clear that Vlaakith CLVII (explicitly the 157th queen to bear that name) has been dead for 25 years, replaced with the Emperor Zetch'rr. This article, which is tied to the <span style="font-style:italic">Scales of War</span> adventure path, is very much 4th edition and the World Axis cosmology, but dares to either contradict an important part of 4e canon, or - at the very least - to take place 25 years after the period described in the <span style="font-style:italic">Monster Manual</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Draconomicon 1</span>. So, at the very least, time is mutable across 4th edition products.</p>

<p>There are no dates or clues in the <span style="font-style:italic">Draconomicon 2</span> that would make it clear when it takes place. It certainly could be that they're implying that Vecna entered Sigil centuries before the Faction War, but as that particular book doesn't even mention the Faction War, that's not at all clear. If that was their intention, that would contradict the assumption that it makes <span style="font-style:italic">Die, Vecna, Die!</span> canon for 4e, since many of the characters and situations in <span style="font-style:italic">Die, Vecna, Die!</span> are pretty particular to that time and place. Absent any specific information in the book itself, though, I'd assume that previous canon holds and therefore <span style="font-style:italic">Draconomicon 2</span> must take place centuries after the <span style="font-style:italic">DMG 2</span> - or, as you suggested earlier, that the Guardians of the Gates found an already-existing portal map that had been developed over the period of centuries. Obviously, individual groups can and will play it differently - as I said, the point is they're not trying to define these things for us - but in trying to make sense of the totality of information available on these things, that's the conclusion I would come to.</p>

<p>I don't think there's ever going to be a formal timeline explaining exactly when Bael Turath fell, when Vecna became a deity, when Gith rebelled against the illithids, or any of the other "core" events. That would be something you would do in an actual campaign setting, and that's not what the core World is. </p>

<p>I won't deny that they're "retelling the story" in a different way than previous editions told it, but my point is that they're not trying to be a setting in themselves. If you want a consistent campaign setting, you can buy Forgotten Realms or Eberron. The core books are meant to be just placeholders, mostly, which are designed in such a way that most of the core details can be easily transposed into those deeper, more canon-heavy settings.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Gee, I guess I owe you an apology then, Rip... I was unaware of those online articles, since I don't subscribe to D&amp;D Insider. I was just going by what was in the hardcover books. Of course, Powers sometimes do have contradictory myths written about them, even in earlier editions (i.e. is Sehanine Moonbow Correlon's wife or daughter? Or both?) It will be interesting to see if Vlaakith is dead in The Plane Above, or still alive (sort of!) and kicking. I hope they keep her in, since I want her stats and she's cooler than the guy that knocked her off. It would suck if they replaced her in the hardcover book!</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>My guess is she will be, since she's alive in the <span style="font-style:italic">Monster Manual</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Draconomicon 1</span>. I think the "Vlaakith is dead" storyline is limited to the Scales of War adventure path (and the Incursion storyline that it's explicitly a sequel to). </p>

<p>It's an interesting story, though.</p>

<p>Arguably the Sigil material in the <span style="font-style:italic">Dungeon Master's Guide 2</span> is part of 4th edition Forgotten Realms canon, since Sigil has been mentioned in FR books in 2e and 3e and 4e Forgotten Realms retains previous-edition canon, and because one of the characters in the DMG2 is explicitly from Toril. So as far as the Forgotten Realms is concerned, Vecna invaded Sigil <span style="font-style:italic">after</span> the Faction War. Then again, as far as the 4th edition Forgotten Realms goes, the Faction War happened over a hundred years ago.</p>

<p>I suspect the reason why they seem to imply it was centuries ago in the <span style="font-style:italic">Draconomicon 2</span> is that Vecna's time in Sigil was the point where he first rose from exarch status to lesser deity, and they don't want to portray Vecna in 4e as if he's only been a true god for a few years. I don't think it matters, personally, since he was a demigod for centuries before that and has had an active cult since his mortal days, but that's probably their reasoning.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>"Then again, as far as the 4th edition Forgotten Realms goes, the Faction War happened over a hundred years ago." Sorry, Rip, but that would make Arwyl Swan's son one VERY old codger, and I doubt that was the author's intent. While the timelines for Forgotten Realms, Greyhawk, and Sigil could be neatly matched up in 2E and 3E, that isn't the case in 4E (example: Toril's timeline has been brought forward 100 years, whereas Ebberon's was not brought forward to match.) So most likely in 4E Forgotten Realms the Faction War happened only a few years ago, but AFTER the Spellplague, Mystra's "final" death, etc... So in 4E Arwyl either came from the current Toril, set 100 years beyond 2E/3E, or else he is in for a MAJOR shock if he ever returns to Toril - everyone he knew is likely long dead... in previous editions, a year spent in Toril equaled a year spent in Greyhawk, Sigil, etc... but in the new edition planewalkers may discover that they have inadvertently become timetravelers as well!!!</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Sorry, Rip, but that would make Arwyl Swan's son one VERY old codger, and I doubt that was the author's intent.</div></p>

<p>Well, sort of. Since the <span style="font-style:italic">Dungeon Master's Guide 2</span> takes place only a few years after the Faction War, it takes place around 100 years before Sigil's current state in Forgotten Realms canon. Arwyl Swan's Son forms the official link between the two settings (the "core" Sigil and Toril), but just because he's a 4th edition character and from Toril, that doesn't mean he's from Toril in the present day. </p>

<p>I cited him in part to show how different 4th edition products can take place on different times in the timeline. The Forgotten Realms is set around a century after Sigil as it's portrayed in the DMG2.</p>

<p>That said, Arwyl Swan's Son makes an appearance in the 4th edition Mercykiller article in Dragon #370, and he <span style="font-style:italic">is</span> portrayed as a "very old codger." In that article, he's 150 years old. He owes his long life to a blessing from Torm.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>So most likely in 4E Forgotten Realms the Faction War happened only a few years ago</div></p>

<p>What? No. Toril already has a canonical match-up with Sigil's timeline thanks to the <span style="font-style:italic">For Duty &amp; Deity</span>-<span style="font-style:italic">Tales From the Infinite Staircase</span> crossover, and Forgotten Realms canon hasn't been "rebooted" with the change in edition. Previous edition canon still holds in the Forgotten Realms unless specifically contradicted, which is my other main reason for mentioning Arwyl Swan's Son. </p>

<p>So 1370 DR is equivalent to 130 in Hashkar's reign, and the present date in the Forgotten Realms campaign is 1479 DR, or 109 in the Lady's Edict calendar. If he was around 41 in 1370 DR, he's be 150 now, which makes it sound like the article in Dragon #370 was set to Forgotten Realms time. </p>

<p>Perhaps the <span style="font-style:italic">Draconomicon 2</span> was set to Forgotten Realms time as well. </p>

<p>However, there isn't much else in that article that indicates a full century has passed between editions. It's clear that it's been at least several decades, since Alisohn Nilesia's daughter is the leader of the Sodkillers, but I don't know for sure it's been precisely a century. It could have been, though, and my guess is that's what Robert J. Schwalb intended, if only because the Forgotten Realms time jump was the only indication at the time of how much time should have been assumed to have passed between editions, and any other assumption would be completely arbitrary.</p>

<p>Well, that's not entirely true. It could take place around 25 years later, during the time period described in the <span style="font-style:italic">Scales of War</span> adventure path. <span style="font-style:italic">Incursion</span> was probably around 1373 (given that Dungeon adventures published at the time are assumed to take place in 593 CY Greyhawk time), so the current date in this case is probably 1398 DR, or 28 Lady's Edict.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>So in 4E Arwyl either came from the current Toril, set 100 years beyond 2E/3E, or else he is in for a MAJOR shock if he ever returns to Toril - everyone he knew is likely long dead...</div></p>

<p>Well, no, either way he left Toril well before 1370 DR. Dragon #370 said he lived on Toril "long ago." <span style="font-style:italic">The Factol's Manifesto</span> said he first came to the Outlands as a young paladin, so he was probably in his twenties, so he probably arrived in the Outlands around 1350 DR (or around 1268 DR, if you're using the Scales of War date). If the current date is 1479 DR, he's been in Sigil for well over a century, and he's perfectly aware of how much time has passed since he's lived on his home world, and wouldn't expect any other humans he knew in the old days to still be around. Of course, he probably knows a few stable portals to Toril, so he's likely been visiting periodically over the decades, catching up on old times and seeing his family on holidays.</p>

<p>My point is that, due to the canonical connections with the Forgotten Realms, Sigil's timeline hasn't been rebooted, and previous canon holds - at least, in the Forgotten Realms campaign it does (for someone playing Eberron, everything's fair game). There are <span style="font-style:italic">some</span> changes, but only those changes specifically mentioned are considered canon.</p>

<p>I don't think it's impossible for portals in Sigil to also be portals through time (and perhaps that's another explanation for the Vecna issue - maybe the steel dragons found a portal leading centuries in the past), but in this case, it seems clear that Arwyl Swan's Son experienced every year that Torilians did.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Oy, vey! O.k, if Sigil's timeline is linked to Forgotten Realms and has gone forward 100+ years as well, that's all fine and dandy - for the Forgotten Realms. But what about Ebberon, etc? If they haven't gone forward to match, then that means a character from Ebberon who traveled to Sigil or Faerun would effectively be visiting the future, since from his chronological timeframe Toril should still be experiencing the events of 3E and Mystra's death and the Spellplague should be in the near future! Likewise, in 3E Sigil's chronological time was shortly after the Faction War, maybe Lady's Edict 3 or thereabouts. (Let me explain... let's say that the year in all three campaign settings is arbitrarily set to 0 in 3E, for the sake of argument. So they all match up nice and neat... the year 0 in Sigil = the year 0 in Toril and Ebberon. But then, Sigil and Toril are moved forward 100 years, making it the year 100 in both those campaigns. But Ebberon's year is still set at 0! See the problem?) Powers, this is giving me a headache!</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Right. It's gone forward from the time of the Faction War by about 100 years from the perspective of the "present day" in a 4th edition Forgotten Realms campaign, and probably only from that perspective. Not from the perspective of the DMG2, for example, which is almost certainly only a few years after the Faction War (or, for example, Kylie wouldn't still be described as young).</p>

<p>It's the same city, but in an FR campaign you're playing it 100 years later than the time depicted in the DMG2.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>But what about Ebberon, etc?

<p>Huh? No. Eberron (unlike the Realms) doesn't have any canonical link to Sigil's timeline, so it might be placed at any time period. Someone who travels from Eberron to Sigil might end up there before the Faction War, after the Faction War, or back during the time of the Great Upheaval, even. We really don't know Eberron's chronological relationship with other campaign settings. That's for future designers to decide, if they so choose. I would assume, based on original publishing dates, that Eberron's "present day" is probably equivalent to 594 CY in Oerth's calendar, or 1374 DR in Toril, but that's just an assumption and probably reflects a bias on my part toward Oerth and toward Dragon and Dungeon Magazines published at the time. But if that's true, a Eberronite would probably end up in Sigil circa 4 LE, and Mystra won't be dead yet until 15 LE (1385 DR).</p>

<p>You seem to be assuming that whatever year it is in Sigil for one campaign setting, it therefore has to be that year in Sigil for all campaign settings. There's no reason this has to be the case. The various campaign settings didn't advance their timelines at the same rate in 2nd edition (Dragonlance went forward several generations in that period), or 3rd edition (Toril's timeline went forward significantly faster than Oerth), so there's no reason they would have to in 4th edition, either. </p>

<p>This is nothing new. So no, I don't see a problem. Someone traveling from Oerth in 597 CY would end up in Toril in 1377 DR and in Sigil in 7 LE. Someone from Toril in 1479 DR would end up in Sigil in 109 LE, or on Oerth in 697 CY, or in Eberron on whatever date you think the relative time in Eberron might be - there's nothing official on this.</p>

<p>The relative time doesn't change when the setting advances. Well, actually, that's not necessarily true - the designers can change the relative time if they feel like it, and they have before. Spelljammer used to sync Dragonlance with the Forgotten Realms at a time shortly after the War of the Lance, but later on Planescape synced it around the time of the Summer of Chaos several generations later, so there's a disconnect there. So things <span style="font-style:italic">could</span> change, but they don't unless the designers say they have. Which they haven't, in this case. At least, not yet.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>""But what about Ebberon, etc? If they haven't gone forward to match""</p>

<p>Eberron was never meant to match up with other campaign settings, as evidenced by the fact that they have a completely different, zany cosmology.  Unlike Greyhawk and Forgotten Realms, the Eberron Setting was never designed for cross-setting travel.  Probably, this is partly because it would be too difficult to deal with the technological differences between Eberron and all the other settings.  Toril and Greyhawk (and Planescape) are medieval to renaissance societies, whereas the society of Eberron is Victorian/Neo-Imperialist.  Trying to reconcile the techological differences would be one huge headache on so many levels.  Not to mention that the fluff is completely different.  While I haven't read EVERYTHING on Eberron's materials, it (unlike the other campaign settings) seems to maintain that the various races are native to Eberron, whereas with Greyhawk and Forgotten Realms/Toril, it states that most of the sentient races are not indigenous to the planets, but rather, came via ancient interplanar diasporas (which I think is originally part of the Spelljammer fluff)  Another example: One of the books (Dragons of Eberron, I think) states that gem dragons are the result of an ancient genetic experiment combining chromatic and metallic dragon DNA, rather than being their own species as they are in other settings.  If you really wanted to explain it away however, in all likelihood Eberron would be a self-contained planet like Athas, seeing as how even Lolth doesn't have any influence there.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Eberron's "technology" is not actually "technology" but advanced applications of Arcane Magic and Elemental binding.  And it wouldn't be at all far-fetched if many of those things in Eberron were in Planescape.</p>

<p>The differences in cosmology for Eberron was because it was designed as a "uniquely 3rd edition" campaign setting.  And one of the features of 3e was that cosmologies could be up to the DM to design.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>So for purposes of MY Sigil-based 4E campaign, using the DMG II, I can ignore this Forgotten Realms business of Arwyl being 150 years old and treat the current Sigil year as 4 LE? (Logically, most of the human characters in Forgotten Realms "Future Sigil" should be dead (i.e. Black Marian, Autochon, Lothar, Caravan, etc.), unless they all got blessed by the gods like Arwyl or became liches(!) No thanks. I'll stick with the present.) But that still leaves things kind of screwed up, because characters from 4E's Toril can't meet up with regular characters unless they use a time-portal to the past or something! (In other words, if I make a 4E Forgotten Realms character, I can't have that character meet a "generic" character I've created based on the DMG II version of Sigil, because one character exists 100 years in the future of the other, unless I create a time-portal to send the Forgotten Realms character from 109 LE to 4 LE! Which I suppose I COULD, but It's a pain in the ass; I really wish WOTC would use a synchronized timeline for all its campaigns.)</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Well, the edition you're using to play the game doesn't necessarily affect what year it is in the campaign world. You could play with 4th edition characters in 1370 DR, if you wanted. Or you could use 1st edition characters in 1470 DR. Or use another game system entirely, like GURPS or FUDGE or White Wolf's Storyteller system.</p>

<p>You could also sync the timelines up however you wanted, of course. It's your game, after all. I'm just citing how it synced up officially, the last time they bothered to sync things officially. That matters only as much as you want it to.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>There's a subscriber only history article on Vecna and Kas, that's told completely from the point of view of a Vistani Narrator, this being a 4e Vistani who aren't necessarily Human, and are nomads who travel between Shadowfell and other worlds.  The interesting thing is that she mentions that Vecna escapes his Shadowfell Domain (4e parlance for a Ravenloft Domain), but not much else after that other than he's a deity.  It's almost as if they ignored most of Die Vecna Die or retconned it away, but then again it's an in character narration so the details are highly suspect.</p>

<p>Most of the article was about why Vecna became a Lich, the alliance and betrayal of Acerak, and his relationship with Kas.  The Narrator claims the Sword of Kas had a fragment of Vecna's mind, and influenced Kas, now a Vampire Paladin to betray Vecna.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">
