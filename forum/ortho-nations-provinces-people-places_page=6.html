Kwint</div>
Nah.  Me not crossposting from the LJ is pure laziness, and the knowledge that Clueless has a direct feed already.  (Which sometimes gets some distinctly odd results - if Shemmy was <span style="font-style:italic">my</span> DM, I certainly wouldn't be shooting him links to new 'loth writeups...  <img src="http://planewalker.com/sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/lol.png" title="Laughing out loud" alt="Laughing out loud" class="smiley-content"/> )</p>

<p>Crossposting stuff from my LJ to Planewalker is just fine, as long as proper credit is given.  Any failure on my part to do so promptly is just me being an eccentric bum.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Okay, havin' been given the go ahead on postin' from Eldershinx's LJ that stuff Orthoan that has yet to make it to this venue, here is Eldersphinx's Immergaunt (28 Jan 06):</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div><span style="font-weight:bold">Ortho: Immergaunts</span>
The lockstep order, structure and efficiency brought by the Harmonium to Ortho has its disadvantages. Though many threats and dangers have been eradicated entirely, making the world safer for all who live in it, a few of the most cunning and vicious threats to public safety have simply taken to the shadows, striking only at night and vanishing before capture. These monsters lurk along the fringes of civilization and in the foul niches that grow up in Ortho's greatest cities, and prey on the weak, defenseless and destitute. Hunting immergaunts is one of the necessary chores of the Harmonium guard - but they have no great success in dealing with the creatures. The commonfolk, unable to fight against such enemies directly but needing some sort of recourse, have managed at least to give a name to their tormentors. They call these beings 'Immergaunts'.</p>

<p>An immergaunt appears very much like a common shadow - a vaguely humanoid shape made of animated, soul-chilling blackness - but is much more fearsome, for its features and exact appearance reflect the hidden terror that lies within every mortal soul. Each person who sees an immergaunt witnesses it somewhat differently, putting their own fears on it as a mask, and innocent civilians and battle-hardened watchmen alike have found themselves unable to defy the creature's hunger. Fortunately, the appearance of an immergaunt does not lead to high levels of valor on the creature's part - one usually only appears when a single, vulnerable target is present, and will not seek to pursue fleeing victims into any open or well-lit location.</p>

<p>Immergaunts are thought to be the result of a chaotic curse, forming themselves from the nightmares of those who have come too close to the Abyss or descend from certain tainted bloodlines of Iathra and Thaera. Even in these bright days, the appearance of immergaunts in an isolated village can lead to witch-hunts against those suspected of dreaming these monsters into existence. The Harmonium has declared that creation of immergaunts is an unwitting crime at best, and does not sanction mob violence against those responsible - but is also noticeably slow to retaliate against villagers who lynch a visitor for bringing the immergaunt curse to their home. Travelers are advised to be on their best behavior, and to be ready to make a quick departure should matters begin to turn ugly.</p>

Challenge Rating: 4<br />
Treasure: None<br />
Alignment: Always chaotic evil<br />
Advancement: 5-8 HD (Medium)<br />
Level Adjustment: -</p>

<p>Daylight Vulnerability (Ex): An immergaunt exposed to direct sunlight, or within the area of a Daylight spell, is greatly weakened. It can make only one move action per combat round, and is unable to attack either by touch or its nightmarish tendril, or affect characters with its frightful vusage. The immergaunt also loses the ability to become incorporeal (and becomes corporeal if it wasn't already). These restrictions last until the immergaunt is no longer exposed to direct sunlight.</p>

<p>Frightful Visage (Su): Any creature of less than 6 HD that meets the gaze of an immergaunt must make a DC 13 Will save or become frightened, as if affected by a Scare spell. If the save succeeds, the creature is instead shaken for 1 round. Creatures with more than 6 HD are immune to this effect, and a creature affected by an immergaunt's frightful visage cannot be targeted again by the same immergaunt until 24 hours have passed. The save DC is Charisma-based.</p>

<p>Incorporeal Form (Su): An immergaunt can become incorporeal as a free action. Normal attacks against an immergaunt suffer a 50% miss chance while the immergaunt is incorporeal; the immergaunt's own touch attacks suffer this penalty as well. An incorporeal immergaunt can return to corporeal state as a free action, but cannot both become and cease being incorporeal in the same combat round.</p>

<p>Nightmarish Tendril (Su): An immergaunt can create a shadowy, clinging tendril to make a trip attack against one opponent within 30 feet as a standard action. An opponent knocked prone by this attack must take a full-round action to stand up, due to the tendril's vile nature.</div></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>And, from Eldersphinx's LJ (29 Jan 06), The Neverseen:</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div><span style="font-weight:bold">Ortho: The Neverseen</span>
There's a legend being whispered in the alleys of Three Rivers. It's said a thief has recently come to the city - a thief like none ever seen before, the best thief in the world. Possibly the best thief to have ever lived. Valuables and secrets are being liberated from the homes and safe-vaults of the city's most eminent personages, despite the best security money can buy. The wealthy and noble of Three Rivers are frightened and furious, the city watch and Harmonium investigators are frustrated and frightened, and whoever's behind the rash of crimes laughs at them all. </p>

<p>And the downtrodden, and desperate, and unlucky, take hope in the fact that the system which grinds them under is not, it seems, invincible. Their hero is a stranger to them, known only by his deeds and the anguish he visits on their betters, but they love him none the less. They call him the Neverseen.</p>

<p>Such is rumor, legend and hearsay, in any case. The truth is somewhat grimmer. The Neverseen does exist, and is a rogue of no small repute, and does presently ply the cross-trade in the city of Three Rivers on Ortho. But he doesn't do so for personal gain, or to inspire the masses - far from it. In truth, the man who has been dubbed the Neverseen is actually a deep agent of the temple of the Lord of Watchfulness, one of the mightiest powers for law on Ortho, and his actions are meant not to serve as a stalwart example but instead to tempt the weak into a state of sin.</p>

<p>The motivation for such a plot is simple. Man is fallible, and easily tempted by chaos - so better to expose those susceptible to such error at the temple's own urging, with inquisitors close at hand to help reform such endangered souls. By inspiring others to engage in theft, sedition and other unatural acts, the Neverseen serves to evoke the hidden sin that would otherwise emerge only gradually - very much like drawing poison forth all at once from a wound, allowing it to later heal. Such tactics are very effective - the Neverseen himself was once such a young an foolish soul, tempted by the ways of chaos before being exposed to the teachings of the Lord of Watchfulness.</p>

<p>The Neverseen's work in Three Rivers is only in its early stages, at present - the word has just begun to spread, and those foolish enough to see the Neverseen's deeds as something to emulate have not yet started to practice the craft. In the coming months, the Neverseen will continue to engage in visible, daring raids against the city notables, spread innuendo through the poor quarters encouraging the less fortunate in their own criminal intentions, and quietly mark the most promising footpads of the city for special attention from temple priests. If raids against city notables turn up evidence of corruption, personal failings or other matters of interest to the Lord of Watchfulness, so much the better; any such findings will discreetly be placed in the care of the local temple hierarchy.</p>

<p>City watch, Harmonium agents, and outside adventurers will undoubtedly all strive to capture the Neverseen, but will face an uphill battle. The Neverseen himself is quite clever and competent, and the priests of the Lord of Watchfulness will employ much indirect but still formidable leverage in order to ensure that he continues his work.</p>

Feats: Combat Expertise, Improved Disarm, Improved Feint, Improved Initiative, Iron Will, Negotiator, Nimble Fingers, Quick Draw, Stealthy, Weapon Finesse<br />
Equipment and Possessions: Tomas Nevirsen usually works the streets equipped with nothing more noteworthy than a set of simple clothes, a brace of nonmagical daggers, and a well-concealed set of masterwork thieves' picks; he oftentimes will even go about a foray only so simply equipped. He believes in trusting to his own skills and talents rather than magical trinkets, and knows that many of the highest-class security measures are specifically designed to detect and counter magical intrusion, not normal skill and finesse. If need be, though, the Neverseen can equip himself quite richly - he has cached in a safe location a mithril chain shirt, several magical daggers and other weaponry, a ring of protection +4, gloves of dexterity +6, a necklace of adaptation, three immovable rods, and a sizeable selection of scrolls, potions and minor wands. Additional equipment can be requested from the servants of the Lord of Watchfulness, if circumstances permit.</div><br />
I notice there's no alignment given, is this on purpose, leaving it up to the DM?...<br />

         <p>I need to check the canon but I'm inclined to say yes it has been eliminated. Considering one of the first principles of the Hardheads seems to be "All are equal". That makes it *very* difficult to validate the 'lesser' status that slavery implies. </p>

<p>It's likely one of the laws on the books dating from the founders time period, likely pushed into place by Prince Romhel himself. I'll have to check the canon to see if it supports that view...</p>

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Because I hope to make Measure One by my birthday and also because I, on occasion, like to enable laziness (see <a href="forum_.html" class="bb-url">this post</a>), I present the latest entry from Eldersphinx's LJ, "The Monsters of Ortho, Part I" (01 Feb 06):</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div><span style="font-weight:bold">Monsters of Ortho, Part I</span>
The following monsters all use game statistics from the SRD, with only minor modifications. Though they are apparently unique to Ortho, their close cousins can be found on many other worlds.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Blooddriver</span> - These strange self-animate devices have served as steeds for generals and champions of Motmurk for longer than anyone can remember. No one is certain, anymore, whether the first blooddrivers were the creation of orcish shamans, gifts from Ilneval or another power, or coming from another origin entirely. Each takes the semblance of a huge, patient scorpion with an unnaturally smooth and hard carapace of a strange, variegated shade of green. Though such creatures are prized war steeds, they aren't entirely trusted - more than one hero has apparently become slowly infected with paranoia and megalomania after prolonged periods riding a blooddriver, and taken their steed into the wilderness with the insane intent of overthrowing all of Motmurk single-handed.</p>

<p>Use the stats for a retriever, with the following changes:<br />
- Replace the bite attack with a stinger attack - +10 melee (1d8+5 plus poison).<br />
- A bloodddriver can use more than one eye ray attack per round, with the assistance of a rider. If the rider uses a standard action to activate an eye ray, the blooddriver can make two eye ray attacks in that round. A particular ray can be used only once every 2 rounds.<br />
- Replace the Find Target special quality with the ability to continually Pass Without Trace, as the spell.<br />
- A blooddriver's poison stinger is Injury, Fortitude DC 15, initial 1d8 Str, secondary 2d6 Str. The Fortitude save DC is Constitution-based.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Emberhawks</span> - Native to the Flamedance Mountains of the province of Keln'in, these savage creatures are at the top of the food chain, roaming the skies and devouring (almost) any creature that they sight upon. Though not quite foolish enough to attack beholders or their grell servants, they do consider humanoid visitors to be fair prey and will stoop upon such targets with incredible fury. Cutting loose a horse or other large animal may serve to placate an emberhawk's hunger - but individuals trying such a trick had best be sure to be long gone by the time the emberhawk finishes its meal.</p>

<p>Use the stats for an arrowhawk, with the following changes:<br />
- Type changes to Outsider (Fire, Native).<br />
- Electricity ray changes to a fire ray, with the same attack bonus and damage.<br />
- Has immunity to fire, electricity and poison, resistance to acid 10 and sonic 10.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Ghulang Dhal</span> - Also known as mountain spirits, these beings have dwelt in the remote reaches of the Xaric highlands since time immemorial. They seem like small, deceptively slender humanoids with dull grey, stonelike skin and eternally wild hair, and near-transparent gossamer wings that speed into a rainbow blur whenever the creature takes to the air. Though the dwarves who are their closest neighbors often speak of them with hair-pulling aggravation, they are considered good luck by many and tolerated as fellow creations of the land. Nontheless, their numbers are growing fewer as mankind spreads further over Ortho, and their final days may be coming soon. Their pranks and daily lives grow less joyful and more desperate with each passing year.</p>

<p>Use the stats for a dust mephit, with the following changes:<br />
- Has no breath weapon.<br />
- Replace spell-like abilities with 3/day Meld Into Stone, Stone Shape, 1/day Transmute Rock to Mud, all as a 6th-level druid (save DC 12+spell level).<br />
- Heals only when in contact with raw, unworked stone.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Gnaazg</span> - Bestial, twisted creatures dwelling in the inhospiable Anvil of Fangs in northwestern Keln'in, these monsters are thought by some to actually have some glimmering of intelligence. The beholders who rule the region, though, insist that gnaazg are merely a more cunning and unpleasant kind of dumb beast. Since the Harmonium as a whole is uncertain of the proper method in which intelligent gnaazg should be treated - attempt the difficult task of enlightening them in the ways of Law, or exterminate them utterly as chaotic creatures? - the beholders' claim is allowed to stand in the main. For their own part, the beholders treat the gnaazg as a distasteful but self-renewing food source.</p>

<p>Use the stats for a troll, with the following changes:<br />
- Speed increases to 40 ft.<br />
- Intelligence is reduced to 3.<br />
- Replace the Track feat with the Run feat.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Horned Man</span> - These huge, stag-antlered creatures are only rarely found, even in the inland hills of Omospondia that are their ancestral range. Though the orthodox claim that these beings are fae-kin and so should be driven to extinction, the people of Omospondia claim the Horned Men as a vital part of their history, and resist any efforts at wholesale genocide. This does not stop the nobles of Omospondia from organizing a yearly hunt of a single Horned Man, however - such a ritual is considered a sign of valor and good breeding in that land.</p>

<p>Use the stats for a hill giant, with the following changes:<br />
- A Horned Man gains a Horn attack, at +15 melee (1d8+7/x3). This attack deals triple damage on a charge and cannot be used in conjunction with any other attack method in a full attack.<br />
- A Horned Man can neither throw nor catch rocks.</div></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>From Eldersphinx's LJ (02 Feb 06) sans smartass quip (oops...):</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div><span style="font-weight:bold">Monsters of Ortho, Part II</span>
Following up on yesterday's entry, a few more monsters for Ortho that use mostly ORD stats but have a fairly radically different appearance.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Miststeed</span> - Ghostly horses that roam the forests and coasts of southern Ulfrheim, it's impossible to say whether these apparitions are natural beings, guises taken on by some other being, the spirits of a species exterminated by the Harmonium, or something else entirely. Hunters have tried to capture or drive off miststeeds in the past; the miststeeds mock such efforts with their continued existence, and roam wherever they choose.</p>

<p>Use the stats for a unicorn, with the following changes:<br />
- Gains the incorporeal subtype.<br />
- Speed is fly 60 ft (perfect).<br />
- Has no horn attack; hooves attack at +11 melee touch (2d6 sacred).<br />
- Has no Strength score.<br />
- Radiates a continual Magic Circle against Law effect and can Detect Law as a free action, rather than the comparable powers against evil.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Oqakki</span> - Said by many natives of Hazhkan to be sly, malicious trickster-demons, these creatures have the faces and heads of men attached to the bodies of monstrous spiders. Though sardonic, deceptive and not wholly friendly to the Harmonium, these beings have sometimes provided valuable advice and assistance to human explorers and so have not been declared a race enemy. Debate on whether and how to bring the Oqakki into the Harmonium is proceeding slowly, but an expedition to uncover more information or test the efficacy of conversion methods may be imminent.</p>

<p>Use the stats for an aranea, with the following changes:<br />
- Replace the bite attack with a sting attack, +5 melee (1d4 plus poison).<br />
- Oqakki cannot change shape, but can use magic aura and ventriloquism at will.<br />
- Oqakki poison is Injury, Fortitude DC 13, initial damage 1d6 Dex, secondary damage 2d6 Dex, with a Constitution-based save DC.<br />
- Oqakki cast spells as 3rd-level druids.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Riverfeeder</span> - Large, serpentine beasts that lurk along the bottom of the deep, silt-rich rivers of the Iironda coast, riverfeeders are usually placid creatures that remain in their natural waters, feed on any small fish unfortunate enough to cross their path and don't trouble surface folk. During times of drought or famine, though, or one of their (blessedly infrequent) mating cycles, these creatures will swim close to the surface in search of fresh meat. Common folk usually grab whatever's handy in order to placate these beings; the Harmonium tries to hunt them down. When they aren't maddened with hunger, a riverfeeder's presence does help to keep the surrounding waters reasonably clean and drinkable, though, which is why such ferocious beasts are tolerated.</p>

<p>Use the stats for a digester, with the following changes:<br />
- Add the aquatic subtype.<br />
- Speed changes to 10 ft, swim 60 ft.<br />
- Replace the claw attack with a bite attack (similar attack and damage).<br />
- Replace the Jump skill rating with the Swim skill.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sibilant</span> - These strange, catlike creatures lurk in the scrub forest and swamplands of lowland Heka. Sly, malicious and deceptive, these creatures are hated by many - but were deemed sacred messengers of the Lord of Repose by the local patriarch, three centuries ago, and so cannot be hunted openly. This doesn't keep local farmers from trying to club one over the head whenever they feel their actions won't be discovered, however.</p>

<p>Use the stats for a krenshar, with the following changes:<br />
- Replace the scare special attack with the spell-like abilities to use Glibness 1/day and Augury 1/day, both as a 2nd-level caster.<br />
- Intelligence increases to 10.<br />
- Gains skill ratings of Bluff +6 and Sense Motive +6.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Tzotke</span> - A race of slave laborers bred by the autocrats of Pan Thaera, these beings served loyally and without complaint for many years, unaware of the potential for any better life. Their inner nature and upbringing included a deep, abiding desire for structure and order that could be somewhat satisfied within their own ranks but was sadly lacking across the wider Empire, and so when the Harmonium arose the tzotke willingly traded their allegiance. They provided information, supplies and other aid to the invading Harmonium armies, and in exchange were granted their freedom and an enclave on the northwestern edge of the Thaeran continent.</p>

<p>Tzotke are tall, well-muscled hairless humanoids; their hands each have an extra opposing thumb, and thick plates of bone line the front and back of their upper torso. Though physically imposing, they are not very outgoing or ambitious; few leave their homeland. The reaction of human Thaerans to the sight of the tzotke reinforce this behavior - even today, some Thaerans still consider tzotke to be 'dirty traitors', and will vilify them or worse if given the chance.</p>

<p>Use the stats for bugbears, with the following changes:<br />
- Add the special quality of Goad: When reduced to half maximum HP or less, a tzotke gains a +2 bonus to Strength but suffers a -4 penalty to Wisdom.<br />
- Alignment is usually Lawful Neutral.<br />
- Add Craft, Handle Animal, Knowledge (local), Profession and Survival to the list of racial skills. <br />
- Favored class is Monk.</div></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>In any case, I was originally thinking about making the post to Ortho in a single lump, once both parts were online.  (Doing 2000 words of writing in one day, then breaking it in half for daily posting, lets me have a short but welcome period of laziness.)  Since it's there now, tho, I'll refrain.

         <p>I was looking over my map of Ortho, and (surprise, surprise) a few questions arose in my mind...I know the cities of Delastra and Steelgate originated from Rip's site and there they are described as having been flooded due to rising ocean levels...Now I am under the impression this is not so with our Ortho...So, my question is, what is the importance of these cities?...Are they the provincial capitals of their respective provinces?...I know the Isles have not been written up yet, but what do you think?...Clueless, Iathra is your baby, is Delastra that province's capital or just an important trade port?...If it is not the capital, what is?...</p>

<p>As an aside, I figure y'all feel I should be finishing up my provincial write-ups instead of askin' questions, but with my brother in the hospital and lots of work at my job to distract me, questions come easier...I've been jotting down thoughts and notes in lieu of writing text, which it seems I'm at a loss for at the moment...Semi-heated forum interactions is also a distraction I've participated in lately, but a fun one, so sue me...Okay, I'm starting to dig a hole, so I best finish up here...</p>

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><span style="font-weight:bold"><span style="text-decoration:underline">Icons of the Octave Council</span></span><br />
Just as Romhel of Voll, Jhary of Heka, Anju of Pan Thaera and Morgranhu of Iathra were the first heroes of the Harmonium and the Great War of Unification, so too were there others throughout the first century who epitomized the ideals of the new Ortho. Later, as the war moved around the world, these others would step to the fore to lead the forces of Harmony and embody the goals of the movement. The first four would be mirrored later in the war by these Latter Four and the combination of the two would be icons for Ortho’s Octave Council.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">The Latter Four were:</span></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Varzak the Crushing Fist</span>, a Hierarch of Motmurk, led the forces of Xaric and Motmurk against the nations of Parsadia (modern Omospondia and Karazam) who stood against the forces of unification. He is most famous for the decade long siege against the elven state of Zotikopolis, leading ultimately to the destruction of the last stronghold of the elves of Ortho and salting the earth thereof.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Xiang Zhou</span> was the Chamberlain of the Court of Han who fostered the alliance between the Knights of Harmony in the west and Iironda in the east, drawing up the treaty that would lead the two against the vile elves of the Shaar. Once that war had reached in victorious conclusion, he headed the Committee For a Lawful World which chartered the Harmonious Concordant Constitution that established the world government’s structure and the High Laws of Ortho.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Queen Ealataeva of Alaens</span>, High Priestess of Alae, who stopped the unnecessary loss of thousands, possibly millions, of lives when she gave her life at the Battle That Was Not. The forces of Xaric had marched through western Omospondia from Rhogma in the northwest, south to Aortia and moved east towards Alaens. As the ravenous army sought revenge for centuries old slights at the hands of their one-time masters, Alaens’ generals called for the remaining members of the Omospondia confederation to send their forces to help protect the Marble City. When the hosts met, the Omospondians were outnumbered seven to one, the Xaric legions having been bolstered by allies from those Parsadian City-States that had joined their cause. After parley occurred, the Queen remained between the two armies and began to commune with her divine patron. The forces of the Xaric army charged forward, mindful that the Queen was a High Priestess and, as they assaulted her, she fell before their onslaught, a beatific smile on her face. Spreading from her bloody body was a golden light that engulfed both sides of the conflict infusing all with a great sense of sadness and loss. The two armies came to a standstill, neither side having confronted the other with arms, save those who had slain the queen. Then, a sense of hope arose and the two sides met in Harmony. The people of Omospondia joined the Crusade for Concordance and many were saved by the martyrdom of Queen Ealataeva.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Gnar’ar’rikx</span> was the great unifier of the beholders of Keln’in who fought the xenophobia of its people and coordinated the forces of beholder-kin with the Forces of the West against the Elven Shaar. It was his will that kept him in power long enough to change perception of its people of the outsiders and brought Keln’in into the world community.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">The First Four, The Latter Four and the Octave Council:</span><br />
The combination of the First Four and the Latter Four are icons of the Octave Council and the basis for the form of that body. Romhel and Varzak are the icons for the two Harmonium members, the Composer of Planar Harmony [formerly the Composer of the Army] and the Composer of Prime Harmony [formerly the Composer of the Spelljamming Navy, formerly the Composer of the Navy]. Anju and Ealataeva are the icons for the two religious members, the Composers of Metaphysical and Theological Harmony, respectively. Gnar’ar’rikz and Morgranhu are icons for the two state-oriented members, the Composer of Civic Harmony and the Composer of Agrarian Harmony. Xiang Zhou is the icon for the Composer of Ethical Harmony and Jhary is the icon for the Composer of Magical Harmony.</p>

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>So, here's 95% of my entry for the Province of Omospondia...Any thoughts and/or suggestions on how to better it are more than welcome...<br />
Kwint</p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-weight:bold">OMOSPONDIA - Land of Heroes</span></span><br />
This land, located on the western half of the Parsadian peninsula, has been ever known for its mythic warriors, agricultural production, traditionally strong navies and classical culture. Omospondia is an ancient name, originally describing those city-states along the western and southern coasts of Parsadia that unified under a confederation of equals to defeat the mercantile power of Dardonian League and its monopoly on eastern and southern trade. It disappeared and reappeared throughout history ultimately to be resurrected by the Harmonium to describe the entirety of western Parsadia. Located in the northwest corner of the continent of Keln, it was from here that the humans of much of Mot originated, a legacy that would come back to haunt the land during the Great War of Unification.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Ancient Omospondia and Parsadia</span><br />
Many are the tales of the heroes of ancient times who helped shape the culture of this land- Iotar of Hiota, who slew the hundred hands tall Giagantos who had despoiled the Agiosopolis of Krotos and carried away Chrysemene, First Daughter of Epidonus; Myrgidar of Koma, who outwitted Pyroklaxion the Crimson Scourge, convincing her to devour her children that were harrying the Mines of Zomos; Pertalos of Nisiprasinos, who convinced the Sea Devils of the Lykos (Wolf) Straits to seek their true homeland in the Southern Oceans, securing the sea lanes for his people; Protokles, Archon of Phemis, who introduced the concepts of democracy and republican government; Phleogone of Xios who stopped a war and brought tears to the eyes of the gods with her sculpture, <span style="font-style:italic">The Lost</span>. These are but a few of the heroes of Omospondia’s mythic past, but foremost of the heroes of ancient times was Iskandros.</p>

<p>Iskandros was the grandson of King Aotar, who had invaded the Land of Heroes from his holdings of Kokinos (‘Rhendholm’ in Ulfar) in Ulfrheim and conquered the city-states of western Parsadia, including Krotos, Alaens and Bisos of Omospondia, and establishing the intercontinental Kingdom of Aotarium. Aotar’s son, King Hakos, established a capital at Aotaria and solidified the new kingdom , but expanded it no further. Hakos’s son, Iskandros, was not content to merely rule this new kingdom, for in his youth he had sought out the Seer of Iphika and knew his destiny was to expand the kingdom or die. And expand it he did. He took the combined martial and magical styles of his Ulfrheim heritage and Parsadian birth land, creating a new style army and conquering the remaining city-states of Old Omospondia, those of southeastern Parsadia, most of modern Karazam and the northern coast of modern Hazhkan, creating the largest Kelnic empire of ancient times. So great were his accomplishments and so adored was he by the people of the new Empire of Iskandria that he was elevated to divinity upon his ritual suicide at the temple complex in ancient Gurakat (modern Iskandral).</p>

<p>But not all was gyros, olives and wine. Those who spoke out for old freedoms and traditional independence were exiled to colonies west across the Iron Sea by the tens, possibly hundreds, of thousands throughout Iskandros’s reign. Others followed the exiles to the west voluntarily, silent in their opposition to the empire, yet seeking the same freedoms. </p>

<p>Although Rhendholm and the western colonies would rebel a generation after Iskandros’s death, the rest of the empire would last for centuries under the conqueror’s dynasty, expanding and retracting ever so. Ultimately, as happens to all dynasties, an emperor had no children and no siblings.  Thus was the fate of Klontos the Sad, the last Iskandrian emperor. Upon his death, the empire broke down into its component parts, ruled by Klontos’s distant cousins, power happy generals or strong-willed city magistrates. Western Parsadia reached back to the days of yore and reestablished Omospondia to control trade between the inner seas and the Western Ocean. Omospondia also reestablished control over their colonies across the Iron Sea. The cities of central Parsadia fell back into ancient ways, warring amongst themselves for the various resources of the Central Peaks. Iskandral and the rest of the far eastern provinces of the empire accepted the new Kisto-Iskandrian dynasty that would ultimately establish the Karazam Empire. The Iskandrian lands along the northern Hazhkani coast elevated General Padipoodra to the Raj, only to have that kingdom splinter time and time again as various heirs outlived their royal parents.</p>

<p>This state of affairs lasted for a century or so until  waves of Ogrish nomads from the east raided through eastern and central Parsadia weakening the city-states there and ultimately forcing them to join the new Karazam Empire that hounded after (some say paid) them through central Parsadia. Eventually, the Ogres were forced northward into [insert name of Province #6], but the damage had been done. The agricultural and mineral resources, as well as the ports, of the central peninsula was now the property of the eastern empire, while the Omospondian city-states and other independent kingdoms of the west were eventually relegated to a vassal-like status. This situation continued as such until the Great War broke out first in Iathra, then Pan Thaera and the Elven Shaar and ultimately coming to a conclusion on the Parsadian peninsula.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Omospondia During the Great War of Unification</span><br />
The nations of the Parsadian peninsula were generally unfazed by the Great War when it broke out in Iathra, although a great deal of trade in grains and iron increased with the Pan Thaeran Confederation. When the Knights of Harmony turned against Pan Thaera, Omospondia continued trade with the island nation and many mercenaries from the city-states set sail for the islands. Few of them returned. Concern, and in some instances panic, emerged as news that the Knights had allied with the Tyrants of Motmurk and were giving their support to the colonists in Xaric. Trade with the nations of Mot ceased and its ports were blockaded by the Omospondian navy. While the war progressed from Pan Thaera to the Elven Shaar, the nations of the Lykos Straits and the Sidero (Iron) Sea began to boil.</p>

<span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-weight:bold">Geography</span></span><br />
Omospondia is a province extremes, from jungles in the southwest to forests in the central midlands to the Desert of Sweet Sighs in the northeast. Gentle sandy beaches are found along the shores of the Asimi (Silver) Sea and Drako (Dragon) Sea in the south, rocky beaches along the Sidero Sea in the west and cliff riddled shores along the Lykos Straits. With its great rivers and inland lakes, much of the land has been cleared over the last millennium and Omospondia’s plains are some of the best farmland in the world, producing huge amounts of grain, fruits and vegetables as well as textile fiber plants such as cotton and flax. The central highlands are rocky and jagged and are thus the least populated portion of the province. The region is generally used for the herding of goats and sheep and the mining of copper, tin and to a lesser degree, iron, gold and silver, as well as minor gemstones. With the exception of the Desert of Sweet Sighs and the central highlands, the land is plush with vegetation and life.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">The Desert of Sweet Sighs</span></span><br />
In the northeast corner of Omospondia lies the barren sands and rocks of the ever-expanding lands of the Desert of Sweet Sighs. This region, which reaches as far east into Karazam as it does west into Omospondia, is completely without any natural life, either flora or fauna, and those who enter it soon are dead as well for the sun, and the land itself it seems, leaches water from the body. A breeze, which in the summer may build to a great and constant wind, blows at all times throughout this devastated land, reminding those foolish enough of the sighs of both lovers and those at death’s door.</p>

<p>But this is not the land as it always was. A little over four centuries ago, this land was another of the poli, Zotikopolis, the City of the Fey Folk. The elves of this land were fair, with a set of grey elven philosophers as leaders, a high elven middle class of merchants and military leaders and humans of the area as laborers, farmers and militia, all happily co-existing, tending the great fields of barley and wheat and the orchards of peaches, apples and pears. But then came the orcish armies of Motmurk during the Great War.</p>

<p>Those who could not reach the magically reinforced walls and were not slain in the original onslaught were driven to the winds. Those within the walls were to withstand a siege that would last a decade. Half way through the seige, elven refugees from the south appeared within the walls, the lone survivors of the Shaar Slaughter. Zotikopolis was the last stand for the elves of Ortho. But those that came from the south, were not of the same nature as the goodly, if independent, elves of the north. They were a bitter and cruel folk who sought vengeance. They began a ritual that would take five years, a ritual that would sap the life of both those who laid siege to the city and those who dwelled within, for the dark elves of the south saw that the only victory that could be achieved would take centuries, maybe millennia, as well as their lives.</p>

<p>So it was that after five years and a pact with Mab, the bitter Queen of Air and Darkness, those within the city and on the land around its walls were dehydrated so quickly that the wind that blew from the south blew away all trace of the attackers and all organic items they used or carried, leaving behind only their arms, armor and metal equipment. A constant breeze picked up, one that has yet to die, and whistled through the city. It is this breeze that gives the region its name. The remainder of the orcish forces that were unaffected tore down the now easily razed walls of the city, set fire to the city and the fields around it, salted the earth  and declared victory over the last of the faeries of Ortho.</p>

<p>But in the ensuing decades and centuries, the area did not grow back and the area of devestation grew. It took the world government a century to realize that something was wrong and another century to realize what was wrong was growing. Divinations and auguries gave no information on what had occurred or what was happening and the Harmonium was distracted by other issues during this time. Thus it was not until a century ago that they realized that the spread of the desert could apparently not be averted. The cities of Petris to the southwest and Taruf in Karzam have been overcome and deserted.</p>

<p>Recently, it has been observed that the effect extends out into the sea, as the salinity of the Bay of Zotika has risen to levels that can no longer sustain most sea life. At its edges, fish that enter the area quickly die and seaweed shrivels and floats to the surface; both wash ashore creating a great deal of stink. If not checked in some fashion, the Desert of Sweet Sighs may, one day, cover the entirety of Ortho.</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-weight:bold">Provincial Government</span></span><br />
The center of life in Omospondia is the poli, or city-state, and as such, the provincial government is highly decentralized. The Chamber of Ambassadors in Alaens is the de facto parliament of Omospondia, responsible for disseminating the federal laws from Harmony’s Glory to each of the poli. It is also responsible for affirming or rejecting the Omospondian representatives of the Harmonium and the Church and to directly elect the State representative to the Council of Ortho. Otherwise, its only other function is to adjudicate any disputes between the varied poli.</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-weight:bold">People and Cities</span></span><br />
The people of Omospondia are wide and varied, ranging from the tawny skinned in the east to the fairer skinned in the west, but, on the whole, they all  have a few things in common. Each is fiercely proud of his home poli, whether it be metropolitan Alaens or smaller, more rural Tritheon. The people are hardworking and proud of its heroic heritage, and as a result, many sign up with the Harmonium to serve in the expansion of Ortho throughout the multiverse. Given its location near the equator, in summer the people work hard in the morning and afternoon, taking a mid-day rest, while in the winter, they rise later and retire earlier, working the day straight through. In evenings, they celebrate life with a gusto rarely rivaled on Ortho, and on Godsday, all answer the calls of the bells of the Church of Law, whether it be in the poli temple or local village shrine. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">The Greater Poli</span><br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Alaens</span>: The City of Marble is the provincial capital and as its name implies most of its great civic buildings are constructed from marble quarried on the island of Marbos in the middle of the Bay of Agos on the Asimi Sea. These include the Hall of Ambasadors, the Queen's Palace and the attached Temple of Alae, as well as the Great University of Iathiphos.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Aotaria</span>: The ancient capital of the kingdom of Aotar, grandfather of Iskandros, was razed during the Great War four centuries past. It has been rebuilt and serves as both the Harmonium navy’s main port in the eastern Sidero Sea and the gateway to western Omospondia from the Xaric.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Bisos</span>: The City of Bulls is the first city on the inner seas for those coming from the south and is the shipping port for the varied exports from the jungles of southwest Omospondia. These include teak and mahogany, rice and millet from the interior as well as saffron, cinnamon and nutmeg among other spices.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Darda</span>: The Gateway City is the entry point to the Drako Sea, built twenty-five miles from the ruins of fabled Dardonus. It is also the hub of the fishing industry of the central portion of the inner seas.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Hiota</span>: The City of Warriors has a long tradition of warfare and sided with the Harmonium against any who would stand against them during the Great War. As such, it holds the greatest Temple of Didairdin in all of Omospondia. The god’s blessings can be seen in the bountiful harvests that are exported from this city each year.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Iphika</span>: The City of Poets hosts a challenge each year to see who can best express the virtues of harmony. Its Great Library is home to some of the most ancient scrolls depicting the valorous deeds of Omospondian heroes of yore.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Krotos</span>: The City of the Old Ones is best known for the ruins of the Agiosopolis, a temple of the once united pantheon that split into the Lords of Law and the Lords of Chaos. The city is also a center of iron mining, a metal once thought to be the blood of the ancient gods.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Koma</span>: The City of Naerids was once known for the enchanting fey that lived off the shores of Lake Hogos, but now is primarily known for the wheat production of the plains to the north and freshwater fishing of the lake.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Ledes</span>: The City of Red Sails is the main port for the wheat grown around it and in central Omospondia. This wheat is primarily shipped to the teeming millions in Iironda and Hazhkan. The Ledean Regatta, held annually, is one of the most prestigious sailing events of Keln.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Nisiprasinos</span>: The City of Seawolves was once known as a pirate haven for the feared seawolves of the Lykos Straits. It is now known for its great pine forests, which are tended well by Harmonium druids, and its shipyards which reap the rewards of those forests.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Petris</span>: Once the City of Golden Fields, Petris is now a ruin, taken in by the Desert of Sweet Sighs a century ago. All that is to be found there now is thirst, sand and madness.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Phemis</span>: The City of Democracy is the cradle of republicanism in the north, a philosophy that rules a third of the poli in Omospondia. It is also the center of cotton production for the province.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Rhogma</span>: The City of Dance is best known for its dance studios. People from all over Ortho come to learn both ancient and modern forms of dance. Its Kaisos Troop performs the world round and for the various courts of Ortho. On a more mundane level, it is also the producer of the finest shoes and footwear in all Omospondia.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Xios</span>: The Frozen City is not named such because of its climate, but for its tradition of fine sculptors. Statues of great heroes can be found on almost every street corner. Once the capital of one of the major provinces of both the Iskandrine and Karazam Empires, it controls much of the land to the north and west of the city. This includes a great deal of exceptionally arable farmland, as well as the white marble quarries of Sipsos.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Zomos</span>: The City of Bronze is the mining center of the province. Its mines producing copious amounts of copper and tin, as well as a bit of silver and gold, although the latter two are found to the west in greater quantities if not in greater concentration.</p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-weight:bold">Leaders</span></span><br />
The greatest of leaders of Omospondia are not on the provincial level, but on the level of the city-state. Of these the foremost are:</p>

<p>Iapitea of Alae is the Queen-Priestess of Alaens and is the moral leader of the province as well as its heart and soul. It is she who, through her will and empathy, makes sure that the commoners of the province are not taken advantage of and that none go hungry.</p>

<p>Archon Euthipites of Phemis encourages any and all in the province who are not happy with their lot to join the Harmonium and improve themselves. He attempts to spread the beliefs of his poli to others whose royal houses are waning. He is currently in his fourth five year term, which show how popular he is as one cannot serve as Archon for more than one term in a row.</p>

<p>King Constantiosis of Hiota makes sure that every citizen of his poli is well trained in arms and combat, despite the lack of a local enemy. All citizens capable of doing so are required to join the Harmonium in some form or another, although most serve in its military wing. His son Nostonios currently serves in the Spelljamming fleet and has attained a rank of Measure Five and captains the ship <span style="font-style:italic">Concordant Belief</span>.</p>

<p>The Dictator of Zomos is Opitomes, whose taskmasters constantly remind the workers of the city that they will be judged by Tyerusus at life’s end, so that the harder they work the better that they will be judged. The city pays all funeral costs for its citizens and has some of the finest and most beautiful cemeteries in the province. Opitomes makes sure all workers are fairly, if not extravagantly, paid for their labors and that those who break the law are paid for their transgressions.</p>

<p>The King of Iphika, the half-elf Kristoles, has begun a decade long program to move the city to the west, preparing for the apparently unstoppable growth of the Desert of Sweet Sighs to the east. The building of the town of Iphikara is being paid for out of the coffers of the poli, with the blessing of its citizens, many of which are the descendants of those who fled ruined Petris.</p>

          The Floating Towers of Thaera        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><span style="font-style:italic">Head for the hills!  I'm crossposting from my LJ of my own volition!</span></p>

<p>----</p>

<p>During the height of the the chaotic, carefree Empire of Pan Thaera, it became the custom of some powerful wizards to seek privacy and demonstrate their powers through the construction of a floating mage's tower. These edifices existed off the coast of the Thaeran landmass, able to shift location at a whim and a blatant demonstration of the owner's wealth and arcane might. Though the original owners have mostly all been dead for centuries now, the Floating Towers remain, with a variety of new occupants and many possibilities for adventure.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Appearance and Design</span><br />
As structures largely built by magic, the Floating Towers have a very non-uniform appearance. Most are between forty and sixty feet high, and from twenty to forty feet across. Cylindrical towers are most common, but square-cornered towers are not unusual either, and even more unusual architectures can be found. Each tower has been built on a small, manmade island, which covers about half again the land area of the tower itself and extends only about twenty feet into the water. This landmass counterbalances the tower's own weight and provides a bit of beachfront for small boats and the like to tie up to.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">A Typical Tower - Aur'Kenathai</span><br />
This tower is fairly typical of the Floating Towers - not too big, not too small, not too outrageously constructed. The wizard who owns the tower today is a native Thaeran who claims to be a descendant of the archmage who constructed the tower originally; his personal enemies like to grumble that his supposed lineage is just a lie to further his claim to Aur'Kenathai. The Harmonium keeps a wary eye on him regardless.</p>

<p>In addition to the tower's master, a small garrison of well-trained Harmonium troops resides in Aur'Kenathai - ostensibly to defend it against enemies and provide a quick-reaction force to the nearby coastal territories, but in reality as much to keep an eye on the wizard they serve and insure that his experiments don't blow up in anyone's face. Against a wizard prepared to betray the Octave Council, of course, they will likely be lucky to simply get the warning out before dying, of course, but they may prove useful in the event of simple carelessness. And in any event, the wizard seems like a cheerful and well-meaning sort, hardly the kind of person who'd stoop to common treachery. Right?</p>

<p>The following design notes draw upon information found in the <span style="text-decoration:underline">Stronghold Builder's Guidebook</span>:</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">* Ground Level</span>: The island below Aur'Kenathai is solid rock, formed ages ago from the layering of many Wall of Stone spells. Sparse grass cover has managed to take root here over the past several centuries, but it's by no means inviting. A basic dock has recently been cut out of the small cliff on the island's south side, in order to accomodate supply and troop ships from the mainland.<br />
<span style="font-style:italic">- Components</span>: 1 basic dock, 4 foundation; 500 gp, 1 + 4 spaces. The ground level and foundation of a Floating Tower must have at least half as many spaces as the interior tower itself; these spaces need not be walled, but do count in the total for determining locomotion and mobility costs (see SBG, page 47).</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">* Walls and Structure</span>: Aur'Kenathai's exterior walls are hewn stone (originally constructed from Wall of Stone spells) and its interior walls are living wood. The latter disturbs the Harmonium more than a bit, but they haven't yet chosen to demand that it be replaced with normal wood.<br />
<span style="font-style:italic">- Components</span>: 70% exterior hewn stone (7 spaces), 30% interior living wood (3 spaces). 6,000 gp.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">* First Floor</span>: The lowest floor of Aur'Kenathai is mostly storage space - rows of shelves loaded with foodstuffs, spare uniforms and armor, and similar supplies. While they don't seriously expect to ever have to defend the tower against a mundane opponent, the Harmonium garrison of Aur'Kenathai have trained to set ambushes in here, striking from behind a shelf against unwary enemies and skirmishing through the narrow, mazelike confines. A spiralling stair in the back leads to the tower's upper levels.<br />
<span style="font-style:italic">- Components</span>: 2 fancy storage; 2,000 gp, 2 spaces.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">* Second Floor</span>: This area was originally more storage space, to insure that the wizard who built the tower could live as a recluse for months at a time without needing to worry about such piddling matters as restocking on food supplies. The Harmonium has since remodelled this floor into a barracks for its troop garrison here, reducing the time between supply runs to a matter of weeks.<br />
<span style="font-style:italic">- Components</span>: 1.5 barracks, 1 basic bath; 1,000 gp, 1.5 + 0.5 spaces.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">* Third Floor</span>: The general living space of the tower, this floor includes a pair of bedrooms originally intended for apprentices and currently home to the garrison's officers, as well as a sparse but functional kitchen.<br />
<span style="font-style:italic">- Components</span>: 1 basic bedrooms, 1 basic kitchen; 2,700 gp, 1 + 1 spaces.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">* Fourth Floor</span>: This area contains a library and laboratory workspace, used for magical research and study. Originally one of the key areas of the tower, it's since become less frequented, claimed mainly by the master of the tower and avoided by the garrison's troops except when necessary. Books here cover the topics of Knowledge (arcana), Knowledge (dungeoneering) and Knowledge (the Planes).<br />
<span style="font-style:italic">- Components</span>: 1 fancy library, 1 fancy magical laboratory; 9,000 gp, 1 + 1 spaces.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">* Fifth Floor</span>: The undeniable domain of the tower's owner and master, this floor acts as a living space and private refuge from the cares of the world. The top of the staircase opens into a small study, which functions also as a control space for the tower's locomotion; a door from the study leads into a good-quality bedroom suite and bath space.<br />
<span style="font-style:italic">- Components</span>: 1 basic study/office, 1 fancy bedroom suite, 1 basic bath; 5,600 gp, 0.5 + 1 + 0.5 spaces.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">* Locomotion</span>: Aur'Kenathai floats along the coast at a top speed of about 1/2 mile per hour. This allows it to cover some 12 miles per day - slow compared to ships, but quite rapid when compared to mundane strongholds. (3,000 + 8,500) x 15 = 172,500 gp.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">* Final Cost: 225,200 gp.</span></span></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

          The Desert of Uathein        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>In the remote eastern highlands of Karazam, far from any ocean, lie the desert lands of Uathein. A harsh, hard and unforgiven land, it has formed a natural boundary between Karazam and its eastern neighbors for as long as anyone can remember, and is home to a people who are insular, tough, and only nominally beholden to the Harmonium.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">The Land</span><br />
Uathein itself is a bleak and forbidding expanse of ragged stone - granites and feldspar, difficult to crack or weather and resistant to any sort of plant life. The general lack of moisture and precipitation only make this land more desolate, creating a vicious circle of isolation - lack of rain keeps plants from taking form to break apart the rock into soil, lack of soil means the few plant seeds that do blow here fail to take root.</p>

<p>There are a few instances in which life does blossom, though. Lichens, small mushrooms and other fungi can serve at the base of a scant ecosystem, able to cling somewhat to life even with so few natural resources. More prevalent is the autharei plant - a kind of vine that has sometimes been deemed 'desert kudzu' for its resilience, high ability to retain water and other nutrients, and rapid ability to grow to the limits of any cultivatable space and regrow after being damaged. Autharei is, in a sense, the keystone of any ecology in Uathein - one variety or another is usually the most commonly found plant, and those creatures able to feed off it are the dominant animal lifeform.</p>

<p>The one fortunate aspect of life in Uathein is that the lack of plant life and animals generally corresponds to a lack of predators and monstrous beasts. Though the land itself can be dangerous and difficult for humans to live in, it generally is the only threat to life and limb - other beings generally seek more hospitable climes.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">The People</span><br />
Sapient natives of Uathein are mainly of human stock, being short, dusky-skinned and wiry. Though not well-thought of by civilized standards, they are generally well versed in the unique needs of day-to-day survival in their own environment. Genasi kindred are also not unknown, mainly of earth and fire descent - some scholars think of these as descendants of the slaves of genie kindred, who fled to Ortho long ago, but little of such matters can be proven.</p>

<p>The natives of Uathein can be broadly divided into four kindreds:</p>

<p>* <span style="font-style:italic">The Settled</span> - Farmers and townsmen in the few areas of Uathein suitable for cultivating crops, these people have a safer and more predictable life than others in this land. They still face a strenuous, hardscrabble existence, with the need to keep their crops protected from scavengers and autharei out of their fields, and have extremely low productivity by the standards of more prosperous lands. Still, though, their endeavours are sufficient to support a bare minimum of crafts and industry, making them slightly more well-off than their neighbors in this bleak desert.</p>

<p>* <span style="font-style:italic">The Tribesmen</span> - These people are mostly nomadic, their lives centered around the herds of goats and similar draft animals. The beasts kept by Uathein tribesmen are as rugged and disagreeable as the land itself, able to feed off the autharei and other native plantlife and fed on by the tribesmen in return. These people are more or less what outsiders see as the archetypical native of this land - close-minded, knowingly ignorant of the outside world, and fairly xenophobic but extremely tough, and valued as fighters and scouts by provincial authorities. They possess an intolerant and orthodox worship of Didairdin and Rialondru that is nonetheless much admired by certain elements of the larger Temple hierarchy, and has offered many insights to theology on Ortho.</p>

<p>* <span style="font-style:italic">The Messengers</span> - Sometimes honored souls who have followed a calling to belong to no town or tribe, sometimes outcast criminals who are simply too skilled and respected to simply kill, the messengers live alone and travel across the desert of Uathein. They spread news, rumors, tales of great deeds and foul doings, and carry small valuables and services between those who'd otherwise not have any contact with one another.</p>

<p>* <span style="font-style:italic">The Learned</span> - A small caste within Uathein, and not well-trusted, this kindred is still too powerful to simply ignore or ridicule. Heirs to the regional traditions of wizardry, scholarship and other lore, the Learned live apart from others and pursue their own research, offering little in the most part for the things they consume but responding in ways that no one else can in times of crisis. Though the Learned study mainly matters of necromancy and transmutation, with an eye towards the latter for cruel and crippling reshapings of their subjects, they still have prospered with the coming of the Harmonium and exposure to the larger world. Only a cultural more of accepting apprentices only from within the Uathein tribes has kept the Learned as a kindred of the land, rather than dispersing into the larger society of Ortho.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Adventure Hooks</span><br />
* A member of the Messenger kindred, well-known to provincial magistrates in greater Karazam, has recently gone missing under mysterious circumstances.  Rumor suggests that foul play of some sort is involved, but exact names, locations and the like have never come to light - it's always "an acquaintance of an acquaintance".  The Karazam nobility wants such matters investigated, and the Messenger restored to good health - and if that means making waves among the Tribes or the Learned, uncovering an ancient and hidden evil that's slept for millenia beneath the stone, or hustling the Messenger out of Uathein ahead of a mob of enemies, then so be it...</p>

<p>* A religious war appears to be in the making amongst the Uathein tribesmen.  One side is arguing for the primacy of Rialondru in all matters, as indisputable head of the pantheon; the other promotes the greatness of Didairdin.  Left to themselves, things will inevitably turn to bloodshed and suffering.  The Harmonium authorities are absolutely uninterested in such a turn of events coming to pass, but can't intervene overtly - such action would only serve to delay hostilities, would make martyrs out of principals on <span style="text-decoration:underline">both</span> sides, and given the inhospitability of the Uathein desert might not succeed in the first place.  A discreet group of adventurers is needed to go in and make sure matters settle down, with a <span style="text-decoration:underline">minimum</span> of bloodshed.</p>

<p>What's worse, there's some indication that some outlander priests on both sides of the disagreement see the conflict as an earthly mirror of a similar debate occurring in heaven - and have quietly sent magical support to the side they favor among the tribesmen, in order to put a fix in.  If this is true, the region could be even more of a powderkeg, especially as none of the Uathein have any notion of how to safely employ modern war-magics.  Disarming any such zealots will be a vital step on the road to peace...</p>

<p>* The autharei plantlife has long been known as a dominant plant within the Uathein desert, but is relatively unknown in more settled and prosperous lands.  This is widely considered to be a blessing, as autharei is tough and tenacious enough to be difficult to uproot even in the barren, rocky desert - how swiftly it might spread in a less unforgiving clime is possibly unthinkable.  Now, though, the stuff's apparently been sighted off an island near Hazhkan - and unless something is done soon, it may overrun huge areas of landmass.  Guess who gets to travel to Uathein, and see if anyone knows how to permanently uproot autharei, and whether anyone had any ulterior motives for transplanting the stuff to Hazhkan...</p>

<p>* Uathein has been a refuge of the Lords of Law for centuries, although a harsh and poorly-understood one.  Now, though, there's rumors - that one or another of the Lords of Chaos, possibly Chal Ruinmaker or Jislana of the Dance, has started a cult among more remote of the Settled peoples.  Can such accusations be true?  What sort of hold is in place, to make the deeply devout Uathein welcome such a danger into their lives?  And how can such a threat be dealt with?  And why are the priests of Ina smiling?...</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

Are you picturing the Desert of Uathein occupying the entire eastern border of Karazam (roughly 2000 miles from Keln'in to the Great Northern Sea), the northern spur of the Flamedance Mts.

Uathein occupies as much of Karazam as is convenient.  <img src="http://planewalker.com/sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/wink.png" title="Eye-wink" alt="Eye-wink" class="smiley-content"/>  It's intended less to be a complete provincial writeup and more of a smaller subregion - interesting enough to draw some attention, not so sizeable that it has a major impact on the world at large.  Overall size probably works out to a few hundred miles on a side.</p>

<p>The Neverseen, meanwhile, could arguably be any alignment from True Neutral to Lawful Evil, depending on temperament and DM discretion.  Call it Neutral Evil as a default, but I'm not at all fussy.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

Overall size probably works out to a few hundred miles on a side.</div>
So I placed the Desert of Uathein in the northeastern corner of Karazam on my map (indicated as DoU on the map below), and will give a minor blurb on it in my Karazam write-up...</p>

I would recommend giving him a defined alignment and include an asterisked disclaimer indicating that the DM may opt for other alignments as fits their game...I figure that if a designer is gonna stat an NPC, they ought to go all the way...Even if they only indicate the bare minimum (race, class, level), alignment is often one of the bare minimums...I think players and DMs generally like to know how the designer defines the NPC...</p>

<p>So, here's the updated map of Ortho...I've indicated the 'sites' with initials so the map is a little less congested...I've also given the 'common tongue' names for the various bodies of water as opposed to local names (such as the Great Boreal Sea for the Great Northern Sea or the Sidero Sea for the Iron Sea)...<br />

         <p>So I edited the map above...I made the north polar region into a sea (Polar Sea?) instead of having the two northern continents (and possibly Province #3) meet; anyone opposed?...I also added Qijari as the provincial capital of Hazhkan as that is the only political place name I could find in the write-up; Eldersphinx, any problem with that?...<br />

Re the flooding - I think it has been noted that in some of the more populas cities that got flooded, the city simply built *up* - like Venice, piers, canals, and a ever optimistic hope that "We're not all gonna drown".  So those cities are still there.</p>

<p>Iathra is still recovering from it's domination under Alzrius.... as for capital... hm.</p>

<p>I'm sitting down (finally) to write up more on the provinces I've mucked around in - so expect me to edit this post over the next few hours.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

Just as Romhel of Voll, Jhary of Heka, Anju of Pan Thaera and Morgranhu of Iathra were the first heroes of the Harmonium and the Great War of Unification, so too were there others throughout the first century who epitomized the ideals of the new Ortho. Later, as the war moved around the world, these others would step to the fore to lead the forces of Harmony and embody the goals of the movement. The first four would be mirrored later in the war by these Latter Four and the combination of the two would be icons for Ortho’s Octave Council.</p>

<p>Thoughts?...Ideas on how to improve?...</div><br />
Pretty good - now, do we have a good reason why the new government would use people as the models in this case?</p>

<p>Did we have 8 the whole time, or was that more of something that came about after the Schism? If it was post-Schism then it could make sense if a laywer from one of the Schools of Ethics proposed it based on the ideals of history?</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

Just as Romhel of Voll, Jhary of Heka, Anju of Pan Thaera and Morgranhu of Iathra were the first heroes of the Harmonium and the Great War of Unification, so too were there others throughout the first century who epitomized the ideals of the new Ortho. Later, as the war moved around the world, these others would step to the fore to lead the forces of Harmony and embody the goals of the movement. The first four would be mirrored later in the war by these Latter Four and the combination of the two would be icons for Ortho’s Octave Council.</p>

<p>Thoughts?...Ideas on how to improve?...</div><br />
Pretty good - now, do we have a good reason why the new government would use people as the models in this case?</div><br />
For the same reason any culture has icons, models and heroes- For the ideal citizen, or in this case leader...The icons are the George Washingtons, Thomas Jeffersons, Brutuses, Cincinatuses, Alexanders, Solons, St. Peters, etc. of the various seats of the Octave Council...They are the ideals that whomever currently occupies those seats have to try to live up to, if not their deeds, then their drive and motivation [?]...</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;Clueless&#039;</em> wrote:</div>Did we have 8 the whole time, or was that more of something that came about after the Schism?</div>
The former was my assumption when I wrote the piece...If it was after the schism, the ideal would be even stronger as time would have diminished any flaws they may have had and focussed on their accomplishments and mystique (assuming there has been no de-mystification as has happened with, say, the U.S. Presidency)...</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;Clueless&#039;</em> wrote:</div>If it was post-Schism then it could make sense if a laywer from one of the Schools of Ethics proposed it based on the ideals of history?</div>
If this is the case, then it's the case...I have no problem with it if it is...Place it historically wherever it does the most good for the project...</p>

<p>Truth be told, I just wanted to write up some historical personages and took the Octave Council as the motivation...I got that damn degree in History and wanted to try to apply it to something in my life other than crossword puzzles, quiz shows and correcting my friends' ignorance...</p>

         <p>Ok,</p>

<p>Now that I'm up on the debate.... the peoples of Ulfrheim. Small, dark and pissy vs. tall, blond and pissy. (And we still have province #6 standing between Voll and Ulfrheim.) Hm. How's this for an idea. These people actually *are* the most 'mixed' of the provinces. Tall and blond, vs small and dark = medium and dark with throwbacks to either side. The 'Nordic knockoffs' conquered the areas south of them but Viking traits are distinctly recessive. Interbreeding, and movements of servant populations just about guarantees a good strong mix over time and if there was no real push to keep the populations separate with a strict caste system then you get that sort of blend by living in proximity. </p>

<p>I think the closest real life example we have to the situation is Britian. They went through a *lot* of german mercenaries, the Saxons, Jutes etc after the Romans withdrew in 400AD. The Britons were celtic, mostly dark haired from the descriptions of the time, the Germanic tribes blonder according to Caesar, toss in an invasion of other dark haired folks (Normans) and before too long you don't see much of the Nordic influence unless someone gets lucky and gets the recessive genes.</p>

<p>So. On with the show:</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">The Seaborn Exiles</span></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">We are born of the storm wind and the high wave. The froth is our blood. The depths hold our hearts. Our breath is salt. We find solace in our mother sea. Harsh discipline in her icy hands. High mountian or low grassland, we wash over the land at our will. We are her exiles. We are her children. We will return only at her invitation.<br />
- Song of an Exile, Ulfrheim poetry</span></p>

<p>The Seaborn are the closest thing to 'native' blood in the province of Ulfrheim. Traditionally tall and blond, they are now much more of a mix of many traits from the blood from southern peoples conquered in the distant pass, and the influence of their widely travelled populations. But a Seaborn is still a Seaborn, and the people of Ulfrheim recognize the call of their own blood, thin though it may be. Even now they are often found plying the sea in trade or patrol, travelling over the lands. The Seaborn say they were born to the land in the crevices of the rivers in the north (around province #6). They moved south in exile from the Mother Sea, always keeping to the coast, always sailing, but never returning to their true home. Their history as conquerers has always made the natives of #6 a little nervous, but the Ulfrheim have never shown interest in returning to the lands they claim birthed them.</p>

<p>Rumors hold that the Seaborn's legends of beign birthed from the sea are more than mere legend. The merfolk call the Ulfrheim brother, and recognize even the thinnest lines of the Seaborn blood as such. That the rare child is born blessed with the Mother's Gift as the Seaborn call it, adds crediance to the rumor. Those born with this Gift are naturally at home in the water - developing by adolecence plated red tinged gills remarkably simular to those of the more Southern merfolk.</p>

<p>It is said that the Seaborn are blessed on and in the water, and without a doubt that many of the best ships and crewmen come from this land. They rival the Thaeran in their familarity with the sea, especially that of northern and artic reaches, though ancient ships matching their designs have been found scattered nearly half a world away.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

Keep in mind that, as per <a href="forum_.html" class="bb-url">Ancient Omospondia and Parsadia</a>:</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Pertalos of Nisiprasinos, who convinced the Sea Devils of the Lykos (Wolf) Straits to seek their true homeland in the Southern Oceans, securing the sea lanes for his people.</div></p>

<p>This is not to say that Pertalos may not have Seaborn blood (mother was Seaborn?)...I have this picture in my mind that the Sahuagin have somehow been confined to the area around The Fogs, a buffer between the elven corpses of that area and the rest of Ortho (a sea elven curse perhaps?)...<br />

I meant to say 'just keep in mind that Pertalos 'drove' the Sahuagin south'...The Merfolk (a gender neutral term I prefer to Mermen) are also there (here and everywhere)...I figure that there existed an animosity between Sahuagin and Merfolk in ancient times (as per standard D&amp;D) and that when Pertalos rid the Wolf Straits of the Sea Devils, he helped both his people and the Merfolk (at least those in the area)...The Seaborn are you're baby and their links to the Merfolk are not in question (unless you want them to be)...</p>

<p>My take on the War Beneath the Waves, had the Harmonium allying the Sahuagin and Merfolk (and the Eyes-of-the-Deep, but that's been nixed due to Primus's opinion on the E-o-t-D's) against the Sea Elves and Tritons...This part of the Great War of Unification is, as yet, unchronicled, but strikes me as an important part of Ortho's History given the amount of water that's out there...</p>

Ah, come on Rip, this is D&amp;D3.5, where any thing and everything can exist anywhere and everywhere, where your neighbor on your right is a half-warforged dire moose and the one on your right is a greyhawk, er steel (or is that mercury) dragon, where nothing is world specific and where the Lady is LN...Open your eyes to the generic multiverse...</p>

<p>Okay, all kidding aside, I completely agree with you that the Yak-men are best placed in Zakhara (and the elemental plane of Earth) in the main, with individual world wanderers seeking goodies to help them play puppet-masters of the Land of Fate...</p>

I was just checking out your detailed map of Keln'in (see below) and was wonderin' what 'The Eye' is and if you were gonna write up the Temple of the Great Mother...Do the beholders worship the Great Mother or the Lords of Law?...Also, I'd think there'd be at least one major human town/city on the isle of Durgret...<br />

         <p>I see the beholders being far removed from the religous practices of the other races of Ortho, they probably hardly believe that the humans HAVE deities on their side - viewing such anthropomorphized helpful beings as being peculiar oddaments of the primitive Humanoid mind.</p>

<p>Durgret is a very large country-sized island so it probably has a number of cities... but I wasn't able to fit any in Photoshop and I added it on at the last minute.</p>

         <p>So, What Does the Harmonium Do on Ortho?</p>

<p>That is to say, what are the formal day-to-day activities and responsibilities of the Harmonium on Ortho?...I understand that they fulfill the role of federal military, but what else do they do?...Are they also the provincial or city police?...Are the majority of its members just reserves?...Or are they similar to a mega-corporation, funding various projects and employing their members to fulfill these projects?...Are they censors who review every written word or public exhortation to make sure it is in line with what's acceptable...I guess my basic question is, what do the Harmonium do besides acting as the military in a basically pacified world?...<br />

         <p>Military and police (and the various flavors of FBI and S.Service bodyguard duty) are a given.</p>

<p>A sizable number of them are probably off-Ortho or acting as support lines for off-Ortho military and peacekeeping campaigns. Someone has the stand in the back and make sure food shipments, etc. get sent.</p>

<p>Not all Harmonium members are fighters or warriors (in fact probably not even most) - many are experts in their fields or simply reservists. So - those who are not in private employement - aka those getting a Hardhead paycheck, probably serve for federal projects, such as:</p>

<p>Southern Continental Land Development <br />
*aka, running the Love Camps</p>

<p>Iatharan Land Recovery<br />
*recovering the ravaged lands of this province</p>

<p>Research and Development <br />
*DARPA style, which includes such things as Spelljamming research, Alchemical research, Anti-Tannari magical research etc.</p>

<p>Harmonium Engineering Corp. <br />
*Rebuilding flooding cities, buildings bridges, dams etc</p>

<p>Minimal Living Standards Department <br />
*forcing provinces to provide at least minimal living conditions for citizens of Ortho, food, and work programs (aka, recruitment)</p>

<p>Also we can't ignore that the Harmonium was originally constructed as a knightly order - so there's probably a healthy chunk of service and community work that the reserves do. At least for those who really fall into that mentality of serving Ortho.</p>

<p>Censorship is likely handled internally to each province - the ones where free press is allowed probably recieve extra attention from the Harmonium's Internal Affaris department, just to make sure news of certain things doesn't travel too far. Sudden discoveries of a mass burial ground of elven dead would provoke an *immediate* visit from the Harmonium equilivant of the MIB.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;Gerzel&#039;</em> wrote:</div>The Forest of J’hileos
A dark haunted place once revered by the elves, and now under a closely guarded quarantine.</p>

<p>The Forest of J’hileos is the site of an ancient Elvin temple complex built below ground and above of the living forest itself. Most of the forest has been clear-cut, cleansed and purified but the center temple complex and several outlying structures remain, despite the best efforts of the Harmonium.</p>

<p>The main site, the largest of the twelve quarantine areas lies on a hill with a depression at its northern end about eight miles from the limits of Ortho’s capitol city. The site is surrounded by a wall seventy feet high and at least as deep under ground made of solid granite blocks. The casing stones of the wall, on both sides, as well as below ground all have one of four protective runes carved into their outer surface and are polished. The wall has no gates or towers its crenelated top broken only by covered stone guard posts every eighth of a mile each with its own staircase down to the outside base.   Similar walls surround the other eleven sites and combined they cover around a hundred and eighty square miles that was originally the bounds of the destroyed forest city.</p>

<p>All freestanding structures permanent for more than a week within one half mile of the wall are required to be raised about one foot off the ground on a solid stone or fired-brick base.  This includes sign and fence posts and farmers can be fined for leaving a wooden ladder or wooden wagon wheels in place on the dirt soil ground for more than seven days.  Most of the subsidized farmers in the area triple this requirement for their own homes and are very observant of the law on their own even without the Harmonium patrols that guard the area.  Another law forbids the cultivation of any wooded plant-life, and requires that all trees in the area are to be chopped down and rooted out if possible with-in a week of their discovery; if it is not possible farmers are required to report the tree growth to one of the regular patrols.  The reason for all of this security is because of the lingering elven enchantments in the area.  All plants, including the grains and vegetables grown by the subsidized farm steads, grow at a drastically accelerated rate.  Farms often produce five to six times what comparable farms further away from the elven ruins.  However, trees grow faster than most plants, and will either start to form into buildings or more rarely form into the 'sentinals' that originally guarded the destroyed elven city.  It takes eight weeks for a sentinel to fully form and become mobile attacking the Harmonium patrols and farmers.  Wood objects left in contact with the soil will root and are more likely to become a sentinel rather than a building.  For every tree growing in the area there is a ninety-percent chance that it forms into a building, and a ten percent chance that it will form a sentinel.  For rooted wooden items such as a ladder or dropped farm implement the chance of becoming a sentinel increases by five percent.  For larger items such as wagons and small out-buildings this increase is ten percent and large buildings have a forty percent chance of becoming a sentinel.</div></p>

<p>I dunno if anyone's pointed this out yet (I haven't read through the whole thread yet), but when you have beholders on your side, destroying buildings is easy with that disinigrate eye beam.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">
