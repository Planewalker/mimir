        <div class="dice_rolls">
</div> <p>After much procatinating, here it is...</p>

<p>the objective of this thread is discussion into the creation of a coherent, unified Mesopotamian pantheon. This stems from my disagreement from the canon that the Sumerian and Babylonian Pantheons are separate, since by all accounts they are essentially the same gods.</p>

<p>I'll start by listing the canon pantheons, as appearing in On Hallowed Ground: <br />
Babylonian: <br />
-Anshar (CE)<br />
-Anu (LN)<br />
-Druaga (LE)<br />
-Girru (LG)<br />
-Ishtar (N)<br />
-Marduk (LN)<br />
-Nergal (NE)<br />
-Ramman (N)</p>

<p>Sumerian:<br />
-Enlil (NG)<br />
-Enki (LN) *dead*<br />
-Inanna (LE)<br />
-Ki (N)<br />
-Nanna-Sin (CG)<br />
-Nin-Hursag (N)<br />
-Utu (CG)</p>

<p>Now, I have several issues to raise with the canon presentation of he gods, in addition of the separation of pantheons:<br />
-Ki is apparently an earlier form/aspect of Ninhursag, but essentially the same deity.<br />
-Utu as CG. Utu (aka Shamash), in all the sources I've read, is described as god of the Sun, Justice and Law, and is the one who delegates the authority upon kings. Sounds pretty lawful to me. This is made worse by having all info from canon sources boiled down to indicating that he "is mad".   </p>

<p>(Most of my info comes from internet searches though, so there's a signifficant possibility it might be wrong)</p>

<p>Now we have one attempt at mashing together, from Sandstorm:<br />
-Anshar (CE)<br />
-Anu (LN)<br />
-Dahak (CE)*<br />
-Druaga (LE)<br />
-Enlil (NG)<br />
-Enki (LN) <br />
-Gilgamesh (NG)<br />
-Girru (LG)<br />
-Ishtar (N)<br />
-Ki (N)<br />
-Marduk (LN)<br />
-Nanna-Sin (CG)<br />
-Nergal (NE)<br />
-Utu (CG) </p>

<p>*Note: From what I've been able to gather, apparently Dahak was a figure from Zoroastrian, not Babylonian, mythos.</p>

<p>Finally we have Dragon Magazine 329, inspired by the Epic of Gilgamesh:<br />
-Adad (Ramman) (CN)<br />
-Anu (LN)<br />
-Belet-ili (Ninhursag) (NG)<br />
-Ea (Enki) (LG)<br />
-Enlil (LN)<br />
-Ereshkigal (LE)<br />
-Ishtar (Inanna) (CN)<br />
-Marduk (LG)<br />
-Nergal (CE)<br />
-Ninurta (NG)<br />
-Shamash (Utu) (LG)<br />
-Sin (Nanna) (N)</p>

<p>Note that this list uses the Akkadian naming. I've listed the Sumerian equivalents where appropiate. Alsonote the changes in alignment for several deities. These seem to reflect better on the god's nature, from what I've been able to glean (ie, Ishtar as a fickle, capricious deity; or Shamash as the patron of Justice)</p>

<p>So, with these examples at hand, which one do you feel is a more faithful protrayal of this pantheon? Or would you propose an entirely different one? I'm open to "artistic" license, as long as it's justified in a convincing matter. Those knowledgeable in mythology are especially welcome/sought after.</p>

<p>There is a further question in this issue. In the purpouse of keeping some continuty, I'll assume Gilgamesh will be considered a power. Since FR's Gilgeam is obviously Gilgamesh, what should be the take in building the pantheon? In FR canon, he became corrupted, (switch to LE), and eventually was slain by Tiamat. However it's stressed several times that that was his avatar, cut off from his godly essence in the outer planes. Would his planar, "greater" essence have become corrupted like his earthly avatar did? Should he be considered "killed off for real" by Tiamat?</p>       </div>

         <p>Despite my interest in non-classical pantheons, I don't know enough about the Summerians/Babylonians to even hazard a guess at most of this. I may have to come back to this on the weekend when I can spend several hours on Wikipedia, etc.</p>

<p>Regarding Gilgamesh (the only character I feel knowledgable enough to even hazard a take), I agree that the Gilgamesh of the classic "Epic of..." wouldn't be LE (although I could see the argument that he acted rather neutral once he became obsessed with his fear of death and his quest for immortality).</p>

<p>But ultimately, this falls back to the question of how does one handle gods-on-earth. I typically avoid placing avatars on my world as I like to keep my deities distant and a little mysterious/unfathomable. But if it is done, I suppose that the avatar could be viewed in one of (at least) two ways:<br />
1) the avatar is just a mini-version (or manifestation) of the god and behaves EXACTLY as the god does would in the same situation<br />
2) by taking a physical/mortal form (I say "mortal" as it is possible - though difficult - to kill an avatar), the deity is imbueing a portion of his energy into a semi-autonomous being (even if it one created on the spot). <br />
If you take the later approach, it might be conceivable for this manifestation to veer in a different direction/alignment than the deity. This wouldn't be a common occurance, but it could be possible . Similarly, the avatar could be killed (with the deity just "losing" that portion of his divine energy - so killing off a large number of avatars of the same deity in different spheres - or whatever division one applies to how many avatars can operate at a time- might knock that god down a ranking)<br />
Think of it like the character of Multiple Man in the comics. He can create duplicates of himself that he can later re-absorb (and gain their knowledge); but the duplicates he creates often have different personalities and motivations than the original. <br />
As you implied, it also raises the question as to whether a corrupted avatar introduces corruption back into the deity itself. If so, I could see it being a major goal of fiends to corrupt these avatars (and to a lesser extent, the angelic might try to convert the avatars of the less noble gods) as these avatars are a weaker (from an alignment/morality point-of-view) form of the normally unassailable deity</p>

<p>Personally, I think that if I had avatars running around prominently on a world, I choose the later option as it seems to allow for a lot more plot ideas. But I understand if DMs would choose the former to maintain a consistancy in the gods<br />
In the case of Gilgamesh, if the avatar from the Realms turned evil and the one from the "real world" turned neutral; perhaps the main god is starting to drift in terms of his alignment and portfolios (or desired portfolios)</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>If I remember correctly, the reason Gilgamesh/Gilgeam had an Avatar on Toril was because of the whole mess with the Imaskari, and for some reason he neglected/decided not to rejoin his greater Essence in the Outer Planes.</p>

<p>So you think we should keep the planar Gilgamesh alive and on his original alignment?</p>

<p>Another thing I forgot to mention: Is there any mention of Assuran/Hoar in a non-FR source? I've been debating wether to include him as part of the pantheon, but haven't found any other sources on him, so I'm inclined to leave him as a FR-exclusive god.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>mos_anted</em> wrote:</div> This stems from my disagreement from the canon that the Sumerian and Babylonian Pantheons are separate, since by all accounts they are essentially the same gods.</div></p>

<p>Well, okay. The people responsible for the split, James Ward and Robert J. Kuntz (the authors of 1st edition <span style="font-style:italic">Deities &amp; Demigods</span>) admitted in that book that they had exaggerated the differences between the two pantheons. I have no idea why they bothered, but apparently they thought it was better to have two pantheons than one. Colin McComb did the best he could with it in <span style="font-style:italic">On Hallowed Ground</span>, inventing a story in which the Sumerian pantheon sort of "budded" into the Babylonian pantheon as the Mesopotamians became more sophisticated and more concerned with law and order than nature, Inanna splitting into Inanna and Ishtar, Enki splitting into Enki and Ea, and so on. And the two pantheons decide there's not room for both of them on any one world, so they've been at odds ever since.</p>

<p>I kind of like it, actually. It's not really "historical" to have the Sumerian and Babylonian pantheons at odds with their own dopplegangers, but it's an interesting situation, more interesting than having just one pantheon. And really, when you think about it, where do you draw the line? Ishtar isn't just Inanna, after all - she also becomes Astarte and Atargatis and Ashtoreth and Aphrodite and Isis and Venus and Magna Mater and Cybele and many others, and if you can't justify Ishtar and Inanna as separate deities, how can you justify Ishtar and Aphrodite as separate deities when they're both goddess of love and war worshiped in the same general area with some of the same myths told about them? They all blur together along the edges, but at some point, nigh-identical deities must develop aspects different enough from the original that they become independent entities in their own right.

<p>Well, Gilgamesh is given as one of his aliases in <span style="font-style:italic">Powers &amp; Pantheons</span>, and if you look at the list of real Mesopotamian mythological figures, Gilgamesh is the only one Gilgeam could be, but... I don't like that interpretation. I see Gilgeam as a purely local Torilian deity, the son of Enlil's Torilian avatar named after a favored hero from Enlil's world of origin. I think it makes more sense than Gilgamesh's avatar hitching a ride on Enki's magic boat over Toril and taking over after most of his fellow travelers died or left.

<p>Not in Planescape, but in the Forgotten Realms setting. And I agree. The whole point of the Gilgamesh myth is that he strives for immortality and fails. Letting him become a god would be like creating a version of Hera that was fine with Zeus's affairs and illegitimate offspring.</p>

<p>They're similar in spirit, but if you went with that you'd have to explain why a Greek goddess changed gender and teamed up with the Mesopotamians. This doesn't strike me as a tremendously useful comparison, unless you have an awesome story idea involving Nemesis getting fed up with the Greeks and changing pantheons, who for some reason won't accept another goddess but are fine with another god. There are lots of examples of gods of different pantheons that are similar to one another, and really what else are you going to call Hoar's specialty priests? Avengers? Justicars? "Nemesis," besides being a Greek goddess, is of course an English word, and a very appropriate one, but I wouldn't read it as implying that Hoar is secretly a transgender Olympian.</p>

<p>It fits better, I think, to associate Assuran (the Untheric name for Hoar) with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assur" class="bb-url">Assur</a>, patron god of Assyria. Wikipedia says he's similar to Marduk, but really you can match him with Anshar (the father of Anu) pretty readily. In my mind Anshar, cast from his throne by the ascension of his son Anu, became obsessed with vengeance and retribution after mulling over the unfairness of his situation.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>I kind of like it, actually. It's not really "historical" to have the Sumerian and Babylonian pantheons at odds with their own dopplegangers, but it's an interesting situation, more interesting than having just one pantheon. And really, when you think about it, where do you draw the line? Ishtar isn't just Inanna, after all - she also becomes Astarte and Atargatis and Ashtoreth and Aphrodite and Isis and Venus and Magna Mater and Cybele and many others, and if you can't justify Ishtar and Inanna as separate deities, how can you justify Ishtar and Aphrodite as separate deities when they're both goddess of love and war worshiped in the same general area with some of the same myths told about them? They all blur together along the edges, but at some point, nigh-identical deities must develop aspects different enough from the original that they become independent entities in their own right. This is just an example of that happening, maybe a little too quickly and geographically close than a lot of people are comfortable with, but so what? It's fiction.</p>

<p>If you do want a more "historical" Mesopotamian pantheon, though, I'd just use the one from the Dragon article you quote. I'd ignore Sandstorm, which I think mixes Sumerian, Babylonian, and Zorastrian figures in an unhelpful way.<br />
</div></p>

<p>Rip: thanks for you input! It is much appreciated. I did take a peek into the original D&amp;D, and I remember a small note somewhere that said the same thing.<br />
IMC it's just something that bugs me from the way it was presented. Though I understand Ishtar might have evolved/inspired further female/love deities like Isis and Aphrodite, I just take a more "simplistic" view of pantheons, and draw the line at parts where it's easily recognizable: you can differentiate pretty easily the Greek gods from the Egyptians from the Babylonians. Otherwise you're right, we'd only have about one dozen deities at all, worshipped under about a hundred different names.<br />
I'm not sure what is it, but it was the way it was presented that bugs me. It would've been better, IMO, if the original pantheon would've evolved into a more "civilized" one, for example.</p>

<p>Though I did come up with a somewhat intereting idea if we take the canon presentations of both pantheons.. perhaps the hostilities between pantheons got to the point where both were at risk of extinction, and grudgingly, the surviving gods agreed to merge into a single pantheon, resulting in something like the one presented in Sandstorm (Enki's death could be retconned, or perhaps it's Ea, Enki's babylonian doppleganger)</p>

<p>Perhas my issue is that i'm working on them from a "background" POV, so huge upheavals like that tend to not go down well with what I'm aiming to. Still, I think it might not be too much of a stretch to just switch that "Chaotic" over to "Lawful" and drag his realm to Mechanus/Arcadia/Celestia from Arborea. Another possibility could be to just delete "Justice" from his portfolio and leave him as a Sun God, similar to Apollo.</p>

<p>YMMV, I was planning on Gilgamesh getting a treatment similar to Heracles, either a divine agent or minor godling, perhaps after his death, having learned his "lesson" (I remember reading that after failing one last time in achieving immortality, Gilgamesh realized that it is through it's legacy that man achieves eternal life) he was elevated by the pantheon? After all he was 67% god already.</p>

<p>As I said before, WoG confirmed Gilgeam is Gilgamesh, though I agree with your take Rip, and think that might be a much tidier solution without muddying the "bigger picture". After all, who cares what a minor godling was up to in some backwater Prime?</p>

<p>This is interesting: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anshar" class="bb-url">This</a> supports your take Rip. Personally I like it a lot, gives some personality to an otherwise bland/faceless character, though it clashes with the existing canon. I'll see if I can give it a spin and come up with some way to reconcile them.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I also really enjoyed the split of the Sumerian and Babylonian pantheons. It's something that's touched on elsewhere in d&amp;d but never to this extent. I've always enjoyed the perspective that each of the real-world pantheons has one "home" prime material where their worship is strongest -- the Olympeans have Gaea, the Norse have Midgard, so on and so forth -- and on their respective prime, their creation myths are actually "the truth." Inevitably these gods are going to spread their faiths, though, sometimes all together as a united pantheon, and not all cultures are going to worship these gods in the same way. You have an infinite number of Prime Material spheres, and so conceivably an infinite number of variations on the same gods, worshipped with different rituals under different names but still essentially the same. In addition to Gaea, where the worship of Zeus and Hera is practised, you could have a prime based on the Roman Empire, where they are known as Jupiter and Juno.</p>

<p>The Sumerian and Babylonian gods are an interesting example of a situation where the culture and worship on one of these worlds grows so different from the original gods that the belief of those worshippers forces the gods to split into two different pantheons -- one "primitive" and the other "civilized." Could this happen to other pantheons? Heck yeah, you could you run a game where Jupiter is a serious threat to Zeus' power.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>The firstborn of Tiamat and Apsu, Lahmu and Lahamu are serpentine creatures, parents of all the gods of Babylon. Older than the titans of Olympus, older than Gaea and Uranus, almost unimaginably old in one of the most ancient assemblages of divinities known, they were the first creatures of comparative order to exist in their pantheon; it was their perception that caused Tiamat, Apsu, and Mummu to separate into independent entities capable of being imprisoned or destroyed. </p>

<p>Although they were allies of their descendents Marduk and Ea during the war against their mother Tiamat, they felt they had little place in the new order the gods created. They bowed gracefully out and volunteered to protect the True Words that they believed they had been the first to perceive. To aid them they created beasts in their own image, the wraithworms, descendents of whom are still found in the Beastlands and beyond. The first wraithworms, however, remain with their parents beneath the sands of Amun-thys. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, as the eons stretched on, as their realm crumbled to nothing, as the entire layer turned to waste, as the first eladrins spawned from snow and dust, the Lahama began to dwindle and fade. Without worship to sustain them they began to forget themselves, and to forget the purpose for which they had come to this place so long ago. As their power declined from the rank of greater gods to mere demigods, they fell into a deep sleep. Their children have not yet been able to wake them up. Most likely it is only the power of the True Words that sustains them at all. </p>

<p>Druaga was originally Aryaman, a son of the Vedic goddess Aditi. It was his role to bring sacrifices to fruition. When his brother Varuna inspired the prophet Zarathustra to create a faith honoring Varuna alone, Aryaman and the other Vedic gods - particularly Indra - were furious. Among the Dravidian pantheons they were assimilating they spread the idea that Varuna was a master of demons, not fit to be worshipped. Only Mitra sided with his brother Varuna, and as a result was rewarded with a favorable mention in the new holy texts. Varuna - now known as Ahura Mazda by his chosen people -  retaliated by teaching his prophet that Aryaman was a personifications of utter evil. A war of words followed, but the end result was that Varuna lost his preeminent place among the Vedic gods, the asuras who followed him were banished to the inner planes, and a new god was created: Ahriman, also known as Druaga, every bit as evil as the Zoroastrians believed him to be. A new aspect of Indra was reduced to the status of one of Ahriman’s many fiendish servitors.</p>

<p>Trapped within the constraints of his myth, Druaga, born from Aryaman, warred endlessly against his brother. It was horribly tedious and futile. When Ea son of Anu arrived with a proposition - help us keep Ahura Mazda away from our worshippers and we’ll make you a member of our own pantheon - Druaga found it irresistibly tempting. At last, an opportunity to write his own myth once again! Freedom from Zarathustra and his crumbling scrolls! Perhaps, one day, even redemption.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the cult of Druaga is vile and ugly, characterized by human sacrifice and the summoning of baatezu. The Lords of the Nine are delighted with this development, and do what they can to encourage Druaga’s new worshippers to follow their path. Worshippers of the Babylonian pantheon are taught that Druaga was a creation of Tiamat’s who sided with the gods. Druaga actually has no particular animosity toward Tiamat, but he plays along.</p>

<p>Girru is the son of Anu and his sister-wife Antu, making him the brother of Ea. He is a crusader of righteousness and the messenger of the gods. He didn’t take it well when his pantheon allowed the tattered remnants of the Zoroastrian pantheon to join them; to him, the unholy bargain with Druaga was an unacceptable compromise, going far beyond any perceived need for “balance.” Because his father has forbidden him from attacking Druaga directly, he works against the diabolic lords Druaga is allied with, hoping to undermine the so-called “Lord of the Devil World” by reducing the number of minions he has access to. Girru hopes that if Druaga is caught short, Anu will be obliged to end their pact. Therefore, Girru sends the astral devas in his service to disrupt the baatezu roads and supply lines leading to Druaga’s realm. </p>

<p>Girru is served by many mortal paladins.</p>

<p>Anshar has fallen far since the days when he was king of heaven, king of all the gods. He is the oldest of their number, the first true god to be born from the children of Tiamat and Bahamut, the offspring of Io. Always violent by nature, he urged his grandson Ea to kill his grandmother Tiamat at a time when Ea favored diplomacy.</p>

<p>When Anshar’s dominion as lord of the sky was taken from him by his son Anu, he retreated to Pandemonium and founded his City of Eternal Darkness, there to honor the infinite night before the birth of Shemesh the sun during Anu’s reign. </p>

<p>Over time, Anshar has shrank in power and influence, dwindling from a greater god to a lesser one. Kishar, his sister and wife, has disappeared entirely, existing only as an astral corpse. Anshar, however, is not one to merely mourn his fate and accept it. He created his own pantheon, the Assyrian, where as Ashur he became the primary god of the sky and war, with Ishtar as his consort. Those were grand days, but the Assyrian pantheon was weakened by the rise of the Zoroastrian gods. Ishtar, always one to go wherever the wind was most favorable, left him for new lovers.</p>

<p>Out of pure spite, he conspired with the god Nergal to slay the Sumerian god Enki. Unlike many gods known in Babylon, Anshar had no Sumerian counterpart, but Enki was one of the most ancient and powerful Sumerian gods still alive. They lured him into the Abyss and ambushed him, hungrily drinking the divine ambrosia of his blood in the hope it might prolong their own miserable existences.</p>

<p>Out of loneliness and fear he has invited a goddess from a foreign pantheon - Eloéle, a goddess of night - to dwell with him in his stygian abode. Other members of his pantheon suspect her of gold-digging, fearing the rising goddess might wrest control of the City of Eternal Darkness from its creator. Those who know Anshar better - and few outside his realm do - notice Eloéle’s memory and personality seem to be fading. Night after night in the endless night, she becomes more pliable to Anshar’s will. It seems likely that the ancient god is somehow devouring her mind from within, and ultimately Eloéle will become merely another aspect of Anshar.</p>

<p>A few similar elder gods from the Olympian pantheon - the titans Astraeüs, Phoebe, Pallas, and Coeus - have cultivated relationships with Anshar from their Tarterian exile. With a similar affinity toward darkness and resentment, the titans hope to find out how Anshar is managing his trick of assimilating a younger god. Perhaps that could be their ticket out of their cage. Anshar actually has more in common with Uranus, the titans’ father, but he is willing to take what help he can get at this point.</p>

<p>Anshar has attempted cultivating an alliance with the goblinkin deity Stalker, an elder god of hate, death, darkness and cold. Thus far, all of Anshar’s messengers have been killed. Anshar does not mind much - the messengers were picked because of their disposability - but he has given up on the idea for now. In any case, Stalker hasn’t been seen in the planes for some time.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that he is only two generations removed from the Draconic pantheon, Anshar has no connections with it. He hates dragons with at least as much passion as his great-grandson, Marduk, but the dragon gods mostly consider him to be beneath notice.</p>

<p>Anshar is worshipped by a few in the worlds where the Assyrian culture once held sway, but his cult has mostly been driven underground. Thieves, assassins, and other denizens of the night hold him in the highest regard. Anshar has embraced this aspect of his worship, and has taken to encouraging illicit acts through his clerics and proxies.</p>

<p>==========================</p>

<p>The Sumerian pantheon was born from Nammu, the primordial waters. From Nammu was born An the sky and Ki the earth. From An and Ki was born Enlil, Lord of the Winds, and Ninhursag, Lady of the Mountain. Then, dreaming in the waters of Nammu was born Enki, Lord of the Earth and Sea, awakened at last by Ninhursag, Lady of the Mountain, goddess of birth.</p>

<p>Enlil and his wife Ninlil begat Nanna-Sin. Inanna, Ereshkigal, and Utu were children of Nanna-Sin and Ningal. </p>

<p>=================================<br />
The Babylonian pantheon was born from the Sumerian one, though it has grown more complex, more concerned with matters of order and law. In Babylonian myth the first sentient beings were Apsu, fresh water personified, and Tiamat the salt water. Together they created Mummu, the waves, and two younger beings, the first dragons: Lahmu and Lahamu. In the beginning Apsu, Tiamat, and Mummu were one, pure chaos with nothing to differentiate one from the other. Lahmu and Lahamu were the first to know Words, and Number, and with that power they separated their parents and their brother, giving them draconic forms like their own. </p>

<p>They who were born of Chaos did not thank the newcomers for this favor.</p>

<p>Lahmu and Lahamu then stared into the primal void and, with the power of Words and Number, they created two new things: Kishar and Anshar, who would become rulers of the earth and the sky. Anshar and Kishar begat Anu, Antu, and Ki. </p>

<p>On his sister Antu, Anu begat Ea and Damkina.  On his sister Ki, Anu begat Enlil and Ninlil.</p>

<p> The descendents of Lahmu and Lahamu were the gods. With the power of word and number they began to order the universe according to their individual bents.</p>

<p>This was physically painful for the eldest born of Chaos. Apsu in particular raged at the constraints and boundaries his grandchildren were creating. In the old days he could do anything, be anything. Now with each moment the gods wove their logocentric web he grew weaker, more limited, less himself.</p>

<p>In rage fueled by desperation, Apsu conferred with his watery, mercurial kind. The new gods, he argued, must be destroyed before they changed their ancestors’ very being forever.  Mummu agreed, but Tiamat was not so sure. Up to this point, nothing had been destroyed. They had only ever created and transformed. Destruction seemed a form of limitation; wouldn’t it be another form of the very crime they sought to prevent?</p>

<p>Anshar, meanwhile, was trying to persuade his children of this very eventuality. </p>

<p>Mummu argued no - destruction could actually be a form of creation. Perhaps it was even the truest form. Apsu found this convincing. Soon, he assured his favored offspring. Soon we will strike.</p>

<p>It was not to be. Ea the all-knowing heard their speech through the waters. Ea the greatest of magi used the power of word and number to entangle the elder gods in sleep. Ea the binder of demons created a magic circle from word and number to hold them fast forever, fixing them in a single static form. Ea the slayer of demons killed Apsu and made his skull into his throne. Mummu was imprisoned in a demiplane of Ea’s creation, a circular prison intended to last until the end of time.</p>

<p>Now the deed was done. Destruction had happened. Death had happened. Tiamat grew twisted with rage and grief. Perhaps, she thought, destruction really was the only beauty left to her. She began to spawn twisted abominations, things that had been wild imaginings in the time before creation and now were hard reality, fixed and grim like herself: the first dragons, manticores, chimeras, sphinxes, wemics, dragonnes, basilisks, giants, death dogs, centaurs, bariaurs, lamias, scorpion-folk. Fiends.</p>

<p>You must slay her too, counseled Anshar, oldest of the gods. Anshar, lord of sky, lord of night. </p>

<p>That didn’t go too well last time, Ea pointed out. I’m thinking it should be a last resort. What if Tiamat and her new spawn were our allies? </p>

<p>During the time Ea was stalling, he was also creating a child of his own: Marduk. Ea used his powers to enhance Marduk’s senses and abilities. He trained his son personally, and when he was ready Marduk girded on the magical arms his father had made him, and summoned wind elementals to aid him against Tiamat’s hordes.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">It’s dragon season,</span> said Marduk son of Ea. </p>

<p>According to the myths, Marduk killed Tiamat that day, splitting her in two from the inside. Yet it is also true that Tiamat survived in her aspect as a member of the draconic pantheon, and continued to harass her foe from time to time. </p>

<p>For a long time after that, the Babylonian pantheon was more or less stable. Lahmu and Lahamu retreated to the desert waste of Arborea’s fourth layer, there to guard the True Words with their serpent brood until the end of time. Ea taught his son further, and from the blood and body of Tiamat’s general Kingu, Marduk created the race of humans to empower them with their worship and sacrifices. New gods and spirits were born, and others (like Tammuz, consort of Ishtar) died.</p>

<p>Then came the Zoroastrian pantheon. Why Ahura Mazda and his celestial hosts decided to gun for the same lands held by worshippers of the Babylonian gods is clear: they simply sprang from similar climes. </p>

<p>The Zoroastrian faith proved extremely, insidiously popular, catching fire in the Babylonian lands so quickly that the pantheon found their worshippers disappearing much faster than they could recruit more. Dependent on mortals as they had become, they feared they would soon face extinction.</p>

<p>Ea, as ever, had a plan. He approached Druaga, Ahura Mazda’s archnemesis, and offered to make a deal: if Druaga would agree to ally his diabolic hosts with the children of Anu, Druaga could become an official member of their pantheon, granted worship equal to that of any other god. A chance to humiliate Ahura Mazda and to achieve the respectability and open worship he craved: how could Druaga say no? </p>

<p>Today Druaga works hand in hand with the Babylonians, helping to fend off the celestials of Ahura Mazda in return for a place of honor in every temple. Many of the other gods are infuriated by this: Girru, in particular, doesn’t take the baatezu walking openly through the realms of his fellow gods well. The human sacrifices to Druaga haven’t done anything positive for the mortal cultures either. Anu has decreed that it be so, though, and so it is. </p>

<p>Ellil was born from the Sumerian god Enlil. As Enlil’s worshippers became more urbanized and concerned with laws, the Babylonian pantheon was born from the Sumerian, and so Ellil was separated from his older aspect, becoming a completely separate entity. The Sumerian Enlil had been neutral good, mostly concerned with wind and war, but this new deity was more concerned with order than anything else. </p>

<p>In Babylonian/Akkadian myth, Ellil was born from the exhausted breath of Anu and the earth goddess Urash, shortly after their sexual union. Born from breath, he was wind itself, the firmament, the force that separated Earth from Heaven. </p>

<p>By his wife Ninlil, Ellil is the father of the moon-god Sin and the thunder-god Ramman. The fire-god Girru is his half-brother, the full brother of Ea, but Ellil does not hold this against him and Girru has no problem with Ellil. </p>

<p>It is commonly held, in some circles, that Ellil is the real leader of the Babylonian pantheon, that old Anu is merely a ceremonial figure at this point and everyone takes direction from his son. This has some truth to it, though few would ignore the advice of clever Ea. If Ellil is the power behind the throne, Ea is the power behind that power. </p>

<p>Ellil and Ea, however, are great rivals. Ea believes he should have been given rulership of the sky, since his mother Antu is older than her sister Urash. When Ellil sent a flood to wipe out mortals (disliking their violation of his laws), Ea saved some of them in an ark. When Ishtar defied the laws of the gods by entering the Underworld, Ea rescued her. When the pantheon allied itself with Druaga, Ea didn’t give Ellil any credit for the idea (not that he deserved any). Ellil thinks of Ea as a law-scoffing nuisance, while Ea thinks of Ellil as a usurper. Ea’s son Marduk, well-respected among the gods as the defeater of Tiamat, tends to side with his father, something that irks Ellil to no end. His grandaughter Ishtar, too, treats Enlil as the more favored of her two grandfathers. Despite Ellil’s efforts, Ea’s place as the power behind the power seems assured. </p>

<p>As their holdings elsewhere were being devoured by the Zoroastrian pantheon, Ellil was among those who sought worshippers on the world of Toril, where some of his faithful had been enslaved. Known by the older name Enlil there, Ellil managed to get an avatar passed the barrier mortals had made against his kind. The avatar ruled as a god-king, head of the pantheon called the Untherian by the locals, and even sired a semi-divine offspring, one Gilgeam. Though many of the other avatars were killed by members of the Orcish pantheon, Ellil survived. Ultimately, though, Ellil made the calculated decision that the cost of maintaining an avatar was using more of his divine power than he was gaining from the paltry few worshippers the nation of Unther had to offer. In a typically pragmatic move he abandoned the world, leaving Gilgeam to rule in his stead. </p>

<p>The older Enlil is infuriated by his inadvertent creation, so cold, so mechanical, and so willing to steal Enlil‘s own worshippers. More warlike than his Babylonian equivalent, Enlil seeks to destroy Ellil’s proxies whenever he can. Normally, he works through agents; he isn’t ready for a godswar. At least, not quite yet. </p>

<p>Ellil's realm in Mechanus is a ziggurat on top of a mountainous cog. This cog adjoins Anu's; it is of equal size, and the two wheels turn at the same rate.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Well, wether or not the Ahriman&gt;Asmodeus connection is true, he could either a) be the same wily ol' Devil, using another name, or b) have a secondary aspect/avatar, with a realm in Dis even, with no-one, not even the other Lords, aware of the connection.

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>So I went diggin for more material to get ideas from. These two sources were particularly useful: <br />
<a href="http://www.pantheon.org/areas/mythology/middle_east/mesopotamian/" title="http://www.pantheon.org/areas/mythology/middle_east/mesopotamian/">http://www.pantheon.org/areas/mythology/middle_east/mesopotamian/</a><br />
and<br />
<a href="http://www.myths.com/pub/myths/assyrbabyl-faq.html" title="http://www.myths.com/pub/myths/assyrbabyl-faq.html">http://www.myths.com/pub/myths/assyrbabyl-faq.html</a></p>

<p>but the greatest stroke of inspiration came from reading Rifts' Pantheons of the Megaverse. Althought it was written for the Palladium system, It's material is, at least concept-wise, incredibly PS-friendly, and there are some eery interesting ideas there. I'd recommend it to anyone working with pantheons and powers.</p>

<p>So I got the following ideas (please forgive the formatting, I'm not really a writer and suck at it, so I'm wirting the ideas more or less as I got them)</p>

<p>-Apsu: One of the Creator beigns of the Mesopotamian mythology, along with Tiamat. Put to sleep and slain by Enki when he found out Apsu was planning to kill the Anunnaki (the sons of Anu). I took some ideas form Pantheons of the Megaverse, in making Apsu a true Eldritch Abomination, a beign far removed from what later gods would be, akin to the Greek Protogenoi. Maybe he was one of the beigns who gave birth to the current Multiverse?. I found an uncanny resemblance in his fate and that of other Elder beigns, like Cronus, Uranus and Tharizdun. Apsu could be dead, his divine corpse floating through the Astral. But what if Enki was not able to kill him? What if he only managed to incapacitate and seal him? Perhaps he is imprisoned in one of the lost caverns of Agathion, in Pandemonium. <br />
-Tiamat: Apsu's consort, she fought and was defeated by Marduk. Though it is believed Marduk killed her and formed the Earth and Heaven out of her body, the truth is she survived, but she was left weakened enough she was "demoted" to Lesser deity status. She took her leave from the Mesopotamian Pantheon, turning to the Prime world of Krynn, where, under the name of Takhisis, she managed to regain much of her power, climbing back to the ranks of Greater goddess. On Krynn is also where she ran afoul of Paladine/Bahamut, sparking an enmity that has extended to the present day across multiple planes and worlds.<br />
-Anshar (Lesser god): former king of the gods and father of Anu, now bitter and resentful after beign displaced by his son.<br />
-Anu (Intermediate god): King of the gods after Anshar, abdicated in favor of Enlil as he grew disinterested in worldly afairs. Now counsels Marduk in his role as King of the gods.<br />
-Dahak (Demigod): AKA Kingu/Kingsu, Tiamat's son, who led the demonic forces arranged against the Annunaki. After his and Tiamat's defeat, he was cast down into the Wells of Darkness in the Abyss, trapping him. With the weakening of the Mesopotamian pantheon, he has managed to reach beyond his prison, exerting some influence and attracting priests to his worship.<br />
-Druaga (Greater god?): Taking int oaccoutn he fact that Druaga was another name for Ahriman, and the Twin Serpents myth; Asmodeus is working under this alias to increase his power/influence without drawing the attention of his nemesis, Jazirian/Ahura Mazda.<br />
-Enlil (Intermediate god): King of the gods after Anu, he abdicated in favour of Marduk as part of a deal when Marduk took care of Tiamat and her hordes. Still present in advisor position to Marduk.<br />
-Enki (Intermediate or Greater god?): Killed/sealed Apsu and fathered Marduk to face Tiamat. Could be considered Marduk's vizier, god of knowledge, magic and water, with a soft spot for humanity (I'll just ignore the part where he was killed ^^)<br />
-Girru (Lesser god): Not much change here, I think. A good god, unflinching in his crusade against evil.<br />
-Ishtar (Greater goddess): the immensely popular goddess of love and war. Probably going by the book on this one too ^^<br />
-Belet-ili (Greater goddess): Goddess of nature and the earth, has kept herself pretty much aloof of the godly politics, tending to her charges. (I'm considering making her the result of Ki and Nin-hursag merging together)<br />
-Marduk (Greater god): Crowned as King of the gods as part of a gambit by his father Enki after he beat back Tiamat and his hordes. The god of rulership and civilization.<br />
-Nanna/Sin/Nanna-Sin? (Lesser god): A fickle yet good natured deity, not caring much for the edicts of Enlil, the situation that did not change with Marduk's rise to power. Still he is an unflinching foe of evil, and will rally to calls to fight back any threat ot the pantheon and its worshippers.<br />
-Nergal &amp; Ereshkigal (Lesser and Intermadiate god, respectively): The gods of death, destruction and the underworld. They remained a neutral party during the war against Tiamat. They still maintain an adversarial relationship to the rest of the pantheon (Nergal particulary likes to antagonize Marduk)<br />
-Ramman (Lesser god): God of storms and thunder. Again I don't think much tinkering is necessary here.<br />
-Utu (Intermediate god): God of the sun. I'm debating wether to leave him CG, or switch him to LG and drop his realm in Mechanus ^^</p>

         <p>I don't believe this will mesh well with traditional Summerian/Babylonian myth; but your summation does raise some questions/possibilities in my mind for possible campaign ideas and story lines:<br />
-Apsu must have been really horrible if Tiamat was originally just his consort (i.e. implication of her being a relatively passive partner in the marriage)</p>

<p>-Your summation of Tiamat's history opened up ideas of Tiamat viewing herself as a woman wronged when her man was killed; and that all her subsequent plans are just rationalizations for her efforts to exact "justice" on those who wronged her and Apsu</p>

<p>-OK, so Anshar was displaced by Anu, his son<br />
Anu abdicated in place of Enlil<br />
Enlil abdicated in place of Marduk<br />
I could see Anshar being especially bitter as after being robbed of his position, he then saw it handed off because his usurper just didn't care about what was taken from Anshar</p>

<p>-Anu abdicated out of disinterest and serves as an advisor to Marduk. But did Marduk get the position from Enlil because Enlil and had no choice (due to the threat of destruction from Tiamat)? If so, would he feel cheated and want to take the title back?<br />
So Marduk has three godly advisors: one who is indifferent to mortals and most going-ons (Anu); one that might be tempted to arrange things so that he gets the throne back (Enlil); and Marduk's father (Enki) who cares deeply for humanity. An interesting divergence of opinions for Marduk if that is the case. <br />
If Enlil does want his position back, he may not be evil but he might be tempted to nudge things a certain way if they might result in him taking back the throne</p>

<p>-I like the depiction of Dahak as an imprisoned occupant of the Abyss who is just now managing to exert his influence. Gives the vibe of a new player entering the field of combat where the long-playing foes had an uneasy balance of power that will now tip one of several ways</p>

<p>-Also liked the concept of Asmodeus posing as Druaga. Could serve to throw additional monkey wrenches into things. E.g. would he secretly help Tiamat or even the good Mesopatamian gods to keep Dahak (and his probable demon-hordes) in check?</p>

<p>-"Nanna-Sin...a fickle yet good-natured deity, not caring much for the edicts of [the higher gods]...Still he is an unflinching foe of evil"<br />
Seems like one could have some fun with an anti-authority but ultimately good god stirring things up</p>

<p>-"Nergal &amp; Ereshkigal (Lesser and Intermadiate god, respectively): The gods of death, destruction and the underworld. They remained a neutral party during the war against Tiamat. They still maintain an adversarial relationship to the rest of the pantheon (Nergal particulary likes to antagonize Marduk)"<br />
I could see these two in the Grey Wastes using yugoloths to subtly manipulate the other players in the pantheon without exposing themselves</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Well, to be honest, I *am* taking quite a few "artistic liberties". I want to reach some kind of middle ground between Classical Mythology and PS canon (which itself took quite a few liberties regarding mythology)</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>

</div></p>

<p>Yes, that's pretty much what I'm going for. I've also got the idea for a category of "beigns", not really gods, but of "Elder beigns" or "Old ones" who precceded the current gods. Apsu and Uranus (and perhaps Tharizdun and others) would be of this order. Perhaps they could be part of the Ancient Brethren, or somethin on the same level.</p>

</div></p>

<p>From what I got from both mythology and Pantheons of the Megaverse, that was essentially Tiamat's schtick. Apsu wanted to kill off their children because they were "too noisy", Tiamat objected and asked Apsu to wait (Mythology is a bit blurry on her motives, presumably it could be due to Maternal instincts, like Gaea, but Pantheons of the Megaverse presents the idea that Tiamat just thought their children could still be useful pawns), but Enki struck before both her and Apsu were prepared. The loss of her consort was what presumably drove her into a murderous rage, though Pantheons of the Megaverse, again, states she is not in a hurry to free Apsu, since she would be "just" his consort, while apparently she has grown to have her owm motives and ambitions. She could still want "justice" upon those who wronged her though.</p>

<p>Yeah, I got the idea from Rip's earlier piece about Anshar ^^</p>

</div></p>

<p>You know, that's a pretty good idea. To be fair, Marduk was a Babylonian construct to justify the ascendancy and prominence of Babylon. In Assyrian myth, it was Anshar who performed all the deed Marduk is credited for (the Assyrians identified Anshar with their patron god, Assur), and it's likely that the original Sumerian copies of the Enuma Elish featured Enlil doing the same deeds (it's hard to know for sure though, since no Sumerian copies of the Enuma Elish subsist to this day).<br />
According to myth, it was Enki who masterminded the birth of Marduk in order to face Tiamat, and he supported his bid for Rulership. He demanded to be made King of the Gods if he fought off Tiamat and her hordes (Since neither Anu nor Enlil were able to). After he finished cleaning house, he returned the Tablets of Destiny to Anu, who honored their agreement and confirmed him as King of the gods (here's a pretty handy and tl;dr version: <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnumaElish" title="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnumaElish">http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnumaElish</a>)<br />
That said, a case can be maid to Enlil sublty trying to manipulate happenings to benefit him, though It would be hard to do going against someone with the Tablets of Destiny (which grant him limited omniscience and precognition) backed by one of the wiliest Powers in existance and the former King (who backs him out of a sense of adherence to law).</p>

<p>Thanks! I got the idea from the Dungeon issue featuring the Wells ofDarkness, which mentions him beign trapped inside. Since Dahak was originally a figure of Zoroastrian myth,I looked for some way to connect him to the Mesopotamians. Kingu/Qingu fit the bill pretty well IMO. The last part was an idea to keep him an active, if subtle, player.</p>

-Also liked the concept of Asmodeus posing as Druaga. Could serve to throw additional monkey wrenches into things. E.g. would he secretly help Tiamat or even the good Mesopatamian gods to keep Dahak (and his probable demon-hordes) in check?
</div></p>

<p>Could be. Then again he really wants to avoid attracting addiotional attention, especially from the enemies of his Asmodeus persona, so he needs to be extra-subtle. He would likely be playing all sides against each other, though the Baatezu alliance with Tiamat could come into play heavily. </p>

Seems like one could have some fun with an anti-authority but ultimately good god stirring things up
</div></p>

<p>I wrote that referencing his CG alignment from L&amp;L and OHG. Somewhere I also read he didn't care much for Enlil's decrees, something which I figure hasn't changed at all with Marduk.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>
-"Nergal &amp; Ereshkigal (Lesser and Intermadiate god, respectively): The gods of death, destruction and the underworld. They remained a neutral party during the war against Tiamat. They still maintain an adversarial relationship to the rest of the pantheon (Nergal particulary likes to antagonize Marduk)"
I could see these two in the Grey Wastes using yugoloths to subtly manipulate the other players in the pantheon without exposing themselves</div></p>

<p>Quite possibly, since by canon Nergal's realm is in the Gray Waste, while by myth Ereshkigal shares court with Nergal (Thouh it's pretty clear Ereshkigal is the one in charge). In a related note, I'm considering changing the Realm name (Nergaltos) to the name of the Mesopotamian underworld (Kur), similar to other "Netherworld" powers (like Hel, Hades and Mictantecuhtli)</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

          Re: The Mesopotamian Pantheon         </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>In real life, Druaga was another name for Ahriman, the Zoroastrian god of evil. For some reason, he's included among the Babylonian gods in AD&amp;D, so I had to make up some myths to make it work. Anyway, this was them. No, it's not perfectly "accurate," and I suppose I should apologize in advance to any devout worshippers of the Babylonian or Zoroastrian pantheons. Also, I found myself using "demon," "fiend," and "devil" interchangeably -- the words refer to spirits of all sorts, but include both baatezu and Ancient Baatorians.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Worlds</span></p>

<p>There are many worlds in the cosmos other than the mortal world we call home. The upper worlds number seven, and they are the home of the planetary gods. Paralleling them are seven worlds of the dead, ruled by Ereshkigal. Nearby, as such distances go, is a home of fiends called the Devil World.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Tiamat</span></p>

<p>The mother of everything is called Tiamat. Tiamat was originally the unformed abyss, but she gained shape and personality when her children named her.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">The first war.</span></p>

<p>Encouraged by her wicked son Mummu, Tiamat and her consort Apsu warred against her children. She spawned numerous fiends to defeat them, but one child learned to fight back.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Ea</span></p>

<p>Ea was the first wizard, both man and fish, both dragon and god. Ea was the one who discovered the power behind names. He used names to bind demons to aid his family against the Mother's hordes. He taught them to obey his charms. The fiends, bound to obey Ea's will, were kept in a city that would later become the Devil World. Eventually, in what would be an early turning point in the war, Ea bound Mummu in an eternal prison and managed to kill Apsu, forcing Tiamat to spawn a replacement, Kingu.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Marduk</span></p>

<p>All of Ea's wit was not enough to defeat the forces of Tiamat. Ea trained a student, Marduk, to bind demons as well. Ea trained Marduk to be stronger, faster, and more magically adept every day, until the apprentice at last surpassed his master. Harder Ea forced Marduk to train, until at last he thought him ready. Gathering demons from the air and sky, Marduk went to war with a horde greater even than the Mother's. Though the battle lasted long, ultimately Tiamat was defeated and half her soul was bound and made into a gate to the Devil World.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">The expansion of the Devil World.</span></p>

<p>Ea created humanity from the blood of Kingu and bound them by their names to support the gods with prayers, sacrifices, and invocations of their own. He taught them to harness the soil to create food, how to weave words to create meaning, how to use the sun to force mud to become bricks, how to force bricks to become cities, and how to bind minor demons to help, heal, protect and stay away.</p>

<p>As the newly created mortal world grew, so did the world of fiends. Great rivers spread across both, and between them were cities.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">The Binder Prince</span></p>

<p>In the mortal world, a child was born to a priest-king fabled for his skill at demon-binding. Fiends served in his court in every position, from common laborer to cook to chief advisor, all bound to the ruler's whim. The child appeared normal in every way, but when he was first seen by the demon-midwife she immediately knew he was special. 'My lord,' she cried, and threw herself on the floor before the babe. The priest-king was pleased.</p>

<p>As the child grew, it was clear his skill at binding had surpassed his father's peak by his first year, and it only became greater. With his infant son strapped to his back, the priest-king united the cities of the mortal world, sending his enemies to fill the newly opened worlds of the dead. The old man died when his son had only seen eight inundations of the plains, but there was no doubt the young successor would be able to keep his father's holdings and expand on them.</p>

<p>This he did. By the time he was twelve, the young Binder already had set his sights on another challenge: conquering the worlds of the gods themselves.</p>

<p>At puberty the boy began to transform, his body becoming a mess of tentacles and his arms quadrupling in number. Still the legions of fiends under his control swelled with new recruits. When he felt he had twice as many demons under his command as the gods, he launched his attack.</p>

<p>Devils flew to the homes of the gods, striking the worlds controlled by Sin, Nebo, Ishtar, Shammash, and Nergal. They kept coming until finally Ea discovered how to arrange a defense. He reconfigured the constellations into a ward of protection, twelve signs circling the homes of the gods. The warlord's assault stopped still, close enough for Ea to look into his soul and read his name there.</p>

<p>As he had suspected, the warlord wasn't human. Within the soul of the human prince had been hidden a dark seed that had the unmistakable shape of a first-generation spawn of Tiamat. The seed's name was Druaga. The young prince's soul had fallen into the worlds of the dead at the time of his body's transformation.</p>

<p>With Marduk's help, Ea had the creature killed.</p>

<p>Back on the mortal world, another human prince screamed as Druaga awakened in the nether part of his psyche, destroying it. The change came early, but this time Druaga led his minions in a different direction, to heart the Devil World.</p>

<p>The Devil World was no longer in the hands of Ea and Marduk; the gods turned to spirits elsewhere for aid. Because he had been cast from the heavens, Druaga named his palace The Retreat of the Fallen. Still he plotted revenge.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, he hid his soul in the body of another young prince.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">An alliance.</span></p>

<p>The free half of Tiamat's soul still wandered, spawning fresh young and gathering allies. A scorpion-man came to Druaga's Retreat as an emissary to the goddess, asking for aid. The King of the Devil World agreed.</p>

<p>The night before the joint attack, Tiamat herself drew her son into her coils, sucking at his tentacles with her many mouths. Druaga groaned in pleasure. Tiamat pulled her son in tighter, opening her womb, which Druaga entered into bodily, swimming through the primal waters within.</p>

<p>Then came a sharp twinge, a sense of panic as Druaga realized what was happening.</p>

<p>"My dear child," whispered Tiamat. "Now that you've brought me enough children to win, I have to draw you back into myself. I'm sorry, but it's the only sacrifice that will bring my Apsu back."</p>

<p>With mounting horror Druaga realized what she wanted, what she had always wanted. Her succession of consorts, her raging against the gods, they were all a result of her anguish over the death of her ancient lover and complement. "No, mother!" Druaga cried. "You still need me to command my hordes! Mother, please!"</p>

<p>In his mother's womb, he shivered as it grew increasingly certain that Tiamat could steal his soul, even hidden as it was. Wasn't it she who had secreted it originally into the body of an unborn princeling of the mortal world? "Don't worry, child," Tiamat assured him as the walls of her womb began to constrict like her serpentine coils. "Your knowledge won't go to waste. I have children who can catch the names in your head and keep them from slipping away. Tiny children writing a new Tablet of Destiny for their reborn lord." With that thought Druaga dissolved completely.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">A new alliance.</span></p>

<p>He awoke in watery darkness. He assumed he was still trapped inside his mother, but shortly realized that instead of the salt associated with Tiamat, the water was fresh. Then he recognized the body he was in as his last soul container, now an old man.</p>

<p>Druaga drifted in the water for some time, having difficulty seeing with his mortal eyes. He didn't know how long the skeleton had floated nearby before he noticed it.</p>

<p>Druaga blinked through the watery haze. The bones were vast and serpentlike, covered in millennia worth of vegetation and debris. The skull, however, was carved elaborately into the shape of a throne. On the throne sat a greenish humanoid with bright fishy eyes and clever hands and mouth. Draconic fins and gills surrounded him.</p>

<p>"I bet you didn't expect to see me," the figure smiled.</p>

<p>"Ea!" Druaga cried, recognizing the figure at last.</p>

<p>"Knowing our ancestress as I do, I took the liberty of binding your soul and host body here. It was a real dickens to find."</p>

<p>Druaga stammered.</p>

<p>"How?" Ea asked helpfully. "I have connections, here and there. I try to keep a hand in the goings on of the mortal world. All of your hosts tend to be royalty, don't they? I don't know why you bother. You haven't tried to rule a mortal state in eons."</p>

<p>Druaga stammered some more.</p>

<p>"You should try it. I have avatars working as court magicians in several mortal states. It's dreadfully enlightening."</p>

<p>Druaga found his voice. "My responsibilities to my court, the promises I've made..." he burbled into the water.</p>

<p>"Look where your responsibilities have gotten you," Ea snapped. "I'll make this short: I've brought you here to make you a proposition. You've already seen what your mother has to offer. Work with me instead. Provide some of your devil hordes for the celestial gods to use on occasion. Become part of the new multiversal order. In return, I don't extinguish your soul right now."</p>

<p>"You're very persuasive," said Druaga through a cloud of bubbles.</p>

<p>"Of course I am," returned Ea. "That's my job. You're good at it too, within your sphere. Administration, personnel, manipulation, bindings. You take after your old man."</p>

<p>Druaga went back to stammering.</p>

<p>"You didn't think Tiamat gave birth to you through parthenogenesis, did you? That's not her style. She always has to have a consort: Apsu, Mummu, Kingu, those five color-coded dragons. I'm one of them, of course -- I'm the green dragon paragon, the one she calls Bakidu. She's always trying to fill the void left when I killed this fellow here." Ea rapped on his throne, which of course was carved into Apsu's skeleton. "So what is it, son? Do we have a deal, or do I write you on the dead-tablet too?"</p>

<p>Druaga eyed the dead god, so like his mother. "I believe we have a deal."</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Sure. I think any of the non-prominent panthenons (i.e. any beside the Greek and Norse) are worth more of a spotlight. <br />
While this is not based on the established mythic lore, one aspect of the standard DnD lore that I always thought would have been interesting to explore is the tie between the githyanki and red dragons under Tiamat. To me the idea of the githyanki assisting Tiamat's dragons in their missions to weaken the rest of the the Mesopotamean pantheon and their followers as a form of repayment for the service the red dragons give to the githyanki. Perhaps other worlds with Babylonian cultures have legends of gaunt figures that arrived from nowhere upon the backs of the dragons to raze their ziggaraths to the ground</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>This is not a weak effort. Pantheons with a historical basis need revitalization (like Scion or Hackmaster).</p>

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>To start the ball rolling, I have a question.</p>

<p>Why does no one seem to disagree with the idea that <strong>Anshar/Ashur </strong>degenerates into a bitter or evil god? In my opinion, I simply see him and <strong>Kishar</strong> splitting the scene long ago.</p>

<p>Why not? They could find some primitive tribal people in other lands and easily become Father Sky and Mother Earth to them. I also envision this duo being able to persuade a few others to join them!</p>

<p>New Pantheon:</p>

<ul><li>Anshar (Ashur, Arusar)</li>

<p><li>Kishar (Kishara, Ki)</li></p>

<p><li>Ishkur</li></p>

<p><li>Ishum (Hendursanga)</li></p>

<p><li>Ninsar</li></p>

<p><li>Ninkurra (Ninkur)</li></ul></p>

<p><span style="color:darkblue"><strong>Ishkur </strong></p>

<p>God appointed to be in charge of the winds by Enki. He is in charge of "the silver lock of the 'heart' of heaven". When Enki distributed the destinies, he also made Ishkur inspector of the cosmos. <br />
The Sumerian Ishkur appears in the list of gods but was of far less importance than the Akkadian Adad, his counterpart, later became, probably partly because storms and rain are scarce in Sumerian lands and agriculture there depends on irrigation instead. Also, the gods Enlil and Ninurta also had storm god features which decreased Ishkur's distinctiveness.</p>

<p>If Anshar promised Ishkur an opportunity to be the only storm god in a pantheon, I think Ishkur would accept.</span></p>

<p><em>Gibil:
He is the Sumerian god of fire, Anatum's son. </p>

<p>Gerra (Gibil) Girra<br />
He is the Babylonian god of fire, Anunitu (Antu)'s son. </p>

<p>Ishum (Hendursanga - 'lofty mace') <br />
He is the Babylonian god of fire, and is adept at using weapons. </p>

<p>Nusku <br />
He is the Babylonian god of fire and Ellil's vizier. A lamp is his attribute.</p>

<p>Nusku was the name of the light and fire-god in Babylonia and Assyria, who is hardly to be distinguished, from a certain time on, from a god Girru - formerly read Gibil. Nusku-Girru is the symbol of the heavenly as well as of the terrestrial fire. </em></p>

<p><strong>Ishum </strong>seems to be to be the odd man out here. Since the Babylonian pantheon already has another (more popular) fire god, Ishum would probably be open to other opportunities. As Ashur, Anshar was a divinity of Sky and War could offer the position of god of fire and warriors to Ishum.</p>

<p><span style="color:darkgreen">Since Ninsar and Ninkurra are obscure goddesses, I will relate their myth:</p>

<p><em>Enki had a penchant for beer and a string of incestuous affairs. In the epic Enki and Ninhursag, he and his consort Ninhursag had a daughter Ninsar. When Ninhursag left him he came upon and then had intercourse with Ninsar (Lady Greenery) who gave birth to Ninkur or Ninkurra / Nindurra (Lady Fruitfulness or Lady Pasture). A second time, he had intercourse with Ninkurra, who gave birth to Uttu, the spider, the one who maintains interconnectedness of all with all. (Wikipedia)</em></p>

<p>I find this myth distasteful but I see potential in <strong>Ninsar</strong> and <strong>Ninkurra</strong>. I see them taking aspects from both ancestors' portfolios.</p>

<p>I envision <strong>Ninsar</strong> (from Nin = Lady or Queen, Sar = Green(ery)) as the goddess of agriculture (which involves freshwater, soil and plants). Maybe she could become the goddess of animal husbandry as well.</p>

<p>For <strong>Ninkur/Ninkurra</strong> (from Nin = Lady or Queen, Kur = underground freshwater ocean), I see her as becoming a goddess of freshwater plants and, by extension, freshwater animals. As her worship grows, she would eventually become the goddess of freshwater lakes and rivers. </p>

<p>If approached by Kishar, I don't see either of them having a problem leaving the Sumerian pantheon. </span></p>

<p>Maybe some more refugees from the Vedic pantheon (like Druaga) may wish to join also. Any suggestions?</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p><span style="font-style:italic"><span style="font-family:arialnarrow">Enki </p>

<p>Enki is the son of Nammu, the primeval sea. Contrary to the translation of his name, Enki is not the lord of the earth, but of the abzu (the watery abyss and also semen) and of wisdom. He maybe was once known as <span style="font-weight:bold">En-kur</span>, lord of the underworld, which either contained or was contained in the Abzu.</p>

<p>The abzu ( Akkadian: apsû ) from the Sumerian ab 'ocean' and zu 'wisdom' or 'deep' was the name for fresh water from underground aquifers that was given a religious quality in Sumerian and Akkadian mythology. Lakes, springs, rivers, wells, and other sources of fresh water were thought to draw their water from the abzu.</span></span></p>

<p>Palomides,</p>

<p>This is a good interpretation. Kishar is alreadly the earth goddess; Ninkur would have freshwater in her portfolio as daughter/granddaughter of Enki. <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/barf.gif" title="Barf!" alt="Barf!" class="smiley-content"/></p>

<p>I needed a water goddess; although Ninsar and Ninkur could switch roles.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><span style="font-weight:bold"><span style="font-size:14px">Lahmu &amp; Lahamu (the Lahama) </span></span><br />
<span style="font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">The Firstborn </span></span><br />
(with many thanks to Ripvanwormer!)<br />
<span style="color:midnightblue"><br />
The children of Tiamat and Apsu, <span style="font-weight:bold">Lahmu and Lahamu</span> are strange, serpentine progenitors of all the gods of the Igigi. Older than Ge and Ouranos and almost unimaginably ancient in one of the eldest assemblages of deities known, they were the first to exist in their pantheon.</p>

<p>Although they were allies of their descendents Marduk and Ea during the war against their  primordial parents, they felt they had little place in the new order the gods created. They bowed gracefully out and slithered away to a temple on Arborea to guard ancient secrets. Soon out of sight, they were also out of mind; exactly as they  were designed to be. </p>

<p>Somewhere secure, they embraced a final time and slipped gently in unconsciousness; they awoke, not as Lahmu and Lahamu, but as Apsu and Tiamat. Although greatly diminished, these powers of water and chaos were very much alive by their own design. Lahmu and Lahamu were not children of Apsu and Tiamat but the <span style="font-weight:bold">first avatars</span>. More correctly, they were the <span style="font-style:italic">first</span> <span style="text-decoration:underline">contingency plan</span> should both their creators perish. </p>

<p>An imaginative plan by the primeval duo but, perhaps, also a self-fulfilling prophecy; it was Lahmu and Lahamu’s more orderly natures (in comparison to their creators) that introduced order and it’s importance to Igigi from the beginning. Lahmu and Lahamu always thought they were the progenitors of some of the oldest divinities known but, truthfully, were merely the first babysitters. They were better parents than their creators could have been.</p>

<p>As is known, Tiamat assumed another identity in another pantheon on another world and, eventually, became a greater goddess before truth of her existence was revealed to the planes. The fate of Apsu is unknown. No purple dragon with five heads (orange, pink, purple, gray and yellow, <span style="font-style:italic">of course</span>) has ever been sighted. If Tiamat knows, she never speaks of it.</p>

<p>Of course, the fate of Lahmu and Lahamu is a source of  distress to the eldest of the Igigi. The Lahama will always be fondly remembered by their “children”. Ironically, Lahmu and Lahamu’s memories live on in Apsu and Tiamat respectively and causes the latter much consternation.<br />
