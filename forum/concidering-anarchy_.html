</div> <p>I'm sure it's not just me, as evident by the much less demonizing description they get in the 3E conversion, but the original Planescape books really don't seem very fond of the Revolutionary league. That's an understatement - they essentially paint the Anarchists as antisocial dropout terrorists with a pubertile hate and distrust towards everything and everyone.</p>

<p>Which, of course, is in keeping with the writers' tendency to always subtly favor the "law" factions as morally superior.</p>

<p>I admit Planescape neither is nor ever was the real world, but seeing as the Anarchists of Planescape seem to be made to actually represent Anarchists I'd like to make a few points about actual Anarchism and hopefully spark a little discussion.</p>

<p>First of all, it is highly debatable if it should have the chaotic focus in the metagame that it currently does. I seem to remember law representing order and not hierarchy, but in the Harmonium/Revolutionary league contrast it seems that law is first and foremost an expression of obedience and hierarchic duty.<br />
Anarchism, by its very nature, requires a great deal of order to work. As the saying goes - the amateur can handle order, but the master can handle chaos. When there are no leaders, the importance of order is hard to overstate. That being said, this order is different from the kind of order used in highly hierarchic communities, which brings us to my second point.</p>

<p>Anarchism, with very few exceptions, loves decentralization. For all their slogans, if there is anything most, if not all, Anarchists agree on, it's that power must be decentralized. When the state is dismantled and the laws made mute, order is restored by mutual agreements in local communities. What is illegal in one neighborhood might be common practice in the next, but there is nothing but public opinion and mutual respect for the order that keeps society functioning to enforce such agreements.</p>

<p>Which leads us to the small, decentralized units that make up the Revolutionary league.</p>

<p>Anyone who's ever read anything about the militant vandal and terrorist groups that exist in the real world know that the jibber jabber about them being unable to trust anyone is grabbed out of thin air. If anything, the people involved in such things trust each other far more than most friends do. They are often involved in things that would be extremely harmful for them if their identities were ever made public. These units are, more often than not, made up of people who have known each other for years, know each other like family and feel close enough to be certain that the disapproval of their friends would be enough for no one to ever rat anyone else out.</p>

<p>These aren't school shooting loners we're talking about.</p>

<p>And finally, for color, I would like to mention the real world tendency for activists of all fields to crossbreed their behavior and opinions, thus why many animal rights activists and environmentalists have taken on anarchist methods and rhetoric, and many anarchists, in turn, have adopted a great deal of the former's beliefs. <br />
Also worth mentioning is that a great deal (although not all) anarchists are far into the socialist camp, thus the fun concept of selfrighteous shoplifting. This, I would say, goes pretty well with the amount of thieves in Sigil, as well as the relative respect they enjoy.</p>

<p>Hope I put this in the right section.</p>

In practice, yes.  I could go on about how communism and libertarianism are incorrectly portrayed as well.  The problem is that all three political/social systems are based on pipe-dreams and/or misconceptions about basic human nature.  They also (usually) fail to make considerations about people who don't fit into any of their pre-defined groups or spheres.<br />
For instance, Libertarianism expects self-reliance and self-responsibility out of all of its citizens.  It fails to take into consideration the mentally ill, physically, and mentally disabled who are incapable of self-responsibility.  When pressured to find an aswer for these groups, Libertarians claim that the working folks will all be generous and give enough to charity to help all of these people, since they are no longer being taxed.<br />
Anarchy fails to take into consideration the conflicts of ideology and self-interest between individuals of the community; it functions under the erroneous assumption that there will be no strife, no grudges, etc.  and that it can prevent the collective from simply taking the law into their own hands individually.  It also does nothing to protect the black sheep from becoming the victim of unpopular opinion.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>But neither Communism nor Libertarianism has a faction dedicated to it, and in either case it seems like the Revolutionary league focuses quite heavily on the violent aspects of the anarchist ideology.</p>

<p>My point isn't that they should be hailed as some kind of moral high road - after all, most of the league seem to be terrorists, vandals and/or thieves - all I'm saying is that the official line accuses them of faults that are not uncommonly the strengths of anarchism.<br />
Especially so in the case of internal trust.</p>

<p>The Black Bloc may hate their rulers, but if anything that hate only seems to fuel their love of each other. Much like the claim that world peace would require an antagonist from space, their shared opposition to power binds them together rather than turns them into paranoid loners.</p>

<p>But getting back to the quoted passage - it seems to me as if you are arguing against the justness of their cause. What I'm trying to establish is common threads within the ideology, not whether or not it is superior to anything else.<br />
I'm arguing that there is a vision, not merely a horde of misfits that turn to terrorism out of stupidity. That, in my eyes, would merely make them a blander, more violent Xiaositects, and that's a terrible waste of potential.</p>

<p>edit:<br />
So as not to misinterpreted, I'd just like to repeat that I find the description in the 3E conversion less flat and biased. I would, however, like to nudge you into the direction of, if not else, removing their inability to trust each other. It just seems counterintuitive and terribly unrealistic to me.</p>

<p>I'm arguing human nature more than politics here.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Which, of course, is in keeping with the writers' tendency to always subtly favor the "law" factions as morally superior.</div></p>

<p>That's your reading? It certainly isn't mine, since the Harmonium was consistently portrayed as errant blowhard who made a huge mistake (and lost and entire planar <span style="font-style:italic">layer</span>) and the Mercykillers got ganked way harder than any other faction during the Faction War.</p>

<p>The Faction with the most real evidence for favoritism is the Ciphers, a faction with no enemies that got a complete pass on faction war and who faction weakness was written totally without mechanics (making it easy for creative players to dodge, and difficult for DMs to deal with without brutally curtailing the random insanity that makes gaming around a table so much fun).</p>

<p>I would add that in makes a great deal of practical sense to portray the Revolutionary League in a poor light because as they were initially written up they were unplayable in most gaming groups because they required one member of the party to hold an agenda different from the rest and hide behind a mask. This goes totally counter to the 'band of heroes' nature of D&amp;D where even evil parties tend to work with a relatively high degree of cohesion (this doesn't have to be the case of course, but D&amp;D was not designed to handle party backstabbing and in-fighting, an is vastly inferior to something like Vampire for handling that type of experience).</p>

<p>As for the internal distrust issue, it is very important to remember that unlike real-world anti-establishment groups, the Revolutionary league is opposed to effectively <span style="font-style:italic">all aspects</span> of the existing order. They don't have any sort of semi-unified vision of what the world would look like when their cause is accomplished, and as a result are extremely suspicious of other cells of their faction attempting to impose a kind of order they disagree with upon the multiverse, or for the even more likely threat of corruption in the ranks. Individual Revolutionary League 'cells' may have a good deal of internal unity, but the faction as a whole represents a vast kaleidoscope of differing visions that will conflict more often than not (real-world revolutionary groups conflict all the time).</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>You'll have to forgive the late reply, as I haven't got a stable connection to the internet.</p>

<p>As for my impression of subtle moral favoritism, I shan't go into detail on my reading of the 2E material, but I'll try and explain myself in broad strokes.</p>

<p>Admittedly the Harmonium is described as a faction of many enemies and a tendency to be the ones making them, a caricature of the modern police force.<br />
The Mercykillers, on the other hand, are described (in the Factol's Manifesto) as so dedicated to justice as to rarely if ever punish a wrongdoing before going through the proper channels (arrested by the Harmonium, declared guilty by the Fraternity of Order, judged by the Mercykillers) and for being much more obsessed about the flawless proof of guilt than the actual punishment. If I remember correctly, their Factol reads each prisoner's file closely enough to frequently correct errors by the Guv'ners, much to the annoyance of the obviously much less perfectionistic Fraternity of Order.<br />
Their chief virtue seems to be impartiality, which they see as a prerequisite for serving justice. Their religious overtones aside, they're portrayed as much more sympathetic than the Harmonium. I fail to see how their split during the war ever affects their moral claims.<br />
And as for the Fraternity, they're portrayed as an intellectual elite in charge of judging conflicts, but it seems very clear (from the claim that those looking for power rarely get far) this is meant as a manner of spiritual pursuit - knowledge for its own sake, pleasure in the beauty of systems and formulae. To all but the anti-intellectual and the haters of their societal function, this all looks pretty harmless.</p>

<p>But let's put this in contrast to the chaos factions. The Doomguard seems to fill (along with the Fated) a sort of badguy faction grab bag role, due to decentralized cells that run around creating trouble for the sake of it at the ground level and the endless promotion of large scale conflict and war at higher levels.<br />
They are often romantic to a fault, appreciating decay for its own sake, and frequently seem obsessed with bringing about the apocalypse.<br />
As for the Xiaositects, they lack anything resembling direction, but from what you see of them one presumes the general public views them as a horde of criminals, performance artists, madmen and hippies. They embody the ideals of direct action, but it seems to be direct action for its own sake rather than personal empowerment. They are the kind of people who would one day paint roosters on your windows, second day join a riot for the experience, third day run around chasing the sash around their waist and only speak through barks.<br />
Then there's the Revolutionary League.</p>

<p>And thus back to my original points:</p>

<p>First of all, as you say, it is hard to imagine a D&amp;D party where everyone pulls in a completely different direction getting anything significant done, which is precisely why I'm trying to drive the point about internal distrust.<br />
The Anarchist unit, in real life as it should be in Planescape, is actually fairly close to the average adventuring party. It usually consists of members drawn together because of common goals and similar interests, often differing greatly from other units and not necessarily always getting along within their own. It is the group of friends gone gang with flat hierarchy and moralist overtones. Even within a non-Anarchist party, the Anarchist shouldn't need to hide what he is any more than any other faction-member, since adventuring parties rarely are any use to try and infiltrate.</p>

<p>And secondly, I believe it to be counter-intuitive and most certainly against the general atmosphere of the Planescape setting for there to be a group of "philosophers with clubs" whose only belief seems to be that they don't like the Harmonium very much.<br />
Admittedly there is more to the "establishment" of Sigil, but that is what it often amounts to. As I've already said, it makes any and all members of the League look like pubertile idiots, and it implies an utter incapability to argue, which I believe hurts the setting. How are you supposed to debate a group which has no beliefs of their own and how does that tie in with the idea of belief changing the world?<br />
They are not the Free League - they should have something that unifies them beyond unwillingness to join other factions - they are not the Doomguard - so they should have other goals than destruction - and they are not the Xiaositects - so they should have some manner of focus or direction, however decentralized it may be.</p>

<p>If the closest to a unified vision is a society without a unified vision so much as a process of agreements between individuals and direct democracy (as opposed to, say, the leninist idea of an educated elite governing until the people is ready, effectively establishing a new establishment), that is still a vision and it makes them infinitely less bland and more believable than the "terrorists without a cause" they are often portrayed as.</p>

<p>And finally, I would just like to point out that Githzerai society on Limbo as described in the original setting occasionally sounds like textbook anarchism, possibly discounting the politically powerless but very influential Godking. The whole thing looks kind of like ancient Greece, but without the slaves, and thus not like ancient Greece at all.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Alisohn Nilesia, the Mercykiller factol, is also 100% insane.  She thinks that her ultimate goal in life is to find what the Lady of Pain is guilty of and punish her for it, and instituted sentencing "reforms" the entirety of which are comprised of "10 years for misdemeanors, death for felonies".  There's also a strong hinting (even outright admitted in the Manifesto in certain specific cases) that Nilesia assassinated basically everyone that would be in her way of becoming factol, including her own foster mother, the former factol, and an entire swath of Mercykiller veterans that were unsure about her ascent</p>

<p>As for the faction itself, Arwyl Swan's Son is certainly characterized as you've described the faction as are his followers, but he's just one force.  There's a huge group within the faction that is completely opposed to even the concept of extenuating circumstances, of which Nilesia is the biggest example.  The division between the Sons of Mercy and the Sodkillers was still existent to some degree even before Faction War, if unofficially, and they certainly weren't all the paragon of moral role models that you've characterized them as.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>And Arwyl is portrayed as being hopelessly idealistic, he has more or less all the best points of a high-level Prime paladin and all the worst points of a high-level Prime paladin (he's one of the most stereotypical characters in the entirety of Planescape).</p>

<p>And the faction war split kills the Lawful Neutral proportion of the Mercykillers who actually believe in the utterly harsh impartiality of Justice, which was, to me, what made them interesting, replacing them with what is basically an order of Paladins (Sons of Mercy) and an order of brutal mercenaries (the Sodkillers) neither of which have the uniqueness of Planescape factions.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Admittedly there is more to the "establishment" of Sigil, but that is what it often amounts to. </div></p>

<p>You're making the classic mistake of conflating 'what happens in Sigil' with 'what happens on the Planes as a whole.' Yes, rebelling against the highly fractious and certifiably insane government of Sigil (which is run by the Signers after all) does seem kind of pointless (especially considering the general impossibility of defying the Lady).</p>

<p>On the greater Planes there are several forms of 'establishment' that could very easily be considered an opponent on a cosmic scale: the collusion of the Powers, the collusion of the Arch-exemplars, the maintenance of an eternal status-quo by the Rilmani (and their allies), the tyranny of a cosmic order that forces all mortals to eventually subsume their consciousness into something else, and I could go on. That's not even specifying any of the specifically 'lawful' forces of the multiverse.</p>

<p>The Revolutionary League is not a group of 'terrorists without a cause' they are 'terrorists with ten thousand causes' many of which happen to be mutually exclusive. They were designed as a chaotic faction and revolution is a chaotic bent and so they inherently would not be a unified group.</p>

<p>Also, don't try and make the Revolutionary League into something they're not. The goals of a self-governing society of automatically agreeing individuals already belongs to another faction: The Transcendent Order.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>I'm not sure why you think the anarchists are opposed only to the Harmonium, nor do I understand the critique that you think the anarchists have no goals other than disestablishment. </p>

<p>In the first case, it is made pretty clear that the Anarchists have cells in every faction. At one point, they even assassinated many of the faction heads within a short space of time. Their unifying goal is to overthrow the existing establishment. Naturally, as is the nature of revolutionary groups, not everyone agrees about what to do afterwords. The fact that they don't necessarily all agree doesn't mean they don't still have other goals. The point is, their central theme is to topple established authority because of a central belief that authority and power is corrupting and abusive. Naturally they are more opposed to factions like the Harmonium, simply because the Harmonium is the faction that polices Sigil. It follows that they would therefore be the faction that has the most interest in actively interfering with the Anarchists, and vice versa. </p>

<p>I think part of your discomfort with the Planescape portrayal of Anarchists seems to be based on the fact that you have a distinctly modern view of the anarchist movement. Modern anarchism, while still generally agreeing on the disestablishment line, has evolved into a sort of catch all for militant activism. Some guys have developed particular philosophies of anarchism such as John Zirzan and his primitivist views. Others are generally pro-environment. Others are more into ideas of "self organizing societies" and so forth. </p>

<p>The thing is, these modern anarchists have little in common with the roots of anarchism as a movement in the 19th century. 19th century anarchism is very much like the anarchism portrayed in Planescape. They were terribly violent, extremely paranoid (with good reason), frequently engaged in assassination, had no real unified vision or power struggle, and really were only unified in so far as they used any means necessary to overthrow existing governments. When it came to the details of the "aftermath" their wasn't the slightest bit of coherence between one group or the next, or than perhaps some vague "progressive" vision (a vision that often as not would probably be laughed at by modern day anarchists). This anarchism was largely a response to the rapid changes brought on but industrialism, the vast gulf growing between rich and poor and specific political grievances usually in repressive tyrannical governments. Sometimes it was a rebellion against all three such as Czarist Russia or Hapsburg Austro-Hungary. There was an existential crisis in Europe brought on by the industrial revolution, and some people turned to Anarchism as a way to fight those changes.</p>

<p>In these anarchist cells, intragroup murder wasn't that infrequent, the risk of capture by authorities was great, and the consequences of such capture was almost certain death. The stakes were high, and the abuses being fought against were an in-your-face kind of inhumanity. The anarchists of that time have little in common with the much more pacified anarchists of today. Similarly the abuses of today just don't have the same visceral impact of the conditions of the 19th century. You may argue that the issues are more important today, but the fact is the suffering in, say, 19th century Russia was something that was human in nature, was readily apparent to everyone, was present nearly all the time, and was on such a massive scale that it wasn't really a matter of debate and uncertainty as with modern issues so much as it was an issue of who held the power and who should pay.</p>

<p>A good novel on the issue, albeit one slanted against the anarchists is Dostoevsky's The Devils (or The Demons depending upon the translation). This is particularly insightful if you read The Notes From the underground first, written when Dostoevsky actually was in an anarchist circle. The views you get there are just worlds apart from modern anarchists. I sort of consider those two books to be a great source of inspiration for how to run anarchists in Planescape.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I think where in real life you may have anarchists/ terrorists who are against a particular government or type of government.  The Revolutionary League are against all forms of government.</p>

<p>They are very much short term thinkers.  How do we go about overthrowing the "government", depending on who you ask you may get several different answers. What about after "The Revolution" let's say you win then what?  Again you get many different answers some of them mutually exclusive.  Even though their headquarters is on an "evil" plane I can see part of their doctrine appealing to many different types of chaotic people.</p>

<p>Bastion of Lost Hope.  What a great name!  You are the last line of defense.  Otherwise "they" will win.</p>

<p>The paranoia comes from being infiltrated by Law Enforcement types (Harmonium and Mercykillers) .  Being turned in for reward.  Being used in power plays.  Being mistaken for Doom Guards.  There will be those in your cell who are just a few steps away from joining the Doom Guards, who approve of the methods.</p>

<p>It is not just destruction for destruction's sake neither is it blindly following the rules like the rest of the sheep out there.</p>

<p>It is getting "our" message across.  If we have to break a few eggs in the process so be it.  The alternative is to let "them" win.</p>

<p>If you have seen V for Vendetta it is kind of the feeling they are going for.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">
