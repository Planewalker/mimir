</div> <p>I went to one of the planewalker.com seminars at GenCon Indy this year and heard that conversion notes might be useful to you.  I made the following for an epic level quest I am running.  I am not sure how useful they would be since many people to not run epic campaigns but I thought I would post them just incase some one would find them useful.  I made this document in Word and it would probably look better that way, but I am not sure how to up load files to your site.</p>

<p>Conversion Notes for Tales of the Infinite Staircase by Monte Cook<br />
(A conversion sheet for encounters from the AD&amp;D 2nd edition quest to a 25th level D&amp;D 3.5 edition quest)</p>

<p>This quest was used as a spring board to get my PCs from around 25th level to 30th level so they would be able to face the perils of the Quicksilver Hourglass (an adventure for 30th level characters in Dungeon # 123).  I have not converted or made a substitution for every single encounter.  I am sure that countless errors abound in this document as well. Sometimes I have deviated from the standard quest by introducing new plot elements and at times I have cut out parts of the original quest to best fit my campaign.  By far the most time consuming job in converting a quest from one game mechanic to another is the creation of NPC blocks.  I have donated these conversion notes in the hopes that it will save others a little time.</p>

<p>Tale 1: Planewalkers (for 25th level characters)</p>

<p>Blue Mushroom Area</p>

<p>Award the PCs no experience if they kill Telleax (unless they are evil).</p>

<p>Chamber of Deep Magic (EL 23)</p>

<p>Years ago a powerful Myrmarch sorcerer used several wishs to create the Chamber of Deep Magic.  It allows the Formian’s symbol of leadership, a rod of Epic Rulership, to be recharged of all of its magic.  It is unclear how many times this will be possible but inspection with detect magic and other magic scrying spells reveals that the old magic is still holding strong.  It is possible that other magic items could be recharged using the Chamber but there would no doubt be unforeseen side effects.  The Formians would not knowingly allow their sacred shrine used in any other way for fear that the ancient Epic magic be damaged.<br />
	If Ghundarania succeeds in completing here eternal life ritual she will indeed become immortal but will destroy the Chamber of Deep Magic in the process.<br />
	Telleax is under instruction to let no non-Formian recharge any magical item with in the chamber.  He will attack any person who brandishes a magical wand, rod or anything that he believes is magical (so about anything “funny looking”).  He is very loyal to the Formians and fights to the death.  Fortunately, for the PCs, he is quite dumb and can easily be tricked.  Award the PCs experience for defeating Telleax if they manage to recharge the Epic Rod of Rulership without harming Telleax.</p>

<p>Creatures:  Ghundarania (disguised as the Formian Myrmarch Demansiq), 10 Formian Warrior Paragons, 3 Formian Myrmarch Paragons.</p>

<p>	The PCs had best use diplomacy to diffuse the situation or things could get messy.  Ghundarania has the support of the Formian colony and if the PCs do not have proof of her treachery they may find themselves sorely out matched.  If the PCs can find a way to reveal Ghundarania’s true intent with out blood shed award them experience for an EL 30 encounter.  If the PCs fail to foil Ghundarania this time and are driven out, but return later and uncover her, award them experience for defeating Ghundarania in combat.  Subtract experience equal to the experience normally gained for each Formian that they kill in the main hive after they have confronted Ghundarania.</p>

The Bat Staff has a number of powers:<br />
1.	The Bat Staff allows the user to cast speak with animals (bats only) at will. <br />
2.	The user can call forth a number of flitting black energy shapes that surround the user giving him total concealment (this is an illusion effect).<br />

In addition anyone who possesses both the Bat Staff and the Cloak of the Bat can use the Cloak of the Bat’s powers on not only himself but 3 additional companions.  Bat creatures who encounter the user are also always treated as initially having Friendly attitude.<br />
Moderate divination, conjuration, and illusion; CL 6; Craft Staff; see invisibility; Price 100,000 gp</p>

<p>New Magic Item:  Helm of the Insect<br />
A Helm of the Insect confers a +8 enhancement bonus to natural armor.  The wearer is also constantly under the effects of a spider climb spell.<br />
Strong transmutation and weak divination; CL 24; Price: 1,292,000 gp </p>

<p>Tale 3: Lord of Worms</p>

<p>The entire demiplane of Maelost is also always under the effects of hurricane type weather.  These weather conditions make flying impossible (and even spells that protect against weather are subject to a targeted Superb Dispelling effect every round (+40).  Luckily these sever conditions only affect those who attempt to pass above the ridge lines.  The weather conditions between the ridges are blustery (50% chance of flames being extinguished) and rainy (-4 to listen and spot checks as well as visibility of only 30 feet).</p>

<p>The Dark Dweller is in fact a advanced Half-Celestial Elder Treant (70 HD) who is quite powerful, very alien, and a great force of Good.  Long ago the Dark Dweller fought an epic battle against its greatest foe, the Taker of Life (a Genius Loci, ELH pg. 190).  Unable to defeat this timeless monstrosity, the Dark Dweller created a prison where the Taker of Life would be imprisoned for eternity.  Unfortunately the power to create the prison required great sacrifice and the Dark Dweller was forced to become part of the demiplane.  In ages past the Hanim discovered the demiplane floating in the Ethereal.  Fleeing a now long forgotten enemy they settled here despite the harsh environment.   </p>

<p>Black Water (EL 26)</p>

<p>Taker of Life Water Creations:  Shadow of the Void (ELH pg. 214)<br />
Instead of being mere water creations, the Water Creations are created from the Taker of Life’s drowned victims and its evil malice.</p>

<p>One of these creatures attacks as soon as some one gets near the pool of water near the portal cave mouth.</p>

<p>Creature:  Shadow of the Void</p>

<p>Spot check DC 35 to notice the tunnels.</p>

<p>The Dark Dweller’s tentacles have the following statistics:<br />
Colossal outsider (good, plant)<br />
Each tentacle has 50 hp<br />
Base Attack/Grapple: +52/+81<br />
Attack:  +67 melee touch (no damage) or 2 slams +65 melee (10d6+21)<br />
Special Attacks: Improved grab (just has to hit with a touch attack), daylight at will, smite evil 1/day (+20 damage), triple damage against objects, spell-like abilities (pg. 223 of ELH and pg. 124 of MM)<br />
Special Qualities: plant traits, half damage from physical attacks, resistance to acid, cold, electricity 10, DR 22/- <br />
See the end of the Tale for the Dark Dweller’s freed statistics. </p>

<p>PCs must succeed at a DC 47 Will save to prevent the Dark Dweller from learning their alignment, outlook, and current goals (the DC is charisma based).</p>

<p>The Dark Dweller is fused to the back of an enormous cavern some 500 ft. below the surface of Maelost.  The Elder Treant is a mournful sight.  He has lost all of his once golden leaves and is now half petrified.  In place of its mobility it has grown many large roots that extend throughout the entire demiplane.  If the PCs can defeat the Taker of Life the Dark Dweller will be freed and returned to his former glory.  He could be a powerful alley if the PCs decide to take an Zophial (see below).</p>

<p>Treat the Scouring as a mass heal effect (it can cure even more effects at the DMs option).</p>

<p>The Dark Dweller also requests that the PCs destroy the Taker of Life.  He can transport the PCs to the Taker of Life’s prison at anytime they wish to face him.</p>

<p>The Taker of Life’s Prison (EL 30 something)</p>

<p>The Taker of Life is magically bound to a large cavern in the depths of Maelost.  It has recently dominated Zophial (see below).  Despite the Taker of Life’s lack of intelligence it does imprint the on its dominated creature the desire to free it at all costs.</p>

<p>Creatures:  Genius Loci</p>

<p>The People of Maelost</p>

<p>The Hanim are infact long displaced humas from the world of Athas.  Most of these Athasian humans have +2 to strength and constitution.</p>

<p>Hanim torag poles are exotic quarterstaffs made of bone that can be extended from 5ft. to 10ft. as a move equivalent action.  Torag Poles are exotic weapons but are in all other ways the same as a normal quarterstaff.</p>

<p>The Worm Lord (EL 32)</p>

<p>Unknown to the rest of his village Zophial has tapped into the power of the Taker of Life.  Zophial is a powerful spellcaster (use the statistics for Kyuss on pg. 84 of Dungeon Magazine # 135).  Zophial plans to use the divine energy to become the unchallenged ruler and deity of Maelost.  He is not quite powerful enough to attain godhood but as soon as he conquers a few more tribes and subjects them to his will he will be ready.  If the PCs attack him now he is able to assume his deity form for a limited amount of time (about 2 minutes).  This may be a serious problem for the PCs if they attack him because he is quite powerful.  On the bright side Zophials premature transformation kills him after he expends his divine energies.  The PCs must stand against him until he either falls by their hand or his time runs out.  If they run away Zophial takes out his frustration on the Hanim killing most of the people of Aml.</p>

<p>To prove the PCs worth Zophial sends them into the wilds of Maelost to kill the Death Kiss Beholder Abomination.  If the PCs are successful Zophial will not attack them (yet).  This great accomplishment also earns the PCs the respect of the Aml tribe.  Beating the abomination makes the people of Aml less worshipful of Zophial and will take away his divine rank).</p>

<p>If the PCs leave Maelost and come back at some later date they will find that Zophial now rains supreme over the demiplane.  If the PCs wish to destroy Zophial now, they will have to face not only the new born god but the freed Genius Loci as well (if they did not already destoy it).  Luckily the Dark Dweller still hides on the demiplane and will be more than happy to aid the PCs in their fight against Zophial.</p>

<p>If the PCs can destroy Zophial with out the loss of Hanim life award them experience for a CR 32 encounter.  If the PCs allow Zophial to kill off the occupants of Aml only award them for a CR 30 encounter.</p>

<p>Adventure Notes (EL 28)</p>

<p>The PCs encounter the formian queen Hvix’mnac floating in the endless void.  As soon as the PCs arrive the queen is attacked by a gang of Slaadi intent on revenge for being infected with the Iron Shadow.  The gang consists of 3 black slaadi.<br />
Conversion notes:  DR 15/epic and lawful, Add: Blinding Speed and Epic Toughness, hp 556, sonic immunity, resistance to acid, cold, fire, electricity 10 <br />
The queen is still muddled from the Iron Shadow and it will take a restoration spell to free her from it (it is possible to free her because she is not in an infected area any more).  The queen immediately senses the presence of the Mantelavian staff and can therefore attempt to get the PCs to help her return home with it to reclaim her throne (of course this will probably have to wait).  When the PCs return to Klictrik they must face off with Ghundarania/Demansiq (see Tale 2).   </p>

<p>The githyanki recognize the heroes as the adventures who destroyed the Lich Queen.  They plead with the PCs to destroy the Hagunemnon (ELH 196) and Uvuudaum (ELH 224) who are invading their city.  They also ask them to try to seal the planar breech that the creatures are coming through (although they have no idea how this can be accomplished).  As the PCs talk to the Githyanki, a group consisting of a Hagunemnon and 2 Uvuudaum approach and attack.  The PCs will have to fend off the creatures to save the githyanki.<br />

<p>The key of dreams is an artifact that confers the following abilities on the wearer (it implants itself in the wearer’s forehead and does not take up an item slot):</p>

<p>•	+2 bonus to wisdom if wisdom is at or below 13, +1 bonus if wisdom is above 13<br />
•	+5 bonus on all knowledge checks<br />
•	Ability to create a door way to the Infinite Staircase 1/month, the doorway lasts for 5 rounds<br />
•	A one time true resurrection which activates immediately after the character dies<br />
•	It can not be removed the the wearer’s forehead by any means short of possible divine intervention or a powerful epic spell<br />
•	Can seal planar breaches (this has an experience component determined by the DM)</p>

<p>It will cost the PC 1000 xp to close the planar rift that is letting these creatures in from the Far Realms.  The act is no more difficult that getting within 300 ft. of the rift and concentrating on it.  However just as the rift closes one more thing slips through…</p>

After exploring the same places the PCs have gone (just at different times) he has concluded that the Kyton’s have captured Ojhalia.  He knows he is not powerful enough to defeat the Kyton’s and their allies alone and has been forced to wait.  Now he will join the PCs, if they will let him tag along, so that he can rescue Ojhalia.</p>

Treasure:  Amulet of Epic Charisma +10</p>

<p>Crush (Ex) This special attack allows Mavarothix to land on opponents as a standard action, using its whole body to crush them. Crush attacks are effective only against opponents of size Medium or smaller (though it can attempt normal overrun or grapple attacks against larger opponents). A crush attack affects as many creatures as can fit under the dragon's body. Creatures in the affected area must succeed on a Reflex save (DC 36) or be pinned, automatically taking bludgeoning damage during the next round unless the dragon moves off them. If the dragon chooses to maintain the pin, treat it as a normal grapple attack. Pinned opponents take damage from the crush each round if they don't escape.<br />
Tail Sweep (Ex) This special attack allows Mavarothix to sweep with its tail as a standard action. The sweep affects a half-circle with a radius of 30 feet, extending from an intersection on the edge of the dragon's space in any direction. Creatures within the swept area are affected if they size Small or smaller. Affected creatures can attempt Reflex saves to take half damage (DC 36).<br />
Breath Weapon (Su) Mavarothix's breath weapon is a line of acid 120 feet long that does 24d4 points of acid damage. Using a breath weapon is a standard action. Once a dragon breathes, it can't breathe again until 1d4 rounds later. A blast from a breath weapon always starts at any intersection adjacent to the dragon and extends in a direction of the dragon's choice. If the breath weapon deals damage, creatures caught in the area can attempt Reflex saves to take half damage (DC 36).<br />
Frightful Presence (Ex) Mavarothix can unsettle foes with his mere presence. The ability takes effect automatically whenever Mavarothix attacks, charges, or flies overhead. Creatures within a radius of 360 feet are subject to the effect if they have fewer than 34 HD. A potentially affected creature that succeeds on a Will save (DC 33) remains immune to that dragon's frightful presence for 24 hours. On a failure, creatures with 4 or less HD become panicked for 4d6 rounds and those with 5 or more HD become shaken for 4d6 rounds. Dragons ignore the frightful presence of other dragons.<br />
Water Breathing (Ex) A black dragon can breathe underwater indefinitely and can freely use its breath weapon, spells, and other abilities while submerged.<br />
Corrupt Water (Sp) Once per day Mavarothix can stagnate 10 cubic feet of water, making it become still, foul, and unable to support animal life. The ability spoils liquids containing water. Magic items (such as potions) and items in a creature's possession must succeed on a Will save (DC 33) or become fouled. This ability is the equivalent of a 1st-level spell with range 360 ft.</p>

<p>Treasure:  In addition to the treasure listed in the quest book, Quimath has the following letter:</p>

<p>You did well by infecting the formian city of Klictrik with the Iron Shadow.  As predicted, the Lillendi obtained the help of some foolish adventures.  Thanks to our false divination, the adventures succeeded in spreading the Iron Shadow where ever they went.  With each creature that is infected the power of the Quicksilver Hourglass grows.  We will soon begin the final rituals.  When all the life has been drained from the Prime world of Abeir-Toril you and your Kytons will have your pick of what ever continent you desire.  Use the Rogue stone to Planeshift your self and my pet to our meeting place as soon as the pawns have been dealt with.  Then you shall witness something truly great:  the end of a world. </p>

<p>The note is signed with only a strange mark.<br />
 </p>

<p>Once Quimath is defeated, Jazriul suggests they return to his lady’s strong hold on the elemental plane of fire.  If the PCs agree, Jazriul uses a greater amulet of the planes to transport himself and the party to the stronghold.</p>

<p>Stronghold</p>

<p>Butler:  Ignition/Inferno, an ettin paragon</p>

<p>Once the PCs arrive at the stronghold Ojhalia tells them what she knows, see Chapter 1:  Seven Days to Death, in the Quicksilver Hourglass.</p>       </div>

         <p>Yeps it is. As is a good part about epic adventuring. And about everything in between.<img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/wink.png" title="Eye-wink" alt="Eye-wink" class="smiley-content"/></p>

<p>Planewalker hasn't updated any of the older modules and as I recall this one in 2nd ed allowed specifically for modification to characters of a higher level in the first place - so this is in the spirit of the work in that regards. <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/wink.png" title="Eye-wink" alt="Eye-wink" class="smiley-content"/> So - much thanks!
