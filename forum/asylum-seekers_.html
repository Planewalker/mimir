         <p>"Alrigh' yer Holiness, yer arse is going in there whether ye like it or not. Don't look at me like that!" snarls one of the guards. "You've been 'ere ten years and it's about time someone did something about it. So help me, if I get word you started trying to rope the others into yer barmy schemes to torch the Mortuary I'll make sure to have you skinned alive."</p>

<p><span style="color:red">"I'm sorry, I don't speak clueless."</span> quips an accented male voice.</p>

<p>The guard curses viciously and opens the door, shoving a tall githzerai man into the room with such force that he nearly crashes to his knees. Hissing softly, the new arrival parts the curtain of long, matted black hair from his angular face, causing the manacles around his wrists to clink against each other. Were it not for his currently disheveled appearence he could have been considered somewhat handsome for a scion of the sundered gith races. His amber eyes narrow in a calculating manner, as though filing the interior of the room as well as the other 'residents' into his memory. For a moment the githzerai remains silent.  </p>

<p><span style="color:red">"That sodding idiot will get what's coming to him later."</span> he smiles serenely. <span style="color:red">"Won't be the first time someone crossed me and got in over their head.....lovely turban, by the way. Your faces seem familiar, have we met before? Well, if I've forgotten your names please don't hold it against me.....so many people coming and going all the time makes it nigh impossible to keep a list of allies and enemies."</span></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>A little while later, two more guards appear: longtime residents of the Gatehouse might recognize these as two of the most physically strong guards in this section.  They usually come out when escorting an inmate that is believed to pose a significantly greater physical threat than average.  Though they seem a bit wary, the guards are neither sweating nor truly afraid, as they often are when escorting the most violent of barmies:  cannibals, serial killers, arsonists, those who cut up puppies for entertainment, and so forth.</p>

<p><span style="color:darkred">"I don't belong here,"</span> their 'guest' argues, rather calmly given the circumstances.  The 'guest' in question appears to be a half-orc, with a substantial amount of something Lower Planar added in.  </p>

<p>A very <span style="font-weight:bold">large</span> half-orc.  </p>

<p>A very large, <span style="font-weight:bold">female</span> half-orc.  </p>

<p>A very large, female, <span style="font-weight:bold">muscular</span> half-orc.  </p>

<p>So much so that, despite both orcish and lower-planar ancestry, she must certainly have to do a considerable amount of work to maintain that much muscle definition and tone.  When not in the Gatehouse, perhaps she's a bouncer or bodyguard or some other sort of basher.  Or a thug.  Her voice is also deep:  a contralto, and she could probably manage a countertenor without too much effort.</p>

<p><span style="color:orange"><span style="font-weight:bold">"Oh, we've heard that one before, haven't we?"</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color:gray"><span style="font-weight:bold">"Plenty of times!"</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color:darkred">"You'd rather put me in a... a <span style="font-style:italic">madhouse</span>, than listen to the truth?  And you call me -- <span style="font-style:italic">me!</span> -- the barmy one?"</span></p>

<p><span style="color:orange"><span style="font-weight:bold">"What is it this time -- Cage's portals will all open up to the Plane of Fire and burn everyone up?  That was a good one."</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color:darkred">"You forget what happened two weeks after I said that?"</span></p>

<p><span style="color:orange"><span style="font-weight:bold">"We didn't all burn up, now did we?  Now, go on and meet your new... heh heh... roommates.  And don't go starting any fights, either."</span></span></p>

<p>The guards get their new... guest... inside the room without further incident.  At least this one is neither straitjacketed, attacking other inmates, nor... currently... raving.  She doesn't look very friendly, though.  In fact, one might receive the impression that this one firmly believes she is <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> insane, and is not reacting well to being shoved into a room full of 'barmies.'  </p>

<p>One might notice further details.  Her skin is a grey-green color, like that of many orcs, but those red, fiery-perdition-colored eyes practically scream out 'TIEFLING!'  The very thick, black hair probably came from her orcish side.  The small, surprisingly dainty-looking horns on her head did not.  Despite these details, there was a human, or at least something a lot more human-appearing than an orc or a fiend, in her family tree somewhere, since her features are softer and much more human-looking than those of an orc.  </p>

<p>She stands with her back to one of the walls, rubbing the skin around whatever bonds she's been put in (they chafe, apparently), and glowering at the other... guests... of the Gatehouse.  She doesn't seem very inclined to introduce herself.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><span style="color:darkgreen">"Welcome Na'Sahlih.  Welcome, Uma."</span>  The orc/tiefling quickly realizes she has not yet introduced herself by name, yet the bound medusa seems to know her already.  <span style="color:darkgreen">"I am Shist, and my *ahem* companion is Indigo, both in hue and in name."</span></p>

<p><span style="color:indigo">"Indigo Evening Flashes and Rumbles with the Approaching Storm ... but you can call me Igo if you want.  I actually prefer the quick version."</span>  Indigo is indeed a bluish-purple, each of his scales fading to blue at the edge.  He is small for a typical lizard folk, only five foot tall and rather thin.  In fact he looks like an indigo kobold, though significantly larger than any other specimen of that race.  That he prefers 'the quick version' is not surprising, since though he is sitting on his bunk he rocks back and forth with barely-contained nervous energy.</p>

<p><span style="color:darkgreen">"Yes, well, welcome to the reintroduction dorm.  Evidently you were both judged sane enough, or safe enough, to be housed with others.  The idea, I believe, is to practice interacting with other beings in preparation for an eventual release back into Sigilan society.  In practice, however, I have been here for quite some time, and Indigo seems to keep coming back."</span></p>

<p><span style="color:indigo">"PIKE IT, STONER!  I TOLD YOU SHE TRIED TO NICK ME!"</span>  The big kobold suddenly snaps at her.  He leaps off his bunk and grabs a chair.  He flings it, not at her but at a random wall instead.  His reptilian eyes are amber-colored, and now start to spark with tiny arcs of electricity.  He whispers hoarsely in draconic and lightning dances from his claws.  He grabs his own biceps and there is a loud crackling sound and the smell of ozone as he shocks himself.  The action actually makes his muscles spasm and he falls to the floor.  It takes a couple of minutes, but when he recovers and can stand again, Igo seems calmer, satisfied.  He quiveringly climbs back on his bunk and lies down with a contented sigh.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>The half-orc/tiefling is immediately suspicious of anyone, in a place like the Gatehouse, trying to 'befriend' her -- especially if it's someone, scrawny gith or not, who obviously likes looking at her.  He hasn't touched her or gotten into her personal space, though.  He also has a rather fancy way of speaking, but she decides that he's probably just talking politely in the gith way.  (To the extent that giths are polite...)</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>Azure</em> wrote:</div>"Yes, well, welcome to the reintroduction dorm. Evidently you were both judged sane enough, or safe enough, to be housed with others..."</div></p>

<p>She listens to the -- <span style="font-style:italic">Dukagsh, I'm sharing a room with a medusa</span> -- then openly stares as Indigo... demonstrates why he's here.  <span style="color:darkred">"Who does the judging?"</span>  From her tone, she probably thinks whoever that person is, is <span style="font-style:italic">also</span> a maniac.</p>

<p>The big half-orc looks at the githzerai who had introduced himself, and speaks to him... and the room as a whole, really.  <span style="color:darkred">"As...Shist... said, I am called Umbrukh-Uma.  I greet you."</span>  While she wonders how Shist knows of her, Uma also knows that she has a small amount of local 'fame' as a storyteller and future-peerer, and assumes that the medusa has heard of her because of this.</p>

<p>She looks toward Indigo, but doesn't comment on him... directly.  <span style="color:darkred">"Why did they decide to put you in here, Shist?  And you, Na'Sahlih?"</span>  She actually gets the pronunciation right, or very close to it.  </p>

<p>Despite not being really a font of either diplomacy or wisdom, Uma manages not to ask 'What kind of barmy are you?' outright.  It's what she's thinking, though.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>She has been around the Asylum for as long as anyone can remember.. nearly 100 years.. and hasn't changed a bit, and this makes her a bit of an enigma, as no one alive can remember how she got here or why, she simply <span style="font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">had been here</span></span> when most entered it for their first time.</p>

<p>For those who had been here for a decent while, whenever it was lunch time she would be escorted by three guards and a Mage-guard at all times when outside her cell, so it wasn't difficult to spot her whenever she would enter the refectory*.</p>

<p>That, and the fact she is very exotic to look at, having the soft scaled skin with colours ranging from greenish-yellow belly and chest area, darker green on her "backside" and face and shoulders, with the spine area a dark, almost black blue..<br />
Her eyes... yes her eyes..  a shiny dark malachite blazes from her eye-sockets...without any pupils that can be seen.<br />
Another peculiar thing about her facial features is the fact that she has two large whiskers (not unlike those of Gold Dragons) on the sides of her mouth, like snakes that gently move in a breeze... her actual hair on top of her head is cut as a Mohawk but long and pure darkness flowing over her back.<br />
 <br />
*current scene*<br />
Through the hallway from the cells you are in, you see some coruscating flash of multicoloured hues of light accompanied by some harsh foul language of what you presume what is the guards..<br />
Then you hear some more cursing (in a very exotic language thats difficult to understand) and rattling of chains and a loud hiss that you cannot place other then that it would be some huge snake making such a sound...<br />
then around the corner come walking the female (described above) accompanied by 4 guards and a mage-guard, one of the guards is holding the shoulder of another in an attempt to be guided as he seems stunned and perhaps blinded..</p>

<p>The young looking woman is dressed in white furs and has some distinct bronze bracers around her forearms, she is also chained up with 2 big chains that hold her arms wide as the guards hold them in such a fashion as to keep her from moving her arms at all, they are strained by the effort to do so though.. <br />
The guards move her to the entrée of the holding cell and the guard-mage opens it up, to have the other guards unchain her and shove her in roughly, <br />
when she stumbles in, she (for as far as is apparent) glares at the guards, but says nothing...she looks for a place to stand, but not in the middle of the room, and makes her way there.. then proceeds to look at the others..</p>

         <p>Na'Sahlih's reply is interrupted by the arrival of the decidedly alluring prisoner he has seen on occasion, yet never attempted to engage in conversation.

<p>Umbrukh-Uma is no expert on giths, nor is she all that interested in gith culture, but she's lived in the City of Doors more than long enough (her whole life, in fact) to have picked up some basic things about them.  <span style="font-style:italic">A githzerai who went to the Astral Plane and back without getting himself shived?

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>Chaotic Goth</em> wrote:</div>"As much as I prefer to avoid unessescary casualties, I am willing to admit we may be forced to kill the guards."</div></p>

<p>The half-scro does not appear interested in this option -- at least, not at this stage.  She only just got here, after all.  She hasn't been here for ten years or more... unlike some...</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>Azure</em> wrote:</div>"Anyway, you needn't resort to such methods. There is a portal that periodically manifests in the doorway.

Disturbing... <span style="color:darkred">"Doesn't look like we have a lot of <span style="font-style:italic">things</span> between us.

<p>The large orc/tiefling does not look thrilled at the idea of what a room full of barmies can come up with when trying to figure out a portal key.  <span style="font-style:italic">Now what would the key be, to a portal leading OUT of a barmy house like this?</span></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Na'sahlih glances upward, intoning a barely-audible prayer, then sinks his teeth into the flesh of his left forearm. A gurgling, half-smothered groan of pain is heard as he bites harder, causing blood to trickle from the self-inflicted injury. Not satisfied, he drives his nails into the lacerated skin and starts smearing the blood on the walls, pausing only to aggravate the wound whenever the bleeding slows. Finally, the githzerai stops, licking the blood off his arm before tearing cloth from his shirt to bind the mangled injury. </p>

<p><span style="color:red">"This had better work." Na'Sahlih hisses.</span></p>

<p>He glares with a disconcertingly feral hunger in the direction of the kobold as if to indicate he would much rather have chewed through <span style="font-style:italic">Indigo's</span> arm instead.....perhaps his throat as well.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p><span style="color:red">"This had better work." Na'Sahlih hisses.</span></p>

<p></div></p>

<p>It does not.</p>

<p>Though Na'Sahlih succeeds in bleeding all over the stout wooden door, no portal opens.  It does, succeed, however, in getting the keepers' attention.  Before the githzerai can step back from the door in defeat, the eye-level port opens.  <span style="color:orange"><span style="font-weight:bold">"What's going on here?  Na'ss, is this your blood?  Who put you up to this?"</span></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile, Indigo watches with astonished amusement <span style="font-size:10px"><span style="color:indigo">"Tiamat's tits, he's really going to ... oh, the barmy berk ... can't kid an addle-cove, I guess ... "</span></span>  He shakes his head.  When the portal opens, however, the keeper proves a keen reader of the room and singles the indigo reptile out.</p>

<p><span style="color:orange"><span style="font-weight:bold">"You, Indigo!  Your forked tongue do this?  By the Powers, you're not fit for society, ANY society!  TRANSFER!"</span></span>  There is a sudden sound from the other side of the door, muffled at first but very quickly approaching.  The sound of movement of multiple suits of heavy armor.  The door is then unlocked [the party counts three locks, one of them a chain], and pulled open [note the hinges are on their side of the door].  A number of humanoids in plate thrust into the room.  They carry large tower shields and set up a protective cordon around the doorway.  The keeper, a tall human, stands just outside the doorway.  <span style="color:orange"><span style="font-weight:bold">"Well, Indigo?  Will you come along peacefully or do the guards have to beat the vinegar out of you?"</span></span></p>

<p>Before he can answer (and by the look in his eyes it was probably going to be "vinegar"), a melodic voice rings from further down the hall, <span style="color:blue">"Wait ... Hold that transfer.  Goris, what exactly is going on here?"</span></p>

<p><span style="color:orange"><span style="font-weight:bold">"Lady Slyff, I've got gith blood all over the place, and it looks like the little shock-addict set him off intentionally.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color:blue">"Then we shall summon a medical unit and a cleaning crew.  Do you not think there are elements in society that will seek to take advantage of our charges' mental state?  This program is to prepare them for such things.  Unless you truly believe a life is in danger, do not interfere with the dorm society ... ... ... Do you believe the gith's life in danger Goris?  Or the kobold's?  If so, then by all means ... "</span></p>

<p>Suddenly, Indigo jumps up.  The guards hunker behind their shields, ready for anything.  <span style="color:indigo">"Hey, PIKE YOU!  Pike ALL of you!  I'm no pikin' kobold!  You hear me?  Kobolds are little, weak, stupid.  I'm none of those things!  I'm a pikin' DRAGON, you hear me?  Step into the ring and I'll show you, berks. A DRAGON!

Better not be Plane of Fire...  The key might have something to do with whatever plane that is...</span></p>

<p>Umbrukh-Uma is obviously disgusted when the githzerai experiments with the idea that blood might be the gate-key.  It's not that she's especially squeamish; it's just that this is a strong reminder of the fact that she's in here with <span style="font-style:italic">a bunch of barmies</span>.  At least in her own mind, the half-orc/tiefling is quite sane.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Sod it, and me without so much as a toothpick.</span>  Well before the guards enter, Uma moves to the most darkened corner of the room she can find and assumes her best 'Don't mind me, I'm just minding my own business, now pike off' pose, with muscular arms crossed over her chest.  While most of the attention of the Gatehouse's minders is on Na'Sahlih and Indigo, the half-scro's eyes are looking the guards over for the location (and liftability) of any key rings or weapons.  She also attempts to memorize faces, at least as much as any helmets may allow.  It also occurs to her that if the minders reacted to the gith biting himself, they're probably <span style="font-style:italic">actively</span> watching the place, maybe by magical means.  </p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Fantastic.  The sods won't be able to keep one of these barmies from putting a shiv between my ribs while I'm asleep, but watching the lunatics is probably a lot of fun for them.</span></p>

<p>The half-scro/tiefling is strongly tempted to make a rude remark (and looks it, too), and somewhat tempted to say something to the more idealistic-seeming one, this Slyff.  Instinct, however, says to keep quiet.  This Goris basher can find someone else to bully.  <span style="font-style:italic">Right, now just leave us alone, you pikers.

<p>The githzerai merely licks the blood from his lips and mutters a few choice remarks in his native tongue under his breath, humiliated that his attempt failed miserably and managed to likely convince everyone in the room he was barmier than a Xaositect. Not to mention the possibility of the bite wound scarring! He makes an attempt to move but drops to his knees and winces.

<p>He lowers his eyes in shame, not daring to meet Umbrukh-Uma's gaze, or Indigo's, for that matter. When the guards begin to antagonize the…..dragon…..he clears his throat audibly, though his heart sinks, knowing he has probably destroyed all chances he ever had to finally leave the Gatehouse for good.</p>

         <p><span style="color:blue">"See?  Bluster and contrition.  Two reactions common enough to productive members of society.  The k- ... reptile's aggressive tendencies we may be able to suppress, in time.  For now our job is to monitor, Keeper Goris.  In this program most behavioral admonishment and reward is up to the society members, not us."</span></p>

<p>The tall human, Goris, grinds his teeth a little, but gives no order for the armored guards to remove anyone.  They stay in a ready stance around the door, though, until a healer arrives to look at the githzerai's arm.</p>

<p>Indigo turns away from everyone else and retreats to the commode, lightning still dancing from his forearms.  There is the sound of a splash, and a bright flash.  If anyone checks on him (there's no curtain, so you'd just need to go to the archway) they find him passed out under the water-basin.)</p>

<p>[DM- There are half a dozen armored guards.  They wear full plate armor and are armed with clubs.  Four of them carry tower shields, and the other two have nets.  Their armor and full helms make race identification only general.  By their armor, and small badges and embellishments, they appear to be Sons Of Mercy recruits, serving a requisite training assignment in the barmy bin.  Here they learn to use non-lethal force.  Every now and then you draw a newbie who's "still learning"]</p>

<p>[The PCs might note:  Only the armored guards actually enter the room, and Slyff stays down the hall far enough that the PCs can't even see her, though Uma may guess by her voice that she is an elf (eladrin, actually)]</p>

<p>The healer is a thin halfling priest.  He looks barely older than an altar-boy, but that may be because he's a halfling.  He is genuinely attentive to Na'Sahlih's wound, but seems on-edge.  He nervously blurts out that he's been here less than a week, and professes new-found experience with bite wounds.  If anyone thinks to ask his name, he answers <span style="color:brown">"Phil"</span> while trying to not make eye contact with the speaker.  Once he is done treating Na'Sahlih's arm, he fetches a bucket and mops up the blood.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><span style="color:brown">"Um ... I was told I shouldn't talk too much to you people, sorry."</span> is Phil's most common response, no matter how nice or reasonable the speaker.  Strangely, this also includes the guards who try to talk to him.  After he is done cleaning up all the blood (and he does such a thorough job, one might wonder if he is obsessive), Phil scurries out with a polite-but-nervous bow.</p>

<p>The guards continue their vigil by the door, as they are told it is near meal-time anyway.  The fact that this dorm is getting serviced first elicits a quiet argument between Slyff and Goris, but she convinces him that getting it over quickly is for the best.  A large upright cart with trays soon arrives, pushed by an ogre with a lobotomy scar.  Usually, the guards would just open the bottom port on the door and slide the trays in [this door design is common throughout the Gatehouse], leaving it open, along with the eye-port, until the meals are done and the tray returned.  The only difference this time is that the ogre is allowed to enter and place the trays on the table.  The ogre proves to be quite 'talkative' once its job is done, but it seems to know only sign language, wide sweeps of his massive limbs threatening to injure all of the room's occupants and destroy the furniture.  He cocks his head if anyone tries to address him verbally.  Evidently, he is deaf, and cannot read lips.  He shrugs and exits, back to his job pushing the food cart.  The potato soup is scalding hot, as are the potato pancakes.  There is a little bowl of steamed greens.  On Indigo's tray there is a pile of meat chunks in a thin broth in the bowl instead of vegetables, but he remains passed out under the sink, and his food will go back uneaten unless someone else decides to have it.</p>

<p>[DM - Na'Sahlih (and only he, since nobody else said 'spot check') notices that before the ogre exits, he looks longingly, not at the door but at the archway into the water-closet.  The seasoned githzerai has seen that look before; someone who knows about a portal but doesn't know the key.]</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Perhaps surprisingly, Umbrukh-Uma picks up one of the bowls of food and offers it to the weakened githzerai.  Scro <span style="font-style:italic">are</span> patriarchal, if a bit less nastily so than their savage orcish cousins; perhaps at least a few of their social customs have rubbed off.  As for herself, the half-scro is divided between feeling famished and feeling disgusted at the not-very-carnivore nature of what's been provided.  She had been looking at the meat on Indigo's tray, but the snake-woman had gotten to it first.</p>

<p>In fact, she looks at their keepers with some disgust, even indignation.  <span style="color:darkred">"You call this real food?  This is..."</span>  She holds a steamed vegetable between her thumb and index finger as if it were utterly inedible trash.  <span style="color:darkred">"This is elf slop!  Scro need meat.  The githzerai is hurt.  He needs real food, not this garbage."</span></p>

<p>[I imagine that scro (or orcs) can probably digest potatoes, or even vegetables, if they have to, but I'm pretty sure their diet leans heavily toward the carnivorous under normal circumstances.  I wouldn't be surprised if scro culture heavily emphasizes meat-eating, either.]</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Despite not being overly fond of the food served in the Gatehouse, Na'Sahlih is nevertheless touched by the half-scro's kind gesture and accepts the bowl, filing the archway in his memory to discuss with the others once the guards leave.</p>

<p><span style="color:red">"You have my thanks."</span> he nods, starting to eat the vegetables at a slow pace, though his body is screaming at him to devour the whole meal in one swallow.</p>

<p>The feral, predatory gleam in his eyes returns as he glances at each of the guards, seriously entertaining the thought of killing one for food to sustain his fellow inmates. Horrified, the githzerai cleric averts his gaze and decides to distract himself by looking at Umbrukh-Uma out of sheer desperation to prevent himself from attempting to tackle the nearest guard and tear out his throat with his teeth.</p>

<p><span style="color:red">"Have you been here before, Umbrukh-Uma?"</span> Na'Sahlih inquires out of genuine interest. </p>

<p><span style="color:darkred">"Thanks."</span>  Umbrukh-Uma makes very short work of several pieces of Indigo's intended dinner, apparently without much finicky concern for what it may taste like, or what it may have come from.  One might wonder whether being dragged into the Gatehouse had resulted in her missing breakfast.  She offers to share the bowl of meat and broth with the githzerai;  the half-scro might not be thrilled at his first attempt to create a gate-key, but apparently the fact that he's hurt makes her a bit more sympathetic toward him.</p>

<p>Hesitantly, he puts a consoling hand on her shoulder, placing the half-full plate of meat beside her and dares to approach the mysterious snake-woman, offering a polite bow of his head and keeping his gaze to the ground should she deem him a threat.</p>

<p><span style="color:darkred">"Sometimes a portal key has something to do with the plane it goes to.  Shist, do your snakes tell you anything about where the portal goes?"</span>  The half-scro hopes that the medusa is, in fact, wrong, and that Umbrukh-Uma will not be dreaming about this.  Dreams about portals to unknown planes are bad.  A lot of them involve fire.  Even those that don't involve fire are pretty bad.</p>

<p>So.  What kind of key would lead from the Gatehouse to...wherever?  It's probably not sanity (the guards are sane, right?) but the half-scro tries it, just to make sure.  Uma walks up to the 'portal' and thinks hard about Indigo Evening Flashes suddenly deciding he's not actually a dragon, or not being so barmy-hot tempered.  Or Shist not wanting to cut her eyes out, or her snakes off.  She's not sure about the githzerai or the snake-woman yet, so she imagines them both as boringly sane.</p>

<p>She doesn't think about herself any differently, though.  Her dreams are truth.</p>

<p>If that doesn't work, the half-scro thinks equally hard about 'freedom.'  Dukagsh knows, it's not hard to contemplate freedom in a place like this.  She imagines shackles breaking, chains being cut in two, masses of slaves rising against their masters, and so on.</p>

<p>If neither of these work, she announces <span style="color:darkred">"I was thinking that either sanity or freedom might be the key.  No luck, though."</span></p>

<p>Uma also looks around their meager surroundings for any objects that might be worth trying as portal keys.</p>

<p><span style="color:darkred">"Actually... maybe what the not-kobold said earlier is right.

         <p>Na'Sahlih looks as though he could kiss Umbrukh-Uma and mercifully restrains himself to giving her an elegant bow of aknowledgement. With an experienced glance at the portal, he hesitantly steps forward. A shiver tingles down his spine as he remembers the last time he went through a strange portal. The githzerai landed in the middle of a strange land with desert as far as the horizon, with a merciless sun and sand-worn ruins. He winces, recalling his hasty escape from an odd group of halflings who kept eyeing him like choice veal and the weeks spent struggling to survive in the unforgiving environment. Mercifully, the cleric had found a portal location leading to Sigil, though only after a series of rather embarrassing negotiations with an 'exotic' trader. She was.....most co-operative in the end.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

I'm a piking planewalker and here I've gone and made a Clueless' error!" He growls as he clutches at his long, black hair, his normally formal manner of speech decaying rapidly into the rougher one he aquired in Sigil. </p>

<p>"It was a desert-prime......with halflings that nearly ate me......slave-traders, gladiators, inscect-creatures and I thought I saw a few gith at one time.......the world was dying, I think. Maybe that was what closed the portal. My mind was too focused on a foolish mistake I made long ago."</p>

<p>The cleric starts snarling to himself in the githzerai dialect. He knows better than to approach Umbrukh-Uma or any of the other inmates, lest they decide to kill him there and then for his momentary lapse of reason. Finally, he calms himself enough to retreat to a corner and meditate, focusing on clearing his mind of anything which might possibly distract the efforts of Umbrukh-Uma further.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p><span style="font-style:italic">And where would a portal from a barmy-house go to?  Pandemonium!  That's it!</span>  </p>

<p>Of course, there are lots of other planes that have caves in them, even the Prime -- the Underdark for one.  It's <span style="font-style:italic">probably</span> Pandemonium, though.</p>

<p>The half-scro thinks about what might have gotten the portal to try to open before.  Not disgust...  </p>

<p>She had <span style="font-style:italic">really not wanted</span> to go through a portal leading to a sewer-plane, or some other nasty part of the Abyss.</p>

<p>Umbrukh-Uma decides to think a lot about why taking a portal to Pandemonium would be a really, really bad idea.  That 'going insane' thing, for one.  (She, Umbrukh-Uma, of course, is completely sane.  The rest of these sods are barmy, though.  That one who thinks he's a sodding dragon...)  The idea of utterly losing her mind and wandering the caverns of Pandemonium forever... maybe the Gatehouse is actually a better idea.  </p>

<p>There are Powers on Pandemonium too.  Not very nice ones mostly.  Wouldn't want to wander into the god-lair of one of them.  Thinking about nasty Powers, plus reasons to <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> go through the portal, causes another thought to occur to her.  <span style="font-style:italic">Yeah, what if mum's soul is wandering around somewhere on that Plane?</span>  </p>

<p>Probably not.  Probably.  <span style="font-style:italic">That's more 'out and out evil' than 'completely barmy,' right?  I mean, she's probably commanding at least a squad or two in the Abyss by now.  Or some other Lower Plane.</span>  Even so, Umbrukh-Uma is not sure enough to feel eager to go through that portal.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">
