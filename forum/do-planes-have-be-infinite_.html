          Do the planes have to be infinite?        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
        <div class="dice_rolls">
</div> <p>(First off, let me say right off the bat that I know that canon says some of the planes are infinite.  In this case, I'm not talking about what canon says; I acknowledge the fact in the printed material, but this thread is about if the positives of that canon outweigh the negatives.  I guess it's kind of like a minor-level PRP for an aspect of the multiverse as a whole or something.)</p>

<p>Talk in the new elemental plane thread got me thinking; is there really a huge reason to make the planes infinite?  I'm a mathematician-in-training, and I've got a lot of experience working with infinities.  And there are all sorts of unintended side effects as a result of that, especially among the Inner Planes.  It seems that the consequences of having something be infinite are often brushed over, or even simply not something the average person would be aware of.  On the Outer Planes this stuff seems like less of an issue to me since stuff works so strangely there anyway, so I'll focus mostly on the Inner here.  (And if anyone wants to know the specific justification for any of my points, I'll go into it, but I'm trying to avoid actual math unless it becomes necessary.)</p>

<p>For one, it was brought up that Mineral, if it was mostly made up of gems and jewels, would have a huge destabilizing effect on the interplanar economy.  People brought up ways to resolve that, including the worthwhile stuff being far less common and the populace of Mineral being so fervant about mining that it didn't happen.  But Mineral is infinite.  If there's any nonzero percentage of jewels and gems, even something like 1 * 10^-googolplex%, then there's an infinite amount of them.  Technically it's even possible there's an infinite amount if there's 0%, though that's harder to illustrate - it's part of the weirdness of infinity.  And it's not just mineral.  If there's a natural process by which oil could arise in Ooze like some people suggested (an awesome idea, by the way), then there's an infinite amount of oil there, no matter how rare that process is.</p>

<p>That's bad enough, but there's other issues too.  First, let's assume that stuff isn't clustered like it seems to be in the material.  I'll get to why I'm assuming something demonstrably false by canon after my descriptions, but first I want to go over the consequences of that.</p>

<p>There's issues with distance too.  If you take two areas on a given inner plane, the probability of them not being an infinite amount of distance apart is...well, it's hard to define probability of a single event over an infinite space.  But it would be literally equally likely to be any real number value apart, as meaningless as that is.  Not just the somewhat "local" numbers people are used to, which I'm counting as containing even seemingly tremendous values like the number of particles in the universe, Stokes' number, or other things like that, but literally every real number between 0 and infinity.  Even the concept of an average distance is meaningless over an infinite space in a situation like this.</p>

<p>Population too.  Are there a finite number of mortal species in the Inner Planes, or no?  If there are, then they should be distributed in the same way as the sites I mentioned above, and it should be a literally-0% chance for any two to be near enough to each other so as to have ever met in the history of the multiverse.  But if there aren't a finite number of mortal species, where are they getting an infinite amount of resources to survive on in the Inner Planes?  Even if they did get an infinite amount of food, that still might not be enough to feed them.  Because infinity is very weird.  And beyond that, what would the elementals and the mephits (which there should be an infinite number of if the Inner Planes are infinite, I imagine) think of having an infinite number of mortals in their realms?</p>

<p>There's other issues specific to certain planes that I probably haven't even thought of too - one that comes to mind now is that light should either be completely absent or infinitely intense in Air, and it definitely should be infinitely present in Lightning, a la <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olbers%27_paradox" class="bb-url">Olbers' paradox</a> - but these are some of the most blatant.</p>

<p>So let's instead go by the canon presentation of having stuff clustered "nearby" one another.  Either that means the Inner Planes are packed far more tightly than anyone probably would like them to be, or it means you've got a few million or billion people in a "small" area and an infinite amount of otherwise-empty space.  The latter you might be able to pull off, but then the question is "why is it arranged like that".  You can put the blame to portal dispersion, but you run into the infinity problem there too.  Why are there a finite number of portals?  And why aren't they "evenly" distributed throughout the plane, why are they locally clustered?  Every time you can push back the explanation a level, all you really do is pull the infinity problem up to another stage.</p>

<p>Now, I'm not going to do this whole spiel without proposing a solution - this was just to explain the problem as I see it with actually using infinity.  So how about this?</p>

<p>The infinite planes aren't actually infinite, they're just large 3D surfaces of a set of 4D structures making up the Inner Planes.  Or Outer Planes, if you generalized this to that.</p>

<p>For those of you that have read Infinite Staircase, you already know what that means.  It's like Maelost.  If you go far enough in one direction, eventually you wrap back around to where you started.  Not just in 2D, but in 3D even; if you went far enough up, you'd get back to where you started too.  And travel from one plane to another could be by natives being able to sense 4D pathways from one plane to another and somehow follow them in 3-space.  The planes would then be finite in size, but unbounded.  And if you make it large enough - say, Ringworld size, something in the tens-of-thousands-of-planetary-surfaces level - you still get the truly boundless feel to it as well, which is the really important part I think.  There are other ways you could do it too - personally, I've always liked thinking of the Hinterlands being a result of the Outlands being a hyperbolic plane, a mathematical construct with an infinite amount of space in a finite circle because the space gets more crunched together the closer you get to the edge of the circle, and maybe the concept of the Hinterlands could be expanded to all the planes the same way. <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/lol.png" title="Laughing out loud" alt="Laughing out loud" class="smiley-content"/></p>

<p>But anyway, what do the rest of you think?  Are there good reasons I'm not seeing beyond "it's canon" to leave the planes as truly infinite, and should these issues just be left ignored?  Are there resolutions I'm not seeing to the problems here?  I'd appreciate any comments or criticism to this.</p>       </div>

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Well, I think one has to consider the difference between whether the Planes are infinite on a practical level, or whether they are literally infinite. Technically speaking, there is no way to distinguish these two possibilities in Planescape, because no one has the ability to actually measure the planes, especially since they don't conform to predictable laws (arguably a wish spell might do it, but the knowledge of great beings has no bearing on common understanding).</p>

<p>Really, our universe isn't that different. Depending on who you ask, our universe is 15-18 billion light years in radius, or infinite in size, with potentially countless "bubble" universes that are effectively distinct because their distance is far enough and expanding fast enough that no information can pass between that bubble and any other bubble. Thus, the expansion of our universe means our universe has no truly definable boundaries, and is effectively infinite in scope. The infinite nature of our universe has no real bearing upon our day to day lives, and generally isn't worth considering when contemplating, for example, the infinite amount of Diamonds in the universe. The limited nature of our own existence makes much of the infinite nature of the rest of the universe an irrelevant if interesting detail. We remain mortal and limited by our means. </p>

<p>The same applies for anyone in the Planescape world. The potential of infinity is incomprehensible by its very nature, which is mostly what Planescape tries to play up. The reality of what an actual being can do with that is extremely confined, so most of those problem you bring up really aren't problem at all practically speaking. In the actual life of any given thing, reality is extraordinarily finite when placed next to the scale of the multiverse. The planes are infinite, so anything truly is possible, but the actual stuff that seems to mostly define the interactions of the planes as written in Planescape are limited to an incredibly small slice of it. Is the rest of it vast nothingness? Maybe. It may also be an incredibly complex series of other worlds of interaction that is simply unknown to the average denizen of the Planes as written. Doesn't mean it isn't there. Just means it's not the part focused upon.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Short answer (well, short for me at least):  It's a conceit of the game system and not really meant to represent anything coherent with regards to the real world.  </p>

<p>From inside the setting though, I seem to recall reading about how the elementals and other natives are the only ones able to navigate on the Inner Planes with any sort of reliability and that if anybody really wants to travel around, you need to talk to the natives, otherwise you're not going to get very far.  I can't help but think of the Inner Planes has somehow having extra spacial dimensions that make perfect sense to a native, but non-natives remain blind to.  Moving towards Mineral from Earth makes perfect sense to an earth elemental, but given that both planes are infinite, you can't really drop down a literal border.  Consider also how the Ethereal borders all of the Inner Planes. Just from that alone you can tell there's some really strange stuff going on with the spacial dimensions of the whole arrangement.</p>

<p>Thinking about this some more, I'd consider a sort of bound space for non-natives, and infinite potential space for natives.  The bound space could expand if/when non-natives are guided to and settle in some of that infinite space.  It would draw a distinction between the heavily settled areas that kind of exist at the fringe of a given Inner Plane and it's core.  It could also be thought of how beliefs manifest themselves on the Inner Planes.  Going from an infinite potential to something finite and realized.</p>

<p>Given all of that, and going back to the Mineral example, it would make sense how, even though there's an infinite space filled with nothing but precious metals and gemstones, you'd never convince a native to guide you to it.  And non-natives can't inherently navigate around that infinite space, so even if they reached the plane and started mining that gold seam, they lack the ability to move into that extra-dimensional space and are stuck with wherever the seam ends for them.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

          Re: Do the planes have to be infinite?        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>First, a comment on the infinite gold: I try working backward and looking for whatever assumptions are necessary to get the literary flavor of world I want.  Gold is rare and valuable on the Prime.  This is despite the fact that there exists an infinite plane of Mineral, which is supposedly packed with it.  We have a <span style="font-style:italic">Plane Shift</span> spell that can take fairly competent mages there, with shovels.  Why aren't the Prime Material economies wrecked, or at least finding gold valueless?  It must be hard to get out.  Canon says it's essentially defended by Mineral elementals.</p>

<p>Okay, so what if basically <span style="font-style:italic">every</span> gold deposit is defended?  How does that happen?  Well, why not have it simply happen when the deposit is found.  Theory: animate elementals arise on the Inner Planes basically when minds interact with their plane's material.  Happy and helpful elementals seek to advance their element in some physical or spiritual fashion, probably increasing its amount and perceived utility.  Angry elementals are generated when minds seriously disturb the arrangement and content of the plane.  So basically, mining Mineral <span style="font-style:italic">makes</span> pissed-off mineral quasielementals.  Assuming that the gold is distributed in ores rather like those that appear on the Prime, if a bit more densely packed (not unreasonable, since apparently ores on the Prime arise from the images of those on the Plane of Earth).  Then the mine will be a little easier to run per volume of ore distracted, except for the part where you're paying heavily for security to constantly fight off attacks by angry, implacable spirits.  That cost could easily overwhelm your profit margin compared to a mine on the Prime.</p>

<p>Add in the assumption that you still have to find the things, that the portals from any given Prime are few in number (remember, portals are holes in the fabric of space, so a vibrant Prime will probably have a tendency to "heal" -- to grind them closed and seal them over the ages!), that portals from different Primes are usually large distances from each other (distances traversable to elementals and mortal they're carrying, who know the shorter dimensions that 3-D mortals can't see) but on average at least the diameter of a crystal sphere if walked physically, so that near any given Prime the possible sites are often already claimed and at least work is being attempted; then finding, setting up, and working a new mine is at least as hard as it is on the Prime.  In fact, if we assume an equilibrium economy it's exactly as hard, since whichever's easier will get done when there are resources available.</p>

<p>-----</p>

<p>Turning to infinities, I alluded to my solution to this problem above.  Basically, Primes pop up cosmologically when there's sufficient raw elements available in some sort of dimensionally congruent region -- or maybe the Powers who make Primes clear out such areas, or whatever.  So on elemental planes there are regions that largely correspond to a given Prime's crystal sphere, and this is where an unplanned <span style="font-style:italic">plane shift</span> or natural elemental portal is likely to pop you out.  Thus, primes from different worlds are extremely unlikely to interact unless something traumatic happens.</p>

<p>Major features like the City of Brass, the Great Dismal Delve, and other elemental homes are <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> in these regions; they're in the inter-sphere space, which is much more populated with elemental natives, and much less likely to hold hospitable pockets of non-native elements.  Portals to such places, or plane shifts to them, must be made with intent, or at least it's probability zero that a random plane shift will bring one there.  Once there is such a unique place, that place has a true name and a planar identity, so that it can be targeted.</p>

<p>What you're worried about is a variant of Olbers' paradox -- if the universe is infinitely big, and there are infinitely many stars, why isn't the night sky infinitely bright?  Or, if there are infinitely many Primes and infinitely many mortal races, why aren't they all crowding the Inner and Outer Planes, or infinitely many Great Dismal Delves?  Answer here is the same as it is in our universe -- the Multiverse is <span style="font-style:italic">expanding</span>!  The Positive keeps creating new elemental materials, which cascade through the Quasielemental planes and coalesce in the elementals, eventually dropping entropically into the Negative.  The elemental planes provide the material for new Primes (either naturally or by the intervention of Powers).  More Primes means more mortals and more belief, which makes the Outer Planes bigger.</p>

<p>So there might be another Great Dismal Delve out there, but it's not the one that you know of, the one that kidnapped King Midas of that neighboring country two centuries ago.  It's the equivalent of galaxies away.  There might be another Bridge of al-Sihal, on a Mt. Celestia so far across a conceptually-perfect (but empty) Silver Sea that not so much as a gleam comes to the Planescape regions.  (Note that there doesn't have to be, since the path that leads to Chronias is perceived uniquely by most travelers.  A petitioner going us his bridge from one of those alternate Prime clusters might be completely invisible to you while he's doing it.)</p>

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Movement on the inner planes is weird, and doesn't correspond to how it works on the Material Plane. Even though they represent physical matter, they don't contain physical space in the same way the Material Plane does. They don't contain zero space like the Astral Plane, but it's arguable that, as domains within the Ethereal, much of the infinity of the Inner Planes is only potential, tucked away in some wellspring of infinite hypothetical matter continually churning out new material only to let it fade away again if no one is directly observing it. Even if it's all actual space, somehow, the fact of the matter is that it takes a non-infinite amount of time to travel from one "end" of an Inner Plane to another. In fact, it takes only 10-100 hours (<span style="font-style:italic">The Inner Planes</span>, page 12). That's not a big area, in any practical sense; it's (at most) four days of travel, or roughly 100 miles if this were the Material Plane plains and everyone had an average human movement rate.</p>

<p>So is every Inner Plane 10-100 miles across? Not exactly; they're weird. You can fit a lot more things into an inner plane than that number would suggest. You can fit, potentially, an infinite number of things. But of course no one's going to ever see anywhere near that much, no matter how many times they travel all the way from the border between Earth and Ooze to the border between Earth and Magma, or between Mineral and Dust, or even if they travel all the way from Earth to Magma to Fire to Smoke to Air to Ice to Water to Ooze and back to Earth again, a journey which takes 80-800 hours in total travel time, not counting rests. If you want to find specific trading towns along the way, though, it takes considerably longer. If you want to stop in the City of Brass while you're in Fire, you're looking at an additional 4-40 days of travel on the Plane of Fire alone, or the equivalent of traveling 100-1000 miles out of your way just to see something other than monotonous flame, then another 10-100 hours to get to Smoke or another border assuming you don't use a portal, vortex, or other form of planar travel as a shortcut.</p>

<p>And here's where you start to see the infinity, because even with a native guide, every single overland journey within a single inner plane takes 100-1000 hours, no matter how fine you slice it. So an inner plane is really like a small region 10-100 miles across that you can slice into an unlimited amount of 100-1000 mile chunks. </p>

<p>Another weird thing is that these travel times take place in directions that non-natives simply can't perceive. This has been explained as a dimension of sorts; by implication, primes (and outer planars) are three-dimensional beings and elementals are four-dimensional beings, or at least are beings who can see and travel in four dimensions. The elemental planes are infinite in three-dimensional space; you can travel across them forever and never find anything (not veins of valuable minerals, not settlements, not anything) but monotonous elemental material unless you get a hint on where the secret dimension is (which you apparently perceive as one of the three dimensions, but isn't), in which case places are suddenly findable. So a non-native can travel across the Plane of Mineral for centuries and never find anything but relatively worthless crystal. If they meet an elemental or tsnng, it's because those creatures were able to detect a non-native and deliberately sought the sod out. And it's going to take them 100-1000 hours to get to you, no matter where in the plane they were initially, so it'll be a while. You're not going to meet anyone accidentally, not unless you're in a settlement. That means, except in settlements or other sites of interest, there should never be any random encounters on the Inner Planes for the first 100 hours the party is there. Jem's suggestion that elementals are created by intruders is interesting, but even granted that, the party isn't going to meet anyone but elementals for a good few days. 'Course, if they got there via a vortex or portal, they're starting out in a place of significance, and there might be guards or what have you already posted nearby, ready to either start an encounter right away or follow the party at a discrete distance to meet up at a time of their choosing.</p>

<p>Now, you don't always need a native guide. An <span style="font-style:italic">elemental compass</span> won't help you find any place or person in specific, but it'll get you to the next plane over if all you want is to circumnavigate the Great Wheel or get the hell out of Dodge. A <span style="font-style:italic">beacon seed</span> is magicked to get you to one place in particular, so you can use it to find the City of Brass from anywhere else in the Inner Planes, but then you'll need a portal, vortex, a compass, another beacon seed, or access to the Ethereal to get from the City of Brass to anywhere but the infinite trackless wastes of the Elemental Plane of Fire. </p>

<p>Anyhow, looking at the Inner Planes in terms of percentages isn't going to get you anywhere. If the Quasielemental Plane of Mineral is 10% pure diamond, then that 10% of the plane is completely unfindable to anyone except a native or someone with a <span style="font-style:italic">beacon seed</span>. And to make a beacon seed, you need to have visited the diamond vein before, which means you need a native guide. The population of any inner plane is probably finite. A finite number of elementals is plenty to reach any point worth visiting on the infinite plane. Any settlements on the plane are probably located around a portal or vortex (or, I suppose, a vein of valuable minerals or the like), so that non-natives can find it and locals have a way to get somewhere else. There are probably a few settlements where the founders got lost and found a way to survive wherever they happened to be, eventually producing something worth the natives' time in visiting and guiding others to.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>(Sorry for not using quote blocks here, but I didn't want to make another hugepost)</p>

<p>It looks like for the most part you're proposing something kind of similar to my finite bounded space alternate idea, <span style="font-weight:bold">Rip</span>?  The 3d-vs.-4d division with natives being able to exploit the 4d properties of the inner planes and nonnatives having no ability to?  Just a different way of presenting that fact.  I like that version of it too.  Same with the resolution of the infinite problem, that nonnatives just have no ability to get around so it doesn't end up being an issue.  The only problem with that I see is what about native races that want to exploit the plane as well, like the dao?  Though if you did also have the population be finite like you suggest, that certainly settles that too.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Jem</span>, that's a neat idea too, that doing something like that is what <span style="text-decoration:underline">causes</span> elementals to form in the first place.  I'm not sure if it's something I'd personally use in my game, but I love the concept of it, at least. <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/lol.png" title="Laughing out loud" alt="Laughing out loud" class="smiley-content"/></p>

<p>And I wouldn't say these are worries, exactly.  Just that I saw something that wasn't just not realistic as Kobold Avenger presented it, but outright contradictory, and I was trying to figure out a way to have it be something else instead that was just as cool.  Your resolution of Olbers' Paradox w.r.t. the Inner Planes is interesting too, though I wouldn't call that expanding exactly.  That more brings to mind the idea of tectonic plates continuously being formed out of the mantle on one side, and dropping back into it on the other.  But it's a great mental image, I really love the imagery of that too. <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/lol.png" title="Laughing out loud" alt="Laughing out loud" class="smiley-content"/></p>

<p>I'd also say that I like to do exactly what you do in dealing with a problem like this.  Figure out what needs to be true in order to support my version of the multiverse and all, like you describe with the infinite gold stuff.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Wicke</span>, I think you're also saying the same thing as Rip and I in a different way too.  Having natives have some special extradimensional ability to navigate about the plane that nonnatives don't.  I like how a bunch of us sort of had the same resolution to the problem, just stated in different ways.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Archduke</span>...I don't know.  That seems to brush off the problem rather than resolve it.  You're right that, should the universe be infinite, our part of it would still be finite, and so it doesn't matter.  But that doesn't really apply to Planescape, where you have beings that are able to deal with infinities.  If we could jump from Earth to any part of the universe instantaneously and back again, then it would make a pretty huge difference if the universe were infinite or finite, the only reason it doesn't for us is because we actually have to travel between places.  So when you mix plane shifting and teleportation into the mix in D&amp;D, this comes out.  There are plenty of good ways to resolve it; not just the thing I said, but Jem, Rip, and Wicke's posts too, and I really prefer those to just saying "don't worry about it".</p>

<p>And <span style="font-weight:bold">Kobold Avenger</span>, like I said in my response to Jem, I'm not saying it's <span style="text-decoration:underline">unrealistic</span>.  I'm saying it doesn't make sense, not in comparison to the real world, but that it's self-contradictory.  I mean, I don't think one can really say that having elementals navigating in four dimensions in order to proceed between parallel bounded spaces is <span style="text-decoration:underline">more</span> realistic than having infinite spaces.</p>

<p>Besides, I find these kinds of concepts more interesting than just going "oh no, it's infinite".  Infinity is <span style="text-decoration:underline">boring</span>, to be perfectly honest, compared with a set of wrap-around spaces connected through 4D pathways.  At least, cardinality-of-the-rationals infinity is.  Now, if we somehow had a plane with size aleph-1 or something, now you're talking. <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/tongue.png" title="Sticking out tongue" alt="Sticking out tongue" class="smiley-content"/></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

          Re: Do the planes have to be infinite?        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>One point I want to make that I think often goes overlooked with this economic challenge to an infinite multiverse is that as long as it still takes a given set of time to exploit an element, there will still be supply and demand.  Given the labor and material costs involved in the exploitation of any good, you can still reasonably expect a market to exist. Even in the real world, we have weird market dynamics wherein incredibly abundant materials like diamonds still have inflated prices because of labor costs (or more strictly the costs of production) and the existence of effective monopolies wherein the supply of goods is tightly controlled. Even with an infinite supply of any given resource, as long as we assume labor is limited (and perhaps that "rarer" minerals are more time consuming to harvest) and a desire for elementals or other creatures seeking to exploit minerals  to serve their own interests, they have reason to control their market tightly and maximize profits (especially when you add in the danger for not natives). If there is a limited supply of labor, the market would still demand various prices based on the difficulties in extracting the raw material. Prices might be reasonably stable, since the conditions of extraction would pretty much remain fixed (although the politics surrounding various enterprises may have some impact), but there would still be a cost. Interestingly, that would mean prices would more closely reflect a labor theory of value ala Marxism, which makes for all sorts of neat political and philosophical conflict.</p>

<p>Personally, I find answers to these types of questions that are sort of intrinsic to the mysticism of Planescape to be much less compelling than the questions. Planescape defies the physics of our reality, and much of it is designed to present players with Big Questions rather than merely technical obstacles, so it's difficult to justify the strict application of our own understanding of physical reality (or metaphysical reality for that matter). You can always posit solutions to these questions certainly. (Another possible answer to your question is that the planes have an infinite surface with a finite space ala Gabriel's Horn (which can double as a badass Artifact), which may make it easy for a native to navigate who understands or can perceive the shape of their universe, but no so much for the clueless traveler, and it also ends up a convenient explanation for the fixed travel times and the possibility for infinite wandering if you are going in the wrong direction despite a fixed area). However, I think having an answer to that kind of built in planar paradox ends up robbing it of some of its mystique (much like wanting to stat the lady of pain). </p>

<p>I guess my point is, whenever you dig too deeply into requiring a "rational" explanation for things that are only bound by the imagination, and which don't actually follow any strict set of rules that can be materially determined, you don't really get very meaningful answers, you just get new questions. That can sometimes produce a really interesting idea (I like much of what Rip and Jem suggest for example), but unless it somehow pertains to the story of the planes, I'm not sure an answer is really necessary. If anything, I think the question itself is far more compelling than any particular answer provided (and unique to Planescape, the conflict inherent in the factions and multiverse that exists in trying to resolve these sorts of questions).  I would rather have various parties offering up all the explanations provided (Guvners suggesting elementals as 4 dimensional beings, signers suggesting elementals are actually created by virtue of the presence of a mind, the Bleak Cabal suggesting there isn't any answer to be found and so on, each a valid idea in the planesape context), with the interpretation ultimately up to the players. When the DM has a strict interpretation of these things, it tends to suggest a particular view of the multiverse is unambiguously correct, which robs the world of much of its flavor. It would be akin to having (a) God come down and tell us that actually as it turns out, the Zoroastrians have the right of it. </p>

<p>To give an analogy, while it is fascinating to know how our own universe works in ever greater detail, that knowledge is not often necessary for a story to be told, even if it does occasionally play a role, and ultimately there are a lot of very good challenges to even seemingly well footed materialistic explanations of the universe (Wittgenstein comes to mind). In Planescape, the questions are often what drive the story forward. The answers are often far less satisfying. I think that was the thrust of the joke of Douglas Adam's series, wherein the answer to the meaning of life was 42. No answer to any big question is likely to be as mystical, transcendent and compelling as the nature of the question itself, and trying to give a concrete answer to something as philosophically challenging as the paradox of infinity is to me I guess off the mark.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Your thoughts are interesting. </p>

<p>I understand all planes work more or less similar regarding infinity. As far as I know, the real world material plane, our universe, is infinite, as well. <br />
Maybe we should assume that habitable areas in the inner planes are just as rare as habitable areas in our universe. If I'm not mistaken, there's supposed to be an infinite number of habitable planets in reality... somewhere. Since fantasy worlds furthermore enjoy a wider range of sentient species than our planet, anyway, even one (merely Earth-sized) important elemental habitable-planet-equivalent with lots of interplanar contact could very well form the populated "center" of it's plane - the evenly distributed population of the rest of the plane just isn't important, and possibly unknown, too.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>Calmar</em> wrote:</div><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>Idran</em> wrote:</div>But anyway, what do the rest of you think?  Are there good reasons I'm not seeing beyond "it's canon" to leave the planes as truly infinite, and should these issues just be left ignored?  Are there resolutions I'm not seeing to the problems here?  I'd appreciate any comments or criticism to this.</div></p>

<p>Your thoughts are interesting. </p>

<p>I understand all planes work more or less similar regarding infinity. As far as I know, the real world material plane, our universe, is infinite, as well. </div></p>

<p>That's actually not just unknown, but unknowable given the travel time of light, gravity, and anything else we might be able to use to tell.  All that's known is the <span style="text-decoration:underline">observable</span> universe is a sphere with a radius of about 46.5 billion light-years, and the radius of the universe as a whole must be between 39.1 billion light-years and infinite depending on the curvature of the universe.  (Not a contradiction; like I mentioned before, the universe itself might be finite but unbounded with closed curvature, so go far enough to the left, for example, and you'd end up coming back from the right to where you started.  This would result in visible duplication of structure if you looked far enough out, though, and observations out as far as 39.1 billion light-years have failed to find any such duplication.)  If you accept certain credible assumptions of the rate of expansion immediately following the Big Bang, you can move that lower bound up to within an order of magnitude of 1 billion trillion trillion (10^33) light-years; huge, but still way below infinite.</p>

<p>Interesting, tangentially-related note; even given the travel time of light and whatnot, it's entirely impossible to ever observe any light emanating from a point in time earlier than about 400,000 years after the Big Bang, because before that point the Universe was nothing but a huge mass of undifferentiated plasma.  Energy hadn't yet decoupled from matter before then, so the Universe was simply a big electron and baryon stew until expansion caused it to spread out enough for energy levels to drop and electrons and protons to combine into electrically-neutral atoms.  That's where the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation comes from, the highly-energetic photons that managed to escape once that happened <span style="text-decoration:underline">without</span> immediately being reabsorbed, only to have their wavelengths expand over the billions of years of spatial expansion until they were the low-powered microwave-level photons they are today.  Which also means logically that for one brief (cosmologically speaking) moment, when the CMBR was instead Cosmic Visible Background Radiation, the entire universe glowed from the remnants of its origins. <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/lol.png" title="Laughing out loud" alt="Laughing out loud" class="smiley-content"/></p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>Calmar</em> wrote:</div>Maybe we should assume that habitable areas in the inner planes are just as rare as habitable areas in our universe. If I'm not mistaken, there's supposed to be an infinite number of habitable planets in reality... somewhere. Since fantasy worlds furthermore enjoy a wider range of sentient species than our planet, anyway, even one (merely Earth-sized) important elemental habitable-planet-equivalent with lots of interplanar contact could very well form the populated "center" of it's plane - the evenly distributed population of the rest of the plane just isn't important, and possibly unknown, too.</div></p>

<p>Oh wow, I didn't even think of that.  Have habitable regions in the Inner Planes be analogous to habitable planets, and the intermediary uninhabited space analogous to interplanetary vacuum.  That idea works so well in hindsight, I can't believe it didn't occur to me before, and I'm kind of jealous it didn't. <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/tongue.png" title="Sticking out tongue" alt="Sticking out tongue" class="smiley-content"/></p>

<p>That's another awesome alternate explanation, though I think it's the sort of explanation that could work well alongside one of the other given formulations too.  I don't see any reason why that couldn't fit in with some of the other ideas here, and I might grab that idea myself.  Even thematically that could give all sorts of great premises for adventures.  Star Trek in Ooze! <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/lol.png" title="Laughing out loud" alt="Laughing out loud" class="smiley-content"/></p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>Archdukechocula</em> wrote:</div>One point I want to make that I think often goes overlooked with this economic challenge to an infinite multiverse is that as long as it still takes a given set of time to exploit an element, there will still be supply and demand.  Given the labor and material costs involved in the exploitation of any good, you can still reasonably expect a market to exist. Even in the real world, we have weird market dynamics wherein incredibly abundant materials like diamonds still have inflated prices because of labor costs (or more strictly the costs of production) and the existence of effective monopolies wherein the supply of goods is tightly controlled. Even with an infinite supply of any given resource, as long as we assume labor is limited (and perhaps that "rarer" minerals are more time consuming to harvest) and a desire for elementals or other creatures seeking to exploit minerals  to serve their own interests, they have reason to control their market tightly and maximize profits (especially when you add in the danger for not natives). If there is a limited supply of labor, the market would still demand various prices based on the difficulties in extracting the raw material. Prices might be reasonably stable, since the conditions of extraction would pretty much remain fixed (although the politics surrounding various enterprises may have some impact), but there would still be a cost. Interestingly, that would mean prices would more closely reflect a labor theory of value ala Marxism, which makes for all sorts of neat political and philosophical conflict.</div></p>

<p>Hmm.  That makes a lot of sense.  You're right on further reflection, and I really like the consequences of that fact too.  All sorts of neat conflict indeed. <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/lol.png" title="Laughing out loud" alt="Laughing out loud" class="smiley-content"/></p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>Archdukechocula</em> wrote:</div>Personally, I find answers to these types of questions that are sort of intrinsic to the mysticism of Planescape to be much less compelling than the questions. Planescape defies the physics of our reality, and much of it is designed to present players with Big Questions rather than merely technical obstacles, so it's difficult to justify the strict application of our own understanding of physical reality (or metaphysical reality for that matter). You can always posit solutions to these questions certainly. (Another possible answer to your question is that the planes have an infinite surface with a finite space ala Gabriel's Horn (which can double as a badass Artifact), which may make it easy for a native to navigate who understands or can perceive the shape of their universe, but no so much for the clueless traveler, and it also ends up a convenient explanation for the fixed travel times and the possibility for infinite wandering if you are going in the wrong direction despite a fixed area). However, I think having an answer to that kind of built in planar paradox ends up robbing it of some of its mystique (much like wanting to stat the lady of pain). </div></p>

<p>(Only cutting off the rest of your response for the sake of space)</p>

<p>I'm not sure about that.  It just feels to me that there's a tremendous difference between mysteries such as the Lady of Pain, and apparent logical contradictions related to how stuff works.  Maybe that's just how I tend to think of things, but personally while I would also hate for any solid answers to be given about mysteries objects within the setting, I still want the mechanisms of the setting to hold together.  I would disagree that you don't get meaningful answers, because I think the interesting ideas that erupt from it <span style="text-decoration:underline">are</span> the meaningful answers.  They let you do something cool or introduce an awesome concept that you'd never have thought of if you didn't ask the question as a DM in the first place.  I wasn't being flippant earlier, I completely and honestly believe that having the planes simply be infinite is entirely boring compared to the alternate explanations we've all presented in this thread, and I think having them work in these methods instead is so much cooler for Planescape <span style="text-decoration:underline">without</span> contradicting what's come before in any meaningful way.  You're certainly right that you don't want to come down on high as a DM and tell them "this is how things work", but!  Having this stuff means that sometimes players can discover an answer to these mysteries through exploration of the setting, which is an awesome experience for them too.</p>

<p>And if they happen to come up with an even cooler explanation you never thought of, you can always make that the explanation instead. <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/lol.png" title="Laughing out loud" alt="Laughing out loud" class="smiley-content"/></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Yes, the positives outweigh the negatives.  Making the planes infinite was done for three primary reasons:<br />
1. Giving them a sense of "mystery" and exoticness<br />
2. Making them more difficult than the prime-- a non-native needs a native guide in order to get anywhere<br />
3. It allows for an infinite amount/number/size of locations to be dropped into the plane without changing its overall landcape at all.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>No offense, but did you even read the rest of the thread, Hyena?  1 and 2 have been addressed over and over so far without resorting to just making the planes infinite; I've even already said twice that I don't find making them infinite to be mysterious or exotic, because there's nothing interesting about aleph-naught.  It's old news, behind the times, passe.  It's barely even a limit ordinal! <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/tongue.png" title="Sticking out tongue" alt="Sticking out tongue" class="smiley-content"/></p>

<p>(Though again, if someone can come up with making a plane of transfinite area beyond aleph-naught in such a way that it's visibly distinguishable within the setting in some way from a plane whose area is merely aleph-naught, I'd probably find that awesome.)</p>

<p>And the third can be dealt with easily by just making the planes really really big.  You could set it to be Ringworld-size, or even Dyson-sphere size if you wanted to get really crazy, and even if every single person on Earth was working on new material for their entire life, a given plane would never be completely filled even with distributing sites far enough apart that they wouldn't even be visible from one another.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>I think there is a fine distinction that lies within this comment. Namely, while I think these questions provide for lots of interesting <span style="font-style:italic">ideas</span>, I think any concrete answer is less interesting. Basically, when it comes to questions about the multiverse, I prefer to leave the answers as matters of perspective rather than clear materialistic explanations. Basically, if you do start positing that the multiverse is bound by a fixed set of rules that can be described, you essentially cede the right of it to the Guvners. Now in our own universe, that kind of thing is no problem, because our universe isn't a setting where belief is power and whose purpose is the fun of the participants. IN essence in our universe, on our planet at least, the Guvner's seem to have the right of it. We've figured out the laws of the universe and have slowly mastered them gaining ever more power int he process. In Planescape however, the very conflicts of the multiverse largely get their fuel from the fact that each perspective is valid in its own right, or perhaps more accurately, no perspective is a conclusive way to view the multiverse based on what any given cutter can actually know. If you posit that the multiverse must follow particular rules for the sake of a particular logical consistency, you've decreed the Guverner's correct in their views as a GM. </p>

<p>To me that basically means any given explanation for something like how the inner planes work should be treated as <span style="font-style:italic">possibly</span> true, with no certainty ever being available because no one really possesses the means to know. Perhaps the Guvner's have the right of it, but given the nature and tech of the setting, they can't really prove it. It still falls in the realm of speculation.</p>

You're certainly right that you don't want to come down on high as a DM and tell them "this is how things work", but!  Having this stuff means that sometimes players can discover an answer to these mysteries through exploration of the setting, which is an awesome experience for them too.</p>

<p>And if they happen to come up with an even cooler explanation you never thought of, you can always make that the explanation instead. <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/lol.png" title="Laughing out loud" alt="Laughing out loud" class="smiley-content"/></div></p>

<p>Well, I halfway agree. Speculative explanations are very interesting and fun and add a lot to planescape. I just don't think definitive explanations are desirable. Really this just comes down to my own particular view of the setting, so if you have a very different perspective on what really gives the setting flavor in your campaigns, many of my points will be much less valid. But if you agree that part of what binds the setting together is the conflicting ideas and philosophies that permeate and even <span style="font-style:italic">shape</span> the multiverse, it is hard to keep that flavor while simultaneously proposing concrete solutions to the questions that make that conflict so vital. </p>

<p>It seems you agree with that assertion somewhat when you suggest a new explanation can overthrow the old, but at the same time I get the hint of a materialistic view of the universe in that thought, in that I think you are of the opinion that superior theoretical explanations with better supporting evidence should overthrow inferior ones, like Einsteinian physics displacing Newtonian physics. That still implies a particular way of seeing is correct, in this case the scientific method.</p>

<p>To get back to the initial point, I can understand your assertion that the idea of infinity is boring to you (it seems largely because your perspective on infinity is strictly mathematical). However, practically speaking, no actual player character will ever be able to establish the difference (really, the same problem exists in reality, where understanding is necessarily limited by the nature of information), so perhaps defining the boundaries of these things is unnecessary in the first place.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Idran: I indeed did not read the rest of it.  However, speaking of that now, I feel that both the TC as well as Ripvanwormer and several other posters in this topic are delving too far into physics, which should NEVER be done in D&amp;D, for two main reasons<br />
1. The mechanics and fluff of 1-3E already defy physics to a ridiculous degree.  Especially the entire Spelljammer setting.<br />
2. Attempting to make D&amp;D adhere to physics will ruin the gameplay and make things overly complicated.  For instance, what are oozes?  What happens when you cast <span style="font-style:italic">Wall of Fire</span> within an enclosed space which doesn't allow the heat to escape?  Will this double the damage and extend the range of damage?  How about the acoustics of a Shatter spell when taking into consideration the terrain, weather (is there cloudcover?), etc.?  Shouldn't practically all materials be reduced to a Hardness of 0 when exposed to the -100+ temps of the Paraelemental Plane of Ice?  What about expansion due to heat and shrinkage due to cold?  <br />
  <br />
Also, I feel, once again, that trying to explain WHY the planes are infinite to non-natives ruins the mystery of the plane.  Not to mention that unless a native and an outsider can practically mind meld, it's not going to be possible for either one to figure out, even if they swapped physical bodies.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Overall I can understand where you're coming from, Archduke, and I think you're right that we're just approaching the problem from different perspectives.  I can appreciate your way of things, I think we just have a different philosophy about it.  (Of course, honestly, I do have to say that from how I see things in the end the Guvners are more right than they could even imagine, though in a way completely contradictory to what they'd like to think.  Unfortunately for them, I just can't picture one of them ever deriving the PHB and DMG. <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/lol.png" title="Laughing out loud" alt="Laughing out loud" class="smiley-content"/> )</p>

<p>((Related side note on that that's just come to mind, I wonder if there is any feasible experiment one could perform to conclude they were existing within an RP-system-based "simulation".  I know it's impossible for simulations in general, but I wonder if that specificity would lead to any general experiments that could definitively conclude "huh, I must live within an RP system of <span style="text-decoration:underline">some</span> sort".  Ruling out freeform systems, which are basically indistinguishable from general fictional works from within, and looking over fiction in general is broad in scope enough that I think it would be impossible to discover the fact.  Though maybe genre-type tests a la <span style="font-style:italic">Stranger Than Fiction</span> to at least narrow down the field...))</p>

<p>Oh, though there is one piece of misinterpretation I think you made in reading my post, Archduke.</p>

<p>What I was talking about here was having a game where the <span style="text-decoration:underline">players</span> are trying to discover the truth behind how things work.  And if <span style="text-decoration:underline">they</span> happened to come up with an awesome hypothesis that you liked, you could throw out your own DM plans and replace them with the players' theory, possibly varied in some subtle way so as to not just give them a victory in their analysis straight-out.  I mean, while it's true that <span style="text-decoration:underline">in general</span> it's probably best to keep these things cloaked, I can definitely imagine a game of planar scientists with a group of players that really want to delve into the mysteries to uncover them.  That could be a ton of fun, I think.  And in a case like that, if your players' main goal as a group is to uncover the great mysteries of the universe their game is in, why deny them?  Don't let them succeed for all of them, of course; it's just like any plot, some obstacles shouldn't be overcome.  But let them discover the true answer to a mystery now and again.  Even if it's only an answer that applies to your specific instantiation of the setting in that game. <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/lol.png" title="Laughing out loud" alt="Laughing out loud" class="smiley-content"/></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>As I said, I don't see how this could possibly work unless you had a spell that temporarily made the target a native of the plane, which might have some game-breaking effects.  Actually, I'm quite certain it would have game-breaking effects, since it would basically render you immune to any and all planar traits, effects, etc., even those otherwise impossible to protect against if one is not native, such as True Cold zones on Paraelemental Ice.  It'd also be broken in that it would allow the recipient to craft magic items that only a native of specific planes can create.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>By ignoring canon and letting them discover the facts without needing to be a native.  Because it's obviously not actually necessary.  <span style="text-decoration:underline">We</span> aren't natives of the plane, are you saying <span style="text-decoration:underline">we</span> don't understand what's going on in the setting?

<p>(Okay, so this part's a little more facetious than my other arguments, but I think it's still logically sound. <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/lol.png" title="Laughing out loud" alt="Laughing out loud" class="smiley-content"/>)</p>

<p>And as a less silly response, let me give you an example.  In my current game, at one point my party decided "hey, we want to discover the true purpose of the Tower of Ice".  They went there, and after some trials, they did!  Are you saying that was a bad move?  And if so, why?  And what would you have done in your game if your players decided that's what they wanted to do?</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><span style="font-style:italic">And as a less silly response, let me give you an example. In my current game, at one point my party decided "hey, we want to discover the true purpose of the Tower of Ice". They went there, and after some trials, they did! Are you saying that was a bad move? And if so, why? And what would you have done in your game if your players decided that's what they wanted to do?</span></p>

<p>I don't think that's a bad move at all.  Didn't we come to the unanimous conclusion in a previous topic that ythe four towers were built by a now either defunct or secretive anti-Doomguard group?<br />
I fail to see how this in any way uncovers the "greater purpose of the multiverse".  It's just an archaology/detective/history delve.<br />
I guess it's just my personal preference that the way in which only natives can find their way across the Inner Planes be left mysterious.  Or at the very least, let's not involve real-world physics in it.  </p>

<p>The reason why it only takes 4 days or so to traverse an elemental plane with a native guide is this and this only: <span style="font-weight:bold">playability.</span><br />
Guides are supposed to be really expensive, and are probably going to want payment based on days' worth of labor.  This is likely to place their price at a total of 4000gp worth of payment, minimum.  For a quest-based price, that's pretty damn expensive.  500 if the guide doesn't know the value of his work.  At d100 days, the price would be utterly ridiculous.  That's of course in addition to the price of all those magic items the party would need simply to survive on the plane.<br />
In comparison, I think most fiends on the lower planes only require bribes between 500-1000gp-- still ridiculously expensive for a quest price, but far more managable.</p>

<p>It's the EXACT same reason why they came up with a fictional set of physics for the Spelljammer world-- sure, they could model it after real-life physics, but the setting wouldn't be very playable, would it?<br />
You wanna make a System Shock roll every time your jammer gets depressurized due to a hull breach?  Or how about that someone floating in space (forget the fact that they'll need an airtight space suit/homunculus suit just to survive) won't be able to cast any spells requiring verbal components, and that the somatic spell failure rate in the zero-gravity environment will be at least doubled.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Fair enough for that, I think we're just in the same situation as me and Archdukechocula.  I can at least see more where you're coming from now, though I do have to say that it's not real-world physics I want to apply so much as logical consistency; it really strains my verisimilitude in any setting to not have that.

<p>Wait, Teleport requires the Astral, doesn't it?  Huh.  I just realized that.  Okay, in that case it's more understandable, since you literally have no easy methods to jump across the plane.  Unless I'm forgetting Teleport-alternatives that don't use the Astral. (And that also renders some of my first-post arguments moot.) Though I'd still say I'd more expect to see a price breakdown something like from 50 gp to the massively-inhabited planes (Air, Water), up to 500 gp for the nearly-uninhabited ones (the negative quasis).</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Well, I could have sworn reading somewhere that a guide on the inner planes will usually demand a payment equivalent (e.g. if it's barter, then the item is worth that much) at least 1000 GP, or 1000GP on the mark.  </p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Wait, Teleport requires the Astral, doesn't it?</span><br />
Depends on whether you're using 2E or 3E rules.  In 3E all the planes are coterminous with the Astral, and practically all Teleportation subtype spells require the Astral, while the Ethereal is demoted to merely being the plane where you have to go in order to defeat certain monsters (e.g. the Dharculus), and there's no Deep Ethereal, anymore.<br />
In 2E, the list was mostly restricted to stuff like Join with Astral Traveler and such (I think there were only about 10 spells each that tapped into the Astral or Ethereal.  All dealt with either traveling to the transitive plane and usually had <br />
Astral" or "Ethereal" in their name, or dealt with pocket demiplanes, such as Leomund's Secret Chest.  The rules in 3x are actually quite ridiculous since IIRC all Teleportation-subtype spells could only be cast on Astral-coterminous planes, and atl least SOME Force spells *particularly Magic Missile* could only be cast on Ethereal-coterminous planes.  No, I'm not joking, here.)</p>

<p>Also, even if you use the 2E planar rules, Teleport only takes you about, what 5000 feet?  Also, in order to teleport somewhere, you'd need a Gate Compass from Planar Handbook, and those things cost 2,500gp to make, and don't always work (if you want one that's failsafe, you'll ned a greater Gate Compass).  Unfortunately, you have to be able to envision/picture the location in your mind.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Part of the issue of Planescape is that the setting itself represents a large logical inconsistency, in that all the faction philosophies are treated as being more or less equally valid. Logically speaking, the viewpoints of various factions should be mutually exclusive (unless you embrace paraconsistent logic anyway). Planescape sort of halfheartedly resolves this with the hand waving explanation of "belief shapes the multiverse", which does manage to explain why competing philosophies can all seem to "work" in some fashion or another. <br />
I think trying to reconcile the inherently logical contradictions of the setting is impossible without denying the very essence of Planescape, that being the clash of ideas wherein no idea is given special preference. </p>

<p>You seem to expect that the inner planes conforms to some sort of law that we can both understand as humans and apply consistently as gamers, as opposed to them simply having an entirely inscrutable system by which they operates, only some of which can be divined by virtue of the limitations of those traveling the plane. It would be like us being aware that things fall when you drop them, but not being aware of gravity as a force. Personally, I think both are equally valid perspectives, and I don't see why either would have any particular impact upon verisimilitude. After all, people told plenty of great stories long before there was a clear understanding of how things worked on our planet. In fact, lots of really great engaging stories originated out of misunderstanding! <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/smile.png" title="Smiling" alt="Smiling" class="smiley-content"/></p>

<p>On a side note I find your comment about the Guvner's being "more right than they could possible imagine" to be amusingly meta. I assume you mean to suggest that the Planescape world actually works according to the rules used by the gaming group, and thus the multiverse conforms to a fixed set of rules. Of course, it means the Signers are right too. After all, nothing in Planescape exists unless we imagine it into existence <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/wink.png" title="Eye-wink" alt="Eye-wink" class="smiley-content"/> </p>

<p>Anyway, this has been a real interesting discussion. Just wanted to bring up those few final points.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>What I can state conclusively is that if the designers had actually gotten to it, I can almost guarantee you that they would go with a combination of *some versions of* Hinduism's idea of creation cycles (e.g. world is created and destroyed an infinite number of times, always has existed, and always will exist, and there will be no "perfect" creation cycle) as opposed to the Norse and Abrahamic versions (e.g. universe goes through 3 creation cycles-- primordial/pristine, then flawed, and then finally redeemed/perfect, with the third cycle lasting for the rest of eternity) or even the Buddhist version (universe goes though a set number of creation cycles before the Maitreya/Miroku/Buddhist Messhiah comes and leads all beings to enlightenment, forever breaking Samsara-- the endless cycle of death and rebirth-- in the final creation cycle, all beings will achieve Nirvana), combined with Eternal Recurrence.  </p>

<p>In other words, the multiverse goes though endless creation and entropy/destruction cycles, and the process repeats (but unlike eternal recurrence, the events are not the same every time.  Just that the overall cycle is the same.)<br />
This version is far more INERESTING than the multiverse ending in an eternal, redeemed/perfect creation cycle.  </p>

<p>Now, the details of what "creation cycle" entails are somewhat up in the air, but IMO it entails that prettymuch everything save one or two races (capable of surviving in void such as draeden) and a handfull of powers were destroyed at the end of the previous creation cycle.<br />
Prettymuch the only way to reach a different creation cycle would be by Chronomancing, so it's not like this information would ever be available to the players barring that can of worms of a campaign setting.<br />
The draeden are actually, probably a race from near the tail end of the previous creation cycle.  </p>

<p>How the multiverse ends this time should never be elaborated-- it should remain mysterious.  Some groups claim that the Far Realm will muck it up, others claim the Draeden will get their way, and the Illithids claim that cosmic and elemental entropy will do the multiverse in.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>That's easy to explain.  In the beginning, there was only the Ethereal, an endless void, and the Draeden (sentient, Cthulu-like beings left over from the destruction of the previous creation cycle/multiverse)  Ethereal (potential) births the Elemental Planes (matter and energy) and the Astral (belief)  At this point, only the draeden and, to a degree, the Ethereal are there to shape belief.  <br />
Belief acquires sentience to form the first powers of the multiverse.</p>

<p>Short answer: belief, like everything else, was originally spawned by protomatter from the Ethereal.<br />
What spawned the Ethereal?  Who knows.  In all likelihood, it was always there.  After all, the Ethereal Plane IS possibility and potential.<br />
The pious who come to this realization are likely to practice a planar form of Gaiaism, worshipping the Ethereal itself as the great creator and the source of all potential and possibility.<br />
Others are likely to worship Ptah for whatever reason (some viewing Ptah of course as a manifestation of the Ethereal's will or power)</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>That still pushes the problem back to the creation of the Ethereal and the Draeden themselves without providing an explanatory framework. It really is no different from the basic problem of Creationism. You offer up an "origin" without really explaining the origin of stuff. At some point you have to say "well, something or other apparently created itself, or always was, and that created belief", which then causes me to ask, why isn't everything just like that stuff? Why don't things just exist of their own accord? Apparently the primordial stuff can exist without any need for the invocation of belief as a generative force, and it itself can create the building blocks of existence, so why introduce this unnecessary secondary creative force called "belief"? </p>

<p>Also, it is hard to imagine why the Draeden wouldn't have created a universe that was entirely self serving, if in fact they were the sole arbiters of creation. And also it becomes difficult to imagine how competing beliefs reconcile, and to what degree "belief" as a thing impacts the multiverse. Is it boundless? Does it work in units? IS it a substance? Can my belief overpower another persons? Do certain beings beliefs outweigh others, or is belief a product of pure numbers? Why do beliefs or the product of beliefs even interact in an infinite multiverse? Do beliefs have a range of interaction? How do beliefs interact with each other? What if my belief explicitly denies the possibility of another belief? Say I believe no other beliefs exist. This belief is logically incompatible with a universe that contains belief, but apparently has equal ability to shape the multiverse. Can logically contradictory beliefs "exist"? Does belief exist in and of itself, or is it a product of a mind? If it is a product of a mind, is a mind able to think independent of the rules of reality? Does thought spring from nowhere, in which case it is hard to explain thought as being anything other than purely random, and consequently all product of belief is without meaning or purpose? Or is it subject to physical or some other law (in which case thought is ordered and not really the product of free will)? If it is subject to physical law, isn't "belief" then really just a byproduct of physical law, and thus a meaningless descriptor as a creative force? If belief can shape reality, and reality can obviously shape belief, how can I determine the causal relationship and truly establish that it is belief shaping anything as opposed to simply reality acting upon reality? Is a distinction between belief and reality even necessary? Are some beliefs more true than others? Does belief conform to rules? What defines the boundary of a belief? Would it benefit me to believe more things than another person? If belief shapes reality, why does anyone believe anything that isn't self serving? Wouldn't most people opt to believe in a universe that served their needs? Why is there suffering in a world where sufficient belief could relieve the world of it? If belief is numerically orientated, why don't the infinite tanarii simply believe themselves to victory? If it is not numerically orientated, why aren't all possible beliefs equally represented? If beliefs are equal, shouldn't every positive belief be negated by its opposite?</p>

<p>It just goes on and on. Really it is just relativism taken to an extreme. Now, all these problems I point out can and do make for interesting stories, but you can't really provide an answer that doesn't just create yet more problems when you follow them to their logical conclusion. It is not a satisfying explanation, because it creates more questions than it answers. </p>

<p>Now, I find it perfectly acceptable to say "well belief just <span style="font-style:italic">does</span> shape the multiverse" without expecting a logical explanation for the mechanism, because any explanation is bound to prove inadequate under inspection.  Basically, I prefer to think that belief shapes the multiverse, and it seems to vaguely conform to a set of rules, but that actual understanding of such a mechanism is impossible by its very nature. That is, you can't hope to understand something so rife with contradiction, perhaps because it is simply beyond true comprehension of any mortal.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>Archdukechocula</em> wrote:</div>Apparently the primordial stuff can exist without any need for the invocation of belief as a generative force, and it itself can create the building blocks of existence, so why introduce this unnecessary secondary creative force called "belief"?</div></p>

<p>I think you're linking together two different things. Belief, broadly, is a <span style="font-style:italic">shaping</span> force, not a creative force. Although some (or possibly all) gods seem to have sprang from belief, the multiverse itself isn't said to have originated that way. Belief is power, so it's thought that enough of it can transform an essentially chaotic multiverse (as the Xaositects believe) into an essentially lawful one (as the Fraternity of Order would have it), or a multiverse based primarily on magic (as the Incantifers believe) into one based primarily on financial transactions (as with the Merkhant ethos), but it doesn't actually cause the multiverse to come into being. </p>

<p>By (extremely rough) analogy, imagine if you'd said, "If the Big Bang can generate the building blocks of existence, why introduce this unnecessary secondary creative force called gravity?" Gravity shapes galaxies and planets, but it's thought to have emerged later in the cosmology after the primal unified force separated into the different forces known today. While no one doubts that gravity exists and plays a role in shaping the universe, no one's claiming it's responsible for the creation of everything. That doesn't make it "half-hearted" to discuss gravity and its cosmological role. </p>

<p>The role of belief in Planescape is, I think, similar. While the war for the dominance of one belief system over the other is fundamental to the play of factions, sects, and planar entities (including the struggle between the tanar'ri and baatezu to determine the nature of evil) and is the heart of the Planescape campaign setting, I don't think any source ever claims that the multiverse itself came into existence because someone believed it into being. That would indeed result in a problem like the one you cite, because where did the first believer come from? But I don't think that's the case. </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Also, it is hard to imagine why the Draeden wouldn't have created a universe that was entirely self serving, if in fact they were the sole arbiters of creation. </div></p>

<p>The draedens didn't create anything. They were creatures of the void, and desired only void. The creators came along later. The draedens warred against them and lost, so most of them went to sleep, to wait until there wasn't anything but void any more.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>And also it becomes difficult to imagine how competing beliefs reconcile</div></p>

<p>That's deliberately ambiguous, as it should be. I think what you mean by this is you're asking, for example, if the Guvners think the multiverse is orderly and the Xaositects think it's chaotic, what is it really? And the answer is maybe that it has traits of both, because neither faction has "won." And that is difficult to imagine, and yes, I agree with you with your basic point that this means Planescape isn't necessarily as self-consistent as Idran maybe wants it to be. The Guvners imagine a multiverse that's fundamentally logical and self-consistent, as Idran imagines, but the Xaositects and Bleak Cabal imagine a multiverse that might be fundamentally arbitrary and paradoxical, with no consistent laws or logic behind them. And the truth is, perhaps, somewhere in between.</p>

<p>And I'm going to contradict myself somewhat on this point further down. Really, the Xaositects don't think they're making the multiverse more chaotic through their beliefs. They think the multiverse <span style="font-style:italic">is</span> chaotic, and their belief in this fact gives them power. But the multiverse would be chaotic regardless of what they think, and regardless of whether or not they have power or not. They freely admit that the Guvners' beliefs bring them power as well, but they're still wrong.</p>

<p>And perhaps they're right. Maybe the multiverse really is arbitrary and paradoxical, no matter how much the Fraternity of Order wishes it wasn't the case. Belief is powerful, but it's not at all clear it can completely reshape reality.</p>

<p>For my part, I didn't really advance a theory of what distance "really" was in the Inner Planes as just describe how it works according to <span style="font-style:italic">The Inner Planes</span> supplement. One amendment to my speculations above that I would make is that I failed to account for the power of fate, destiny, chance, and coincidence in a fantastic multiverse. With that in mind, someone probably could stumble upon elemental beings or an entirely settlement, apparently randomly, even in an infinite plane, even without the aid of an elemental guide or <span style="font-style:italic">beacon seed</span>. It'd be impossible if you were assuming mathematical odds were the only forces at work, but they aren't. Destiny is in play.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Does it work in units?</div></p>

<p>Well, there are "belief points" in the <span style="font-style:italic">Planewalker's Handbook</span>, so yes. At least in a metagame way. </p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">The Primal Order</span> game, designed by Wizards of the Coast founder Peter Adkinson as the company's first product, postulated that gods gain power from "primal energy" that can be produced both by the belief of worshipers and by the planes themselves. Each worshiper produces one point of primal flux per day, as I recall. The game was big on spreadsheets (gods get a number of flux points determined by their number of worshipers and the number of planes under their control). In that setting, primal energy would be the first force in the multiverse, and belief is only one aspect of it.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>IS it a substance?</div></p>

<p>I think of it as the substance the Outer Planes are made of. Note that the multiverse as a whole probably predates the Outer Planes. In its rawest form, there are the "thought winds" and ectoplasmic mists of the Astral Plane. Eventually, over eons, these collect to become "astral dominions" or Outer Planes. </p>

<p>The question is whether or not belief is the same as the substance that makes up souls. It could be that "spirit" is merely a substance extremely vulnerable to the power of popular opinion. If that's the case, the Outer Planes are probably made from both belief and spirit-matter that has been shaped by belief after migrating to the Outer Planes.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Can my belief overpower another persons?</div></p>

<p>I imagine this is illustrated most vividly when a cleric turns or commands undead, or when two anarchs in Limbo attempt to create terrain directly at odds with one another's intentions. </p>

<p>Normally the relevant variables to determine whose belief is "better" would be wisdom (force of will, essentially mental endurance) or charisma (force of personality, or mental strength), though character level (representing belief honed by experience and hard work, as opposed to the relatively naive, untested and ignorant belief of low-level characters) is also an important factor. </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Why do beliefs or the product of beliefs even interact in an infinite multiverse? Do beliefs have a range of interaction?</div></p>

<p>Note that there's no true distance in the Astral Plane, so any belief that collects there needs a range of only zero. Still, there's a form of conceptual distance even in the Outer Planes, inherent in the nature of specific beliefs, and ideas that are conceptually distant from one another (for example, vice and virtue) are located a long ways apart.</p>

<p>On other planes, like the elemental planes or the Prime, it's much less clear if belief can truly transform the nature of reality, how much belief it would take, or if reality would be changed everywhere or only locally. The subjective gravity of some inner planes is sometimes cited as a result of the power of belief, although if one person's down is another person's up, this remains true only for that individual. It seems to be impossible, in the inner planes, for any number of people to force an individual to accept their own interpretation of what "up" is, and in this respect it seems that belief is <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> power in the Inner Planes.</p>

<p>That's not going to stop anyone from trying, however. And who's to say? But the possibility remains so theoretical you don't really need to come up with a concrete answer.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Say I believe no other beliefs exist. </div></p>

<p>Ha! I originally read this as "Say I believe no beliefs exist." That is, "My opinion is that I have no opinion about anything, and neither do you. I have a very strong opinion about this opinion that I don't have." The power of stupid people in large numbers should never be underestimated, so I'd say this is possible, though unlikely. The more people believed that they didn't believe what they were believing, or anything else, the more it would be true (perhaps). They would come to believe things less and less, and eventually their opinion would cease to matter. </p>

<p>Or, alternately, their opinion never mattered. They would get lots of belief-destroying powers that might give them advantages against rival factions, but it wouldn't change the way the multiverse really worked. The Outer Planes are made of belief, and that'd be true regardless.</p>

<p>As for your actual statement, someone believing that no one has an antithetical belief system, this really isn't different from someone believing their belief system is the only right one, and it has the same resolution. The belief has power relative to the proportion of sapient souls who believe in it, and the relative power of their belief (factoring in experience level, charisma, wisdom and so forth, although on average this won't make enough difference to worry about). If everyone in the multiverse believed in a single philosophy, and believed no other philosophies existed, they would be right (obviously). This is the goal of the Harmonium.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Does belief exist in and of itself, or is it a product of a mind?</div></p>

<p>I'd say both are true. It's produced by minds (more properly, souls) and it also exists independently in the form of the substance of the Outer Planes. Belief may well have existed before there were any minds, just raw Law, Chaos, Good, and Evil whispering at the edges of the Astral Plane in the beginning of all things.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div> If it is a product of a mind, is a mind able to think independent of the rules of reality?</div></p>

<p>Are you asking if minds are able to imagine impossible things, or are you asking if they're able to think in situations where thinking is impossible? To the former question I'd say yes, but to the latter question I'd say no.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div> Does thought spring from nowhere, in which case it is hard to explain thought as being anything other than purely random, and consequently all product of belief is without meaning or purpose?</div></p>

<p>The Bleak Cabal would probably agree with this, but other factions usually agree that thought has an origin and destiny relevant to their conception of the multiverse. The Godsmen believe it comes from the Source, the Athar believe it comes from the Great Unknown, the Xaositects believe it springs from chaos, and the Dustmen believe it came from True Life in the time before time, before everything died, to give some obvious examples. The Transcendent Order doesn't think about such things, but they <span style="font-style:italic">feel</span> them. Other factions might default to whatever other religious or philosophical structure they follow. </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Or is it subject to physical or some other law (in which case thought is ordered and not really the product of free will)? If it is subject to physical law, isn't "belief" then really just a byproduct of physical law, and thus a meaningless descriptor as a creative force?</div></p>

<p>The Fraternity of Order might agree with you there. As I said above, I don't think belief was ever intended as a multiversal creative force.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Are some beliefs more true than others? </div></p>

<p>Yes. With enough belief, you can take things that were formally less true, and make them more true. For example, if enough people worship a fictitious god, eventually it will become a real god. It's possible there are some things that won't be true regardless of how much people believe they are ("this statement is false.").</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Does belief conform to rules?</div></p>

<p>The Guvners believe it does.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>What defines the boundary of a belief?</div></p>

<p>Belief does. This isn't really as circular as it sounds, since "belief" is usually found in the form of concrete philosophies, not generic appeals to "belief" as an inchoate, hand-wavy something-or-other. That is, people believe in specific things more than they believe in belief itself, and these specific things normally have their own boundaries in accordance with the ideological system they're part of. Like, where does Christianity begin and Judaism end? Most people would agree that it's fundamentally a disagreement about the nature of the Messiah and what salvation requires. And because people believe it, it's true. Some beliefs may have vaguer boundaries than others. That's fine. Some countries have vaguer boundaries than others, too: that doesn't mean the countries aren't real. </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Would it benefit me to believe more things than another person?</div></p>

<p>No.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>If belief shapes reality, why does anyone believe anything that isn't self serving?</div></p>

<p>Most people believe things because they think they're true. Most planar factions are aware that belief shapes reality to some extent: they only have to look at the way gate-towns slide into other planes when their philosophies change to have proof of that, not to mention faction powers. And they're willing to use this as a tool, and they acknowledge that rival factions have power because their beliefs give them power. But they don't believe beliefs have so much power that they alter the fundamental truths of the multiverse. Could you cynically spread a false belief in order to benefit yourself? You could, and they probably believe that's what most of the other factions are doing. But it wouldn't get you closer to the true nature of reality, which is where the real power lies. Living among the souls of the dead in the afterlife gives you the perspective that transitory power is all well and good, but eventually you're probably going to end up a petitioner with no memory, and it'd be good to know what comes after that, because by itself that's a pretty meaningless end to it all. So what's the real point, beyond the petty squabbles of the planes? It's important to know.</p>

<p>Some of the factions are deliberately trying to use belief to manipulate reality: the Harmonium, definitely. They believe that the power of consensus will make the multiverse harmonious. But they believe in a fundamental truth, that harmony is preferable to disharmony, and believe this is true regardless of what other people believe. Most of them just believe things because their beliefs make sense to them. That's why the Dustmen, Ciphers, the Sign of One, and Bleakers don't bother to proselytize. They don't care if anyone agrees with them or not: things are the way they are. The Sign of One believe that belief is power, but only one person's belief. Which is probably one of them.</p>

<p>The obvious question this raises is: if most people don't believe that belief is power, then shouldn't they be mostly right? Wouldn't the power of belief rearrange reality to make itself less powerful... and therefore be less effective in rearranging reality to make itself less powerful? Possibly, but that's a paradox, so it probably doesn't have any real effect. And most planars, at least, do believe belief has <span style="font-style:italic">some</span> power.</p>

<p>The conceit of the setting is that belief matters. The reason for this is that the Outer Planes are made of belief, and therefore malleable by belief. And entities and forces on the Outer Planes can affect other planes of existence: the gods created on the Outer Planes can create and destroy worlds, and philosophies can be as powerful as gods. Even if a philosophy isn't personified in the form of a god, it can have many of a god's powers without that pesky willfulness. And when the tanar'ri win a victory in the Blood War, every being with a soul becomes that much more chaotic than it was before. Every time an angel is corrupted, every being with a soul becomes that much less virtuous. Every time a fiend is reformed or a gate-town is dragged out of the Lower Planes, everyone becomes slightly less evil. That's why the Outer Planes matter, and one of the reasons why belief is power. Belief can change the Outer Planes, but the Outer Planes can also change belief. The Unity of Rings proves this.</p>

<p>The Dustmen are a powerful force in Sigil because they have a powerful belief. If you ask them, they'd probably say their belief is powerful because it's correct, and other factions may have power because of nature of the planes rewards belief, but nothing they believe will change the fact that everyone is dead and True Death is the only release from suffering. The Xaositects acknowledge that the Guvner belief in laws gives them power, like the axioms and loopholes they exploit, but their beliefs don't change the fact that laws are ultimately arbitrary manifestations of chaos. And so it goes.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Why is there suffering in a world where sufficient belief could relieve the world of it?</div></p>

<p>The problem of pain is the core justification for most of the factions, which is probably why the Lady of Pain is the setting's symbol. Each faction has a different answer to the question, and each faction really exists for the sake of answering that question.</p>

<p>The Bleak Cabal has decided that there's no reason for there to be suffering, and the only "solution," such as it is, is to embrace that fact, accept the meaninglessness of existence, and help people where you can. This doesn't mean there won't be any suffering, but they can reduce it a little both through acts of charity and not wasting effort trying to find meaning where there is none. Suffering exists, and there's no rhyme or reason behind it. </p>

<p>The Dustmen has decided that suffering exists because Creation has fallen into death, and the solution is to learn to see beyond the illusion of life.</p>

<p>The Harmonium absolutely believes that sufficient belief could relieve the worlds of suffering, so their goal is to make sure everyone believes the proper and sufficient things.</p>

<p>The Ciphers believe suffering can be avoided if thought can be eliminated.</p>

<p>The Doomguard believe suffering is part of the multiverse, and suffering will end when the multiverse does. Some of them believe, therefore, they should speed up the end of the multiverse, while others believe that would only increase suffering.</p>

<p>If someone, perhaps a Hardhead, were going to try to convince a Bleaker that they could eliminate suffering entirely if they only believed in the right things, the Bleaker would probably gently try to convince the Hardhead she was terribly, tragically wrong. Belief is power, sure, but ultimately meaningless, as all things are.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div> If belief is numerically orientated, why don't the infinite tanarii simply believe themselves to victory?</div></p>

<p>They're trying! I don't agree that the number of tanar'ri is truly infinite, however. The tanar'ri are a manifestation of belief, so they and their beliefs are only as powerful as the belief in chaotic evil across the multiverse. So they seek to spread belief in chaotic evil by tempting mortals into their path and simply making the multiverse as chaotic and evil as they can. Every time they wreak destruction and woe, they get stronger. Every time they physically steal part of the landscape of the Outer Planes and drag it into the Abyss, they get stronger, because the landscape is made of the beliefs of millions of souls, alive and dead. </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div> If it is not numerically orientated, why aren't all possible beliefs equally represented? If beliefs are equal, shouldn't every positive belief be negated by its opposite?</div></p>

<p>Some beliefs are more convincing than others and therefore more successful than others. The personifications of the alignments work very hard to try to make the philosophies they represent seem more convincing. The celestials work to be inspirations, while the fiends work to be inspirations too, in their own way.</p>

<p>The only reason not to think that beliefs are numerically oriented is the idea that there are more tanar'ri than there are anything else. But they only manifest that way because of the nature of their beliefs, which is chaotic and fractious. The unified, focus belief of the baatezu is just as effective, so their race manifests itself in more limited numbers, as is appropriate for their more systemic and coherent belief system. Probably the eladrins and slaadi are every bit as numerous and fractious as the tanar'ri are.</p>

<p>So it's mostly about numbers, but not entirely. If it was entirely about numbers, then there wouldn't be much point in doing things like dragging gate-towns across planar boundaries, or physically working to slaughter gods, devils, demons, and angels. Those things matter too, because they're powerful manifestations of belief. A single gate-town, or a single god, might be equivalent to tens and thousands of Primes with an opinion about something, because it's a concentrated, potent symbol that's been forged from the beliefs of millions. </p>

         <p><span style="font-style:italic">That still pushes the problem back to the creation of the Ethereal and the Draeden themselves without providing an explanatory framework.</span></p>

<p>No it isn't.  Ethereal = potential and possibility personified.  Potential and possibility is always there, and therefore the Ethereal has always and will always exist.<br />
This is not anything like creationism or the big bang theory (e.g. where did god/the matter in the singularity come from)</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">At some point you have to say "well, something or other apparently created itself</span><br />
No.  Ethereal = possibility.  The POSSIBILITY has always been there, in one form or another, even if it was only a sort of Ethereal singularity or spark (the possibility of possibility, so to speak).  </p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Also, it is hard to imagine why the Draeden wouldn't have created a universe that was entirely self serving[i]<br />
They weren't the sole arbiters of creation, they were the sole arbiters of armageddon (of the previous multiverse).   They already had a multiverse that was self-serving-- primordial nothingness.  </p>

<p>[i]And also it becomes difficult to imagine how competing beliefs reconcile</span><br />
It doesn't even have to be belief.  While Astral is belief personified, that is not ALL it is.  It is also memory.  Beings can also be created from primordial memory on the Astral.  </p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">""And also it becomes difficult to imagine how competing beliefs reconcile""<br />
That's deliberately ambiguous, as it should be.</span><br />
Agreed 100%.  However, if you want to go by the evidence from the inner and outer cosmology itself, the answer is that all belief has an effect, and that the result of all these competing beliefs create an equilibrium and prevent philosophical, cosmic, etc. entropy.  So in other words, every sect and faction has the right idea and the wrong idea about the multiverse, because their beliefs help shape it, but are not the be-all end-all of what shapes or guides the multiverse.<br />
Equilibrium has not always existed; sometimes chaos has been stronger than law and vice-versa, and sometimes fire has been stronger than water, etc.  In the D&amp;D setting however, the multiverse has come to an alignment and elemental equilibrium.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Do certain beings beliefs outweigh others.</span><br />
On the cosmic scale, no.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Belief may well have existed before there were any minds, just raw Law, Chaos, Good, and Evil whispering at the edges of the Astral Plane in the beginning of all things.</span></p>

<p>Actually, no.  Evil and Good <span style="font-weight:bold">as concepts</span> did not exist until some time late into creation (would have been around the time when Yugoloths were created).  The concepts of Law and Chaos came far later than that.<br />
Does that mean that actions and things which we categorize as lawful/orderly, evil, good and chaotic did not exist before those times?  Of course it doesn't. It simply means that among sentient life and thought, the concept of "good vs. evil" or "law vs. chaos" did not exist, just as such concepts do NOT exist in the Far Realm, or among the Draeden, originally.  </p>

<p>[u]Does thought spring from nowhere, in which case it is hard to explain thought as being anything other than purely random, and consequently all product of belief is without meaning or purpose?[/i]<br />
Belief would have first sprang from protomatter and have been entirely under the influence of the Ethereal until the Astral came into being.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>I have to say that, reflecting on things, for the most part I think I can accept most of the conclusions you've made, Rip.  Honestly, the nature of belief itself in Planescape wasn't something I'd thought on much - something I hadn't reached yet in my thoughts on the underpinning nature of the multiverse, I suppose.  But for the most part, implicitly I think I proceeded along assumptions that mostly match the ones you've spelled out there.</p>

<p>But there is one place we differ, and you touched on it a little.  I don't think any of what you've said rules out the idea of a logically consistent setting, even taking into account the beliefs of those within it.  As you mentioned, there are some things that probably could never be believed into existence.  Logical impossibilities.  No matter what, you wouldn't be able to believe "this statement is false" into existence.  You wouldn't be able to believe a square circle, or a system where 2+2=5.  You could believe <span style="text-decoration:underline">redefinitions</span> of the terms "circle" or "5" into existence in order to allow those specific sentences to be true, but not the core concepts I'm intending to express by the statements.</p>

<p>See, the way I see a setting like what the Xaositects and other highly chaos-aligned sorts "winning" would result in wouldn't be something that allows for logical inconsistencies, paradoxes, or other such things.  I think that it would be a system where the "laws" of reality were so malleable that they essentially wouldn't even exist.  A setting where at any single moment there were laws describing the way things worked, but those laws were unstable, and would change easily.  There'd be no way to describe the underpinnings because they would be changing so much.  Reality would be something like one giant game of Calvinball.  But there still wouldn't be anything <span style="text-decoration:underline">logically</span> inconsistent.</p>

<p>I do see that at one point I did refer to things not being self-contradictory, but that was a misspeaking.  I think that the setting can be and in fact is self-inconsistent, as a result of the relative forces of belief pushing against one another, shifting things here and there.  But it's not <span style="text-decoration:underline">logically</span> inconsistent, and I don't think even the power of belief could cause it to be.  The way I see it, logic is a fundamental level that has to exist in all possible configurations of reality, regardless of what belief brings about.  You could say this biases things towards Law, but I see logic, despite Law's claims to it, as something more fundamental than Law vs. Chaos - True and False.  Physics are Lawful, causality is Lawful, but you can have a logical setting independent of both these, or of any other system you might imagine.  Logic isn't Lawful or Chaotic, it just <span style="text-decoration:underline">is</span>.  It's merely <span style="text-decoration:underline">perceived</span> as Lawful (by both the forces of Law <span style="text-decoration:underline">and</span> Chaos) because it's something that can be described by a set of axioms, but one can use logic to describe results hinging on random processes just as well, you just need an alternate form of it.  To say logic is lawful means to say that description itself is lawful, which I think is a tremendously extreme claim to make.  Though I hate to again descend to a meta argument: even Limbo itself has logic to it, or else we wouldn't even be able to use it as a setting.  Even in the heart of Limbo, you can't prove A ^ ~A.</p>

<p>(Also, I didn't expect this thread to spawn such a debate, but I'm really glad it did, it's given me a lot to think about myself. <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/lol.png" title="Laughing out loud" alt="Laughing out loud" class="smiley-content"/>)</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Well, I am not so sure I agree with that assessment. I think this belief thing as shaping force is just a giant problem if you really look closely at it. </p>

<p>Lets do a little thought experiment. Suppose there are six men in the whole multiverse (We can imagine they are the first six sentient being in existence). Also suppose that each of the men are equal in belief, and that the combination of two men's belief is sufficient to produce change. Two men believe there are 3 apples and 3 apples only, and another two men believe there are 4, and two other men think there are 5. In a multiverse with no other believers, If all are equally strong in belief, how many apples exist given these competing beliefs that are all equally possible but mutually exclusive propositions? Only one couple can be right, and if belief shape the multiverse but if the weight of their beliefs are equal, it should seem that no particular answer could be found, after all any one being right causes a contradiction if belief is numerically equal in effect. Whatever the various beliefs floating around, there will be only one result in a case of mutually exclusive propositions.  </p>

<p>Ah, but perhaps they can all be right, because each one's idea of apple is a little different, so each person has their vision of apple created. Problem solved, right?  After all, each person could then manifest their own apples in accordance with their belief, thus reconciling both the requirement of the particular number of apples and their own vision of what constitutes appleness. Perhaps each couple has a slight variation on appleness as compared to the next. But if we accept that belief only manifests change in sufficient quantity, then no manifestation of apple should ever occur, because of minor variations in each persons belief within any particular belief grouping. After all, beyond just the differences in belief concerning number of apples, any couple will have a slightly different notion of what an apple is when conceiving of their belief. </p>

<p>This could be resolved by appealing to a sort of Platonic Ideal of appleness, wherein people get their idea not from their own individual and completely unique experience and makeup, but from some universal form that exists outside the self, perhaps residing in the Astral. But this opens up a new problem, in that there must be an idea for all possible types of apples (after all, each person some how had a different idea of appleness that was still somehow possible), and indeed for all states of apples reflecting all possible ways of thinking about appleness, which perversely just recreates the problem of infinite variation in conception of appleness, such that we are liable to never to have two identical views of apple, and thus never sufficient belief to generate an apple (plenty of people have torn apart Platonic ideals if you are looking for  more eloquent, exhaustive or analytical  takedown). </p>

<p>Now, if appleness is a thing in itself, that is there is an idea of apple that exists true and pure and independent of any physical reality from which all people derive there appleness, then people should not be able to conceive of anything but the same ideal apple. If however apples are a thing in themselves, and the idea of an apple is derived from the experience one has with apples, then each person ideas must be necessarily idiosyncratic (if you need a good example of why this is so, see Wittgenstein's Beetle thought experiment). This being so, belief would be inherently unable to affect change as a product of number, because all belief would be idiosyncratic, and thus no belief would be able to produce a collective result. </p>

<p>Now one possible counter to this view is that all possible variations of a thing exist as an idea. But this solution produces its own conundrum. It is perfectly possible for a person to think that an orange is an apple, until demonstrated otherwise through experience. But if idea itself is derived from archetypal truths, it should not be possible for a person to conceive of an idea that is inherently perverse or which produces a falsity. The notion of an apple being a thing which possesses the characteristics of an orange is not propositionally untrue. It is only untrue in reference to the factual nature of a thing commonly understood to be apples. The only thing that can reasonably be concluded is that the notion of apples is contextual upon common understanding, even though the apple itself must exist regardless of what we decide to call it. There is no reason people should not be able to hold all sorts of beliefs that are contradictory and counter to fact because the origin of their belief need not be conditioned by the fact itself, but which are condition by their own experience which may be counter-factual.  </p>

<p>You may try to argue that variations on belief produce an apple cumulatively that possesses the mixed traits of belief, but then again you create a problem, because that would mean apples would incorporate every wrong impression of an apple, and even contradictory opinions on appleness, until you are liable to have something not much like an apple at all. Further, it would imply the multiverse lumps together unlike things that are categorically inimical to one another simply because of a quirk of language, at which point drawing boundaries on groupings becomes messy if not downright impossible. </p>

<p>If belief is a shaping force in the universe, how can you really resolve this paradox? You can't have belief without ideas, and unless ideas are derived from a single universal source (which I believe is the case via the Astral in D&amp;D), then belief should never be able to be accumulated. If on the other hand belief is derived from a universal source of ideas, then differentiation should prove impossible, or if it is possible, simply should produce the same problem created by idiosyncratic ideas not accumulating to produce a particular outcome.</p>

<p>To further the thought experiment, lets just say that there are in point of fact 4 apples on a particular table, and that those six men all now believed there are 4 apples on that particular table, although they are in another room not looking at the table. Then suppose another man exists in the multiverse with otherwise equivalent properties to any one of these six men. What if he then eats one of those apples? If they still believe there are still 4 apples on that table (and they would have no reason to revise their opinions being ignorant of this act), the action of this one individual just altered the structure of the universe contrary to the belief of everyone else. Does this mean I didn't eat the apple? Is a new apple created on the table, springing forth from the common belief? Are there both 4 and 3 apples on the table? The same problem applies if he attempts to place a fifth apple on the table.</p>

<p>There are at least two discrete possible answers to that dilemma (and a couple more messy answers). If belief shapes reality corresponding to its prevalence, no matter what action this new man takes, there should be 4 apples on the table so long as the belief is retained. There is no reason for that belief not to be retained so long as his eating the apple is known only to him. Thus, nothing done in private that contradicts public belief should be possible, which means any change to physical reality contrary to the popular conception is simply impossible. </p>

<p>If on the other hand eating the apple does reduce the number of apples on the table from 4 to 3, the actions created a situation contrary to popular belief, which suggests belief can't shape reality contrary to the actions of physical reality. But this creates a new problem, because it suggests actions produced in physical reality trump belief. But if this is true, it would seem there are very few actual scenarios in which belief would shape reality, because reality itself is filled with matter in a constant state of action that according to these conditions must take precedent over belief (unless we are to try and imagine an entirely new way of physics in D&amp;D as some sort of solution, but if we try to remain logical then it is hard to imagine consistently applying such a comprehensive overhaul to the very nature of reality). After all, physical interaction with an apple trumps the belief of the multiverse, so it follows that the action of any given atom or molecule or any particle of physical reality trumps the action of belief. </p>

<p>We might again invoke some sort of outside system for resolving this paradox, maybe by saying on the actions of sentient actors trump common belief, but even then, any area outside of sentient interaction (and how do we define the limits of that really?) would be in a state of stasis when no sentient actor involves itself on it. Fires shouldn't spread without an audience. Objects shouldn't fall during an earthquake unless someone is watching them. </p>

<p>A different problem arises when belief reflects things that are not explicitly quantifiable. Any belief in an abstract or an uncountable can't really have this system applied to it. Belief in Red or Shape can't really be settled numerically, since these things are both qualities possessed of things and shaped by the experience of the observer, but yet it is perfectly possible to believe in the existence or lack of existence of subjective experiences and qualities. Is the attribute of quality then in the thing of itself, independent of any particular belief? Is subjective experience shaped by common belief? How do you then translate a quantity of belief into the existence of a particular quality? If I believe in roundness as a quality on its own, independent of a particular object, does the idea count as a discrete unit that requires a fixed set of belief? What are the boundaries for idea in terms of the quantity of belief needed to manifest it? Mustn't roundness exist in the thing itself? If it doesn't, it stands to reason that no objects can ever have stable relationships because the very  nature of the laws shaping them are fluctuating. </p>

<p>In my personal view, you are really just better off not worrying about potential contradictions and paradoxes and instead just living with the rules and accepting that outcomes may occasionally be absurd if probed too deeply. Provide explanations sure, but don't labor under the false that an immediate solution to a particular problem resolves the larger contradictions of the multiverse. I guess my take home point is this. Much like our universe, the multiverse exists, and it seems to have certain rules, but those rules exist in and of themselves and are not contingent upon the understanding of a particular sapient species. They will operate regardless. We as observers may try to understand the rules, but just because we sometimes don't, or believe we observe a contradiction, it doesn't mean we are right. It may even be more sensible to assume you (or the player) are the one who is wrong. After all, the multiverse is going to do its thing regardless of whether or not we agree with it. Unless of course we get enough somebodies to disagree right along with us <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/wink.png" title="Eye-wink" alt="Eye-wink" class="smiley-content"/></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Archduke... what part of the Planescape setting are you arguing with here?  Planescape has as a major theme this conflict of beliefs.  And about different things, those beliefs shape reality to different degrees.</p>

<p>The Inner Planes are very little affected by beliefs.  Personal gravity is about the only belief that will affect them, short of formalized magic or psionics (which might be an application of belief, or might not; it doesn't really matter in general, though in a specific game it might be fun to pin down), and then only some of them.  In particular, "apple" is generally agreed to be a collection of mostly Water, with a bit of Earth and Positive, and touches of Fire and Air, or wu jens would give you a different elemental breakdown which was also correct as far as their standard model goes.  Beliefs don't usually generate material things.  Sigil's factions don't argue about whether there are 3 apples or 4 apples, and most of them speak a common language in which the notion of "apple" is reasonably well-defined by common experience.</p>

<p>They argue about whether the apples exist while no one's looking, whether there is any point to the apples, whether the apples are more dead than something inedible, and who owns them.  Belief shapes these phenomena much more easily than the phenomenon of how many there are in the bowl.</p>

<p>That is, beliefs rarely create but more commonly reshape things, and they typically do so on the macroscopic phenomenological, i.e. they make things happen that are bigger than atomic collisions but smaller than supernovae.  If you were playing with the 2e system of belief points, you could, if you really needed some food, spend 2 or 3 belief points and your GM would suggest that there was probably some food stored in that room over there (your Cipher had a hunch, or your Guvner sensed a pattern in some small clues).  Normally, 3 belief points would do something more like giving you a clue to the plot, about an NPC's motivations, or about the destiny woven around this magical item.  One of them makes a dice roll luckier, or gives you the feeling that you might want to get up before dawn tomorrow and watch the ceremony.  Staring at an empty table and willing an apple to exist might work if you wanted to spend a lot of belief points, but it would be an inefficient expenditure of some very useful energy that your Signer foe is probably going to spend getting his hands on useful NPCs and making the timing of his arrival in the dungeon luckier than yours.  The conflict between your beliefs normally plays out on that level, not the physical.</p>

<p>You pose a lot of questions about the strength and nature of belief, and regard them as unanswerable because more than one answer could fit the given facts, and any possible answer raises more questions.  To the first point, remember that you're playing a game: you get to choose which answer is correct!  The second problem is a feature, not a bug.  Good answers <span style="font-style:italic">do</span> raise more questions.  If they're interesting questions, have a ball exploring them or just philosophize at leisure about them.  If the questions are uninteresting, ignore them.  I get along just fine from day to day even though I have a burning curiosity about the origins of the universe in which I live, which I confidently leave to very smart experts in cosmology to explore professionally.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>That is correct.  The only other thing that could possibly be affected in a major way by belief on the Inner Planes are the powers, but since most of these powers are primordial, it's unlikely that belief affects them in the same way that it affects most on the outer planes (for instance, Kossuth won't die if he lacks worshippers).  Some argue that belief shapes the associations between elements and abstract ideas, though.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>I ran a campaign whose core theme was to resolve what existed independent of belief, and if you could meaningfully investigate such things in a universe where what you observed might well be influenced by what you expect to observe. There were questions as to whether things like the Rule of Threes was fundamental or whether it existed because people believed in it, that sort of thing. The way I handled the paradoxes that might come from conflicting beliefs was two-fold:</p>

<p>Firstly, belief had some inertia to it. If a lot of people strongly believed something for some time, it'd slide into place and be hard to budge, even if the sources suddenly changed. This meant that it was fairly hard to get large local fluctuations, or certain kinds of growing self-reinforcing effects that would cause the multiverse to devolve into nonsense. Generally people had something like one 'point' of belief, which could at best nudge the outcomes of small things. Factioneers could develop bigger pools of belief, and use the leverage of the rest of the factions' beliefs to create more tangible effects. 'Bad things' happened when large amounts of belief were directed towards a person in proportion to their own personal pool.</p>

<p>Secondly, there was a large background stabilizing force to the multiverse due to things that various beings just 'knew' were true and never doubted. It was easy for personal scale belief to create effects that played into this framework (call it basic physics), but extremely hard to go against it too directly. </p>

<p>The background of 'why it was so' was that belief acted sort of like observation on a quantum mechanical system. There was a web of all possible multiverses that could exist,  and belief was the power of things to reinforce themselves. So a multiverse that 'believed in itself' would then generate more belief and would snap into stability. Which multiverse was originally chosen was more or less up to chance, but once it started there was a runaway effect that held things in place. There were basically entities that existed as fluctuations in belief on top of this network, my answer to far realms beings. Focused belief to them was like pinning a worm in place with a needle, so they always tended to be on the edges of knowledge in order to avoid too much belief being directed their way.</p>

<p>So my answer to the 'multiverse with 6 people with equally balanced beliefs' scenario would have been that there are three instantiations of the multiverse, one with 3 apples, one with 4 apples, one with 5 apples, that were all 'equally real' but invisible to eachother. A fluctuation in belief would essentially pick one, at which point the people who believed in the 'wrong' number of apples would see that they were wrong and their beliefs would thus become weaker than those who believed in the 'right' number of apples for that universe. </p>

<p>The PCs eventually began to discover these things when they encountered a material that could store belief, that anyone could use to create limited Signer-like effects. They set up a situation where a powerful Signer used these things to believe into existence a material impermeable to belief, and surrounded a region of space with it, things like that. Also dealt with was the trouble with Electric Monks, when they found a plane where an inventor had created self-replicating artificial life forms that believed him into the status of a very poorly-formed and broken god, what happens when you have a normally uninhabitable world with only ten thousand people on it who are relying on their protector god to sustain life and have a religious schism, and what happens when you simultaneously speak a short phrase into the subconsciousnesses of every living being in the multiverse (which was the campaign-concluding moment as you might guess).</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>Archdukechocula</em> wrote:</div>Lets do a little thought experiment. Suppose there are six men in the whole multiverse (We can imagine they are the first six sentient being in existence). Also suppose that each of the men are equal in belief, and that the combination of two men's belief is sufficient to produce change. Two men believe there are 3 apples and 3 apples only, and another two men believe there are 4, and two other men think there are 5. In a multiverse with no other believers, If all are equally strong in belief, how many apples exist given these competing beliefs that are all equally possible but mutually exclusive propositions?</div></p>

<p>That's exactly why there's more than one outer plane. If mutually exclusive viewpoints always had to be resolved in favor of one of them, there'd only be one outer plane, representing either one of the nine alignments or a hybrid of all of them. Instead, very early in the history of the multiverse there was a situation very much like what you describe, when Law, Chaos, Good, and Evil were all more or less equal powers, existing alone without any other entities around, with fiercely different points of view. The result was four different "bubbles" of reality in the Astral Plane, a plane created in the image of each philosophy. Eventually they blended together along the edges, representing those views neighboring alignments held in common, but the "core" beliefs of each alignment remain adamantly separate to this day. </p>

<p>And yes, each of these philosophies seeks to transform the rest of reality, but they haven't succeeded yet. In that respect, I think your thought-experiment is very apt, but not as problematic as you're making it out to be. Your question is actually  answered adequately in even the official books.</p>

<p>In a practical sense, if a powerful demiurge were actually to create a pocket multiverse populated solely by six people who believe fervently in apples (or the color red, or roundness, or the relative competency of vocalists on a game show), I think you'd get a similar result.</p>

<p>Color and roundness can both be expressed numerically. All shapes can be defined mathematically, independent of any objects. The study of this is known as geometry. Color frequencies and wavelengths can be measured in terahertz and nanometers - this would be more difficult in a medieval setting, but it <span style="font-style:italic">can</span> be done, if our hypothetical universe-creating demiurge really wanted to test that part of the experiment. Medieval fantasy might even make the experiment work better, because the demiurge could ensure that each contestant had cone cells in their retinas of equal sensitivity, and use telepathy to ensure each had the same conception of what colors looked like before testing to see if equally-powered believers could change the nature of color through warring contradictory beliefs. </p>

<p>In my personal view, while the paradoxes and ideas  you're discussing are very interesting and I'll be happy to discuss it more if my explanations aren't adequate, the power of belief in the Planescape multiverse as described doesn't seem to work according to some of the assumptions that make the ideas so problematic for you.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>Hyena of Ice</em> wrote:</div>No it isn't.  Ethereal = potential and possibility personified.  Potential and possibility is always there, and therefore the Ethereal has always and will always exist.
This is not anything like creationism or the big bang theory (e.g. where did god/the matter in the singularity come from)</div></p>

<p>I'm intrigued by this, and want to talk about it, so please bear with me if I over-narrate.</p>

<p>There are basically three kinds of cosmologies: steady state (always there, no beginning or end), linear (both an ultimate beginning and a final ending), and cyclical (a definite beginning and ending, but each beginning was preceded by an earlier ending, and each end makes way for a new beginning). </p>

<p>It sounds like you're suggesting that the Ethereal Plane itself is a steady state cosmology, while the rest of the planes are cyclical. That is, the Ethereal Plane is continually forming demiplanes that eventually evolve into full inner planes and material planes/crystal spheres. Eventually these other planes age and die, and new planes are born to take their places.</p>

<p>Under what circumstances, in your view, does a plane die? If the Ethereal is the only continuous plane, every other plane must die periodically. If the Ethereal is eternal, there was never a time that wasn't after a still earlier creation cycle... unless you're assuming that there was an infinite amount of time, before any other creation, in which the Ethereal Plane was sterile for an infinite duration, and you're left having to explain what might have fertilized it.</p>

<p>Do planes die of old age, slowly expanding and losing integrity until they crumble? Does the Ethereal itself eat away at their base, devouring the Inner Planes until they're entirely dissolved into the mists, at which point everything else collapses? Do the other planes all die at once or do they die independently of each other, one Astral dying even as two new transitive planes spring forth as substitutes? Do the draedens periodically wake up and wreck everything? Were there always draedens, or did some previous cycles have alternative arbiters of Armageddon? </p>

<p>My own view of multiversal history has the Far Realm as a steady-state universe, and Time (which contains the potential for the Great Wheel cosmology within it) possibly budding off it as a waste product from some unfathomably vast Far Realm creature. There's room for epochs where even potential dies, leaving nothing at all. There's also room for cycles, but there may have been a first cycle, and there may yet be a last cycle. </p>

<p>I think it's possible that the Astral and Ethereal actually had separate origins, but at some point they collided and stuck together, like ancient one-celled organisms made by multiple more primitive organisms joining in permanent partnership.</p>

<p>I think a crystal sphere is created when a demiplane is exposed to the energies of the Astral plane, pulling it across the planar boundary into the phlogiston, which crystallizes, forming a solid bubble of crystallized phlogiston due to the energies at work, incidentally protecting the reality within from the phlogiston's chaos. I'm not sure where phlogiston comes from, unless it's a compound of ethereal and astral matter that can't exist within a sphere or on any other plane.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Actually, no.  Evil and Good <span style="font-weight:bold">as concepts</span> did not exist until some time late into creation (would have been around the time when Yugoloths were created).

<p>I would argue that the Astral is not belief and memory personified, but is actually a non-space between the planes in which belief and memory were able to collect. While time does not pass in the Astral, it can only exist within time.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><span style="font-style:italic">And yes, each of these philosophies seeks to transform the rest of reality, but they haven't succeeded yet.</span></p>

<p>Specifically, at the current point in the D&amp;D setting (outside of 4E), the four forces have reached an equilibrium-- all are represented equally, and now it seems that the Multiverse won't budge barring some cataclysmic event.<br />
The exact same holds true for the Inner Planes, as well.  <br />
Nonetheless, we can definitely tell (as discussed in my Law-Chaos war topic) that this has not always been the case with the Inner Planes, because most of the major-setting prime worlds (save Dark Sun) possess natural histories that mimic Earth's.  This means that on a geological scale, these events occured at roughly the same time-- e.g. the last ice age occured at roughly the same time (bet. 8-12k years ago) on most of the prime worlds.  The extinction of the dinosaurs occured at roughly the same time as well, which means it's safe to assume that the Permian-Triassic and the Carboniferous occured at roughly the same time across the prime worlds, as well.<br />
With the exception of the K-T event analogue (which had to be due to a lot more than just wars on the Inner Planes-- I mean Earth + Fire dominance is not going to send bolides raining everywhere) and the Late Devonian extinction events (the latter appears to be related somehow to the rise of vascular plants.  In D&amp;D terms this would likely have been the result of meddling by a primordial plant deity.), the major extinction events would have been the result of a shift in elemental dominance.  E.G. during an ice age, Paraelemental Ice and Elemental Water become dominant, whereas during global warming, Fire becomes dominant.  </p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">If you believe the creation myth in Hellbound: The Blood War, Evil, Good, Law, and Chaos (and possibly Balance as a fifth) all emerged at about the same time, approximately simultaneously.

Prettymuch.  Those concepts existed almost since time immemorial.  The main difference is whether or not those concepts were recognized.  In all likelyhood it was more analogous to the Far Realm-- law, evil, good, etc. exist, even as concepts, but are not recognized by the natives as such.  This is easy to see in Lords of Madness, where the primordial powers that have had extensive contact with the Multiverse offer evil as a clerical domain, while the powers of the Far Realm, with limited contact with Multiverse natives do not-- even if they themselves are very much evil themselves.  This is because while beings of the Far Realm may possess the concept and, in fact, ally with one another based on alignment, the concept of alignment AS A PHILOSOPHY does not exist.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">I think if either axis originated first, it would be the Law-Chaos one, since that doesn't require sentience.</span><br />
I'd have to disagree here.  From what we know of the Law/Chaos war, Good and Evil were already concepts by that time, with the Baernaloths having already created the Yugoloths, and Chan and Sunnis deciding (in Dragon 354) that "law should also be the side of good".  <br />
Also, I would say that law and chaos require sentience every bit as much as good and evil.  This is quite clear if you look at non-sentient and sub-sentient creatures IRL.  The only law that exists here is "might makes right", which sounds more like the Abyss (and like on the Abyss, you can bet that the lessers complain about it, too!)  This is true even of chimps, dolphins, and ravens-- considered to be the smartest animals.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Yes, the yugoloths must have already existed, but their equivalents among the hosts of law and chaos probably came into being at about the same time. I did suggest that yugoloths were older than obyriths, based on the idea that the obyriths (rather than the later tanar'ri, as <span style="font-style:italic">Faces of Evil</span> had said) were what the General of Gehenna created when he cast the chaotic larvae from the yugoloth race. However, I think there were probably chaotic outer planar beings in existence before the obyriths - I think the slaadi were probably older, for example.

<p>Have you ever looked at ants and other social insects? They're definitely organized, and their organization has nothing to do with physical force or might. How about bonobos, which rely on socialization rather than intimidation? Do ducks fly in formation purely because they're intimidated by the might of the alpha duck? They do not; they have an instinctive sense of order. How about symbiotic relationships between species, or the way the vast complex systems in a single organism work together in harmony (probably evolving from multiple symbiotic organisms working together in ancient times)?</p>

<p>Besides which, complaining about order doesn't make it less orderly. Tanar'ri don't have the smooth harmony of a wolf pack hunting in concert; they're a mob of individuals who war against one another even as they attack those they feel mutual hatred for. Wolves, once they've established the pecking order, cooperate with an elegance that can only be called orderly. The criteria they use for choosing their order doesn't make it disorderly; even baatezu generally appoint the mightiest among them to be their leaders.</p>

<p>Cats, now. They're a chaotic species if ever there was one. Even if one establishes dominance, they still don't cooperate (lions excepted). But canines are lawful.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>To be fair, and not to get too far off topic, they don't exactly have an instinctive sense of order.  They simply have a specific but very simple instinctual set of rules on where they should fly relative to other ducks in their immediate vicinity that causes the familiar V formation as emergent behavior when taken over the entire flock.  The flock as a whole isn't aware of the formation, just where the ducks nearest to them happen to be.  There also isn't truly an alpha duck; the lead duck trades out to the back of the formation as the flock flies because the whole reason the V formation evolved was so that the rear ducks could benefit from reduced drag as a result of the formation, but naturally this means the head duck requires much more expenditure of energy, and so they swap not out of choice but out of those simple instinctive rules.  Evolved semi-altruism to allow for the benefit of the flock as a whole, you might say; it doesn't benefit any single duck to swap in as leader, they'd expend less effort staying in the back rank, but without them doing it the flock as a whole would have less chance of survival.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>Hyena of Ice</em> wrote:</div>This is true even of chimps, dolphins, and ravens-- considered to be the smartest animals.</div></p>

<p>All emphasis below mine.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolphin#Behavior" class="bb-url">Dolphins</a>:</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>However, dolphins can establish strong social bonds. <span style="font-weight:bold">Dolphins will stay with injured or ill individuals, even helping them to breathe by bringing them to the surface if needed.</span> This altruism does not appear to be limited to their own species however. The dolphin Moko in New Zealand has been observed guiding a female Pygmy Sperm Whale together with her calf out of shallow water where they had stranded several times. They have also been seen protecting swimmers from sharks by swimming circles around the swimmers or charging the sharks to make them go away.</div></p>

<p>If it was nothing but "might makes right", you wouldn't expect to see any altruistic behavior at all, instead merely leaving the weak or injured individuals to die.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Raven#Behaviour" class="bb-url">Ravens</a>:<br />
<div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>One behavior is recruitment, where juvenile ravens call other ravens to a food bonanza, usually a carcass, with a series of loud yells. In Ravens in Winter, Bernd Heinrich posited that this behavior evolved to allow the juveniles to outnumber the resident adults, thus allowing them to feed on the carcass without being chased away.<br />
...<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Common Ravens have been observed to manipulate others into doing work for them, such as by calling wolves and coyotes to the site of dead animals.</span> The canines open the carcass, making it more accessible to the birds.  They watch where other Common Ravens bury their food and remember the locations of each other's food caches, so they can steal from them. This type of theft occurs so regularly that Common Ravens will fly extra distances from a food source to find better hiding places for food.</div></p>

<p>Not necessarily what might be considered moral behavior by human standards, no, but far more complicated than "might makes right".  More "I'm smarter than you so I don't <span style="text-decoration:underline">have</span> to have might", more LE than CE.</p>

<p>Chimps, though, they're definitely how you describe.  Chimps are mean animals.  But animal behavior, especially among the more intelligent animals, goes far beyond "might makes right".  Other than these, look at the breadth of social interactions amongst the gorillas, the bonobos, the whales.  They show a wide range of types of interactions.</p>

<p>And then there's the octopus, which is at least as intelligent as the raven if not more so.  They use tools, they are aware of their environment and are able to change it to adapt to their needs, they show great problem-solving ability, they even engage in what some have interpreted as play. (Juggling, mostly.  I'm entirely serious, they've been seen in captivity juggling, without having been trained as a trick or performance or something.) And yet they show almost no signs of social behavior outside reproduction, not even "might makes right".</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>ripvanwormer</em> wrote:</div>
That's exactly why there's more than one outer plane. If mutually exclusive viewpoints always had to be resolved in favor of one of them, there'd only be one outer plane, representing either one of the nine alignments or a hybrid of all of them. Instead, very early in the history of the multiverse there was a situation very much like what you describe, when Law, Chaos, Good, and Evil were all more or less equal powers, existing alone without any other entities around, with fiercely different points of view. The result was four different "bubbles" of reality in the Astral Plane, a plane created in the image of each philosophy. Eventually they blended together along the edges, representing those views neighboring alignments held in common, but the "core" beliefs of each alignment remain adamantly separate to this day. </div></p>

<p>Well, I understand the resolution to this problem when it comes to differing views of personal values, which is what separates the various outer planes. It becomes more difficult to explain when you are talking about competing views of the factual state of reality, which your explanation only somewhat addresses. I realize the suggestion is that basically given any competing view of reality, you would expect a plane of existence to spring up to accommodate that view if given sufficient belief (presumably an awful lot, which means it would have to reflect pretty fundamental and/or primal ideas like good and evil). But if you consider that one's belief about the factual state of affairs is entirely personal and based upon your own knowledge and experience, with random overlap with various other people, wouldn't that result in a bunch of demi-planes to accommodate various beliefs, or at least an infinite expanse of transition between particular beliefs rather than hard planar boundaries? Certain places like the outlands sort of serve that function, but ideologically each plane is fairly distinct and there is generally little suggestion of gradient other than the gatetowns, and the gatetowns themselves provide a pretty definitive ideological boundary (I might be persuaded otherwise on that point, as there are some other places where such gradients are suggested, just not as commonly as might otherwise be concluded). </p>

<p>I think the "inertia" idea suggested by NichG (that established realities are very difficult to undo, especially when it comes to certain fundamental rules) is a good partial solution. The infinite possible realities of which any given person occupies one is another good way of getting around the problem because it basically says the irreconcilable situations create parallel dimensions.</p>

<p>Now, the suggestion that new planes (or new parts of existing planes) are just shapes to accommodate competing beliefs seems reasonable enough as a way to resolve things, but then you have to wonder why belief would do anything other than shape otherwise unshaped parts of the multiverse (and why not since the multiverse is infinite?). It would seem sort of contrary to that idea to then say belief can affect pre-existing areas, since it seems to resolve conflict not by choosing one idea over another, but rather by simply taking the path of least resistance and shaping some unshaped area to meet the particular belief. It makes sense that an area might grow the more new belief reinforces the idea, but it is hard to see why belief would be changing areas already established when the path of least resistance would seem to be working with the raw potential of the ethereal, or working with whatever it is that allows belief to shape infinite planar expanses. If the planes were limited in size, then you might have a justification for belief changing pre-existing areas previously shaped. To use an analogy, a lake filled to a certain level might break the banks and flood the valley below. But why would that lake do anything but keep filling up if its basin was of infinite depth? Maybe there is an underlying geography to the planes that directs this belief like the contours of a valley, a geography that has no bearing on the actual physical makeup of the planes? Such an idea though would almost require a new coterminous plane to explain such a thing. </p>

<p>Which leads me back to the apple thing. My point was that there is plenty of reason to have a particular view about the factual state of affairs (such as the number of apples on a table), even though you are often liable to be wrong. After all you can't constantly be aware of every factual change in the multiverse. So it would seem to me that, given the vast possibility for wide variation in views on every day things, the tendency of the multiverse would be towards the average (or possibly modal) explanation, which would make change in that state very difficult, because any change would inherently be contrary to the common average belief, especially since the reality in place initially must conform to that average belief. I sort of get the impression that you are saying that belief really wouldn't impact explicitly factual things at all, and at best might shape stuff in some distant part of an outer plane, but I think for that to be valid you almost have to reject the possibility of change in factual states of affairs via belief, which would have vast repercussions. </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Color and roundness can both be expressed numerically. All shapes can be defined mathematically, independent of any objects. The study of this is known as geometry. </div></p>

<p>Sure. But these are mathematical attempts to explain a property we observe, but there is no such thing as the perfect roundness or ideal redness we can conceive of. We can describe it, but it doesn't exist, partly because the idea is something apart entirely from the reality of the thing the idea derives from. Redness is a property of an object that exists in various degrees, but redness is not a thing in itself. It is an idea that encompasses certain phenomena, but which exists outside the presence of those phenomena in our minds. It would be similarly reductive to treat hate, envy, love and other essentials of the outerplanes to merely the biochemistry that produces them. Redness only exists physically as a property of a thing, specifically light cast off an object. Roundness is a little different in that it is a geometric description to which objects conform to varying degrees, but the issue is fundamentally similar. The wavelength of light is certainly a thing in itself, and it can't be denied that it does certain things in the world (well, it can be denied, but that's a whole different problem), and similarly shapes exist and things conform to various geometries and such objects behave in a certain way. But the experience of these things is also subjective, and our conception of them does not really reflect the reality we face. When we think of redness as an idea or roundness as a shape, our mind is not accurately reflecting our experiences of these things. It does not reflect a particular wavelength or offer up a particular specimen we've experienced that is sort of round. We have a notion of these things that the world somewhat conforms to. Rather we think of abstract objects with idealized properties, or sometimes just a set of rules. </p>

<p>The point is, belief should reflect how we think about things, and thus a realtiy shaped by belief should reflect that sort of thinking. That is contrary to the real world where how we think about things is a reaction to the state of reality. Thus red isn't the way it is because we think it is that way (which would be the Platonic view and seemingly the Planescape view). Obviously you know that, but you don't seem to be address the very serious issue this presents. Basically, if in planescape Redness is a function of wavelengths, that must assume redness was first imagined as being a wavelength rather than a color, since there is nothing in the belief of color that anyone would have that would require wavelengths, and if anything people's beliefs would likely reflect a vastly simpler and less realistic explanation (if you need proof of that, just as 20 people around you how color works). And roundness would first be conceived of as a perfect two dimensional shape rather than a lumpy rock. But the multiverse is filled with lumpy rocks and, apparently by your own admission, wavelengths of light that are perceived as color. Unless those things are preconditional physics of the multiverse, why would that be how things manifest themselves? Shouldn't the outcome of belief conform to the nature of the belief itself? When you get right down to it, if they think color is a certain thing that works in a certain way (which I think you would agree would not likely be wavelengths of light), shouldn't that be how color works?    </p>

<p>I guess what I am getting at is that essentially belief, unlike say gravity, does not follow a fixed set of rules. Gravity is essentially a mathematical explanation for a predictable behavior of matter in the universe. Belief does not really have a similarly fixed property, because its effects are widely variant, highly contingent upon the believer, and essentially subjective, so the idea that it produces a fairly stable universe with a fixed set of rules implies that there are lots and lots of things everyone basically agrees upon that just so happen to create conditions similar enough to our own reality. But that requires that people's explanation of physical reality basically matches closely our own scientific understanding of reality, otherwise we would expect very different rules. Things might fall only if they are dropped by someone or something for example, rather than because bodies with mass attract one another. But given the world they live in, their ideas about things should be radically different from what is now our common understanding of how stuff works, color being just one such example.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

Yes, and I agree with you entirely.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">I wouldn't. It's easy to imagine nonliving matter is an organized or disorganized state.</span><br />
Law and Chaos encompass far more than simply organized vs. disorganized.  For instance, Law requires the contract (be it written, conceptual, etc.) and agreements.  Non-sentient life is unable to make agreements or treaties, and law only exists in so far as it can be forced upon others (might makes right).  Might makes right is inherently non-lawful.  Even the tyrant cannot follow this rule and maintain a lawful alignment (as we see with the Baatezu, for instance).  </p>

<p>Have you ever looked at ants and other social insects? They're definitely organized, and their organization has nothing to do with physical force or might.<br />
Yeah, I forgot about them; hive insects are the exception to the rule, though.</p>

Partly.  Although it's also because (perhaps primarily because) it's easier to ride on the alpha duck's air current.  The Alpha duck doesn't even have to be a duck; it can be a human hangglider or seated glider.</p>

Once the relationship is truly symbiotic, then there is no longer any need for any of the organisms involved to compete any longer, which means that "Might Makes Right" no longer holds any purpose between the symbiotic organisms.  You can see this easily in twin trees, which will, at first compete by twisting around one another in a vicious attempt to grab the most sun.  Once their roots fuse and they become a single organism, this competition (and tree twisting) comes to an end.  You can actually pinpoint where in the trees' growth this fusion takes place.  Once the organisms share their resources, they no longer compete with one another.  That goes for both trees connected by the roots, fungal colonies, colonies of bulbs/strawberry plants, and lichens.</p>

Yeah, but in the case of calling predators over to do their dirty work, both organisms benefit equally from this.  Ravens (unless the nest is attacked) will not mob large animals, so they have to wait until the wolf/etc. is done eating before they get the leftovers.   The predator is called over to an easy meal that it might not otherwise have been able to find.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">They watch where other Common Ravens bury their food and remember the locations of each other's food caches, so they can steal from them.</span><br />
I believe all corvids do this, actually.  I know that our scrub jays get pissed if you watch them bury their food, and they don't even want their own mate to witness the stashing.  Jays are also well known to watch squirrels bury their food, dig it up, then rebury it somewhere else.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Right, but my point is it's not "might makes right", and you can't summarize a raven's interactions with just that single phrase any more than you can for most intelligent (and even in some cases, not so intelligent) animals.  Hive animals aren't the "exception to the rule"; it's simply an overly reductive statement that breaks down when you actually try to apply it to a number of species' general interactions.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>Hyena of Ice</em> wrote:</div>Law and Chaos encompass far more than simply organized vs. disorganized.  For instance, Law requires the contract (be it written, conceptual, etc.) and agreements. </div></p>

<p>It encompasses more than organization versus disorganization, but the idea of organization versus disorganization is certainly sufficient in and of itself as examples of law and chaos. The conflict between organized and disorganized states therefore long precedes the development of sentient or any other kind of life. </p>

<p>So it seems obvious to me that the plane of Minerals is more orderly than the plane of Dust is, simply because it is, as an objective fact. That doesn't mean either plane is lawful-aligned in the sense of the outer planes, but I think the fundamental conflict between organization and entropy is the primitive beginnings from which the outer planar conflicts may have began. </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div> Non-sentient life is unable to make agreements or treaties</div></p>

<p>I wouldn't even agree with that. The relationship between remoras and sharks, for example, constitute an agreement. They might not even be aware of it, but that doesn't mean it's not orderly. This doesn't mean that sharks are lawfully aligned (though the shark-god Sekolah is), only that it's an example of order in nature. The agreement of lower-ranking wolves to follow the directions of the alpha is an agreement. Not a formal one, but a real one with real effects. The fact that it's instinctual doesn't mean it isn't lawful.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Might makes right is inherently non-lawful.</div></p>

<p>And I don't agree with that. There's much more to law than how leaders are chosen, which can be completely arbitrary. A society can be extremely lawful and choose its leaders by random lots, shoe size, or any other criteria. The test is in how stable the society is; other aspects of the society can compensate for poor rulers (a strong bureaucracy, for example, can ensure stability regardless of what the leader does).</p>

<p>Rule by the mightiest is simply another possible way to choose rulers, and a fairly logical one in harsh times. The question isn't how leaders are chosen, but in how their followers behave. Are they inclined to be obedient? Dogs and other canines certainly are. Once it's been established who the alpha is, canines are exceedingly obedient animals. The way a wolf pack takes down a caribou or other animal is remarkably cooperative and orderly.</p>

<p>In the example of the baatezu, you'll pretty much always see that higher-ranking devils will be stronger than lower-ranking ones. Partially this is because baatezu are granted more power every time they're promoted. Partially it's because those who are more successful in the Blood War (displaying might) are more likely to be rewarded with promotion. Baator does have a stable and entrenched bureaucracy (controlled for the most part by the Dark Eight), and its inhabitants are inherently prone to obeying laws and following orders, so the fact that their leaders are chosen for their might doesn't make them more chaotic than if they were chosen through democratic elections, inheritance (Fierana is the only known instance of this), or some other means.</p>

<p>Intelligence is only another form of might, another weapon in a warrior's arsenal. A baatezu proving his fitness to rule through feats of intellect is no more orderly than one proving similar fitness through feats of strength.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Yeah, I forgot about them; hive insects are the exception to the rule, though.</div></p>

<p>Hardly. You can see examples of animal communities working in harmony throughout nature, from prairie dogs to elephants to schools of fish. To dismiss their remarkable cooperative skills as a demonic anarchy is a gross distortion.</p>

<p>Should all animals be given a lawful or chaotic alignment based on how social they are? Perhaps not, but they definitely have tendencies, and human alignment tendencies are only more sophisticated versions of that.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>The Alpha duck doesn't even have to be a duck; it can be a human hangglider or seated glider.</div></p>

<p>Exactly. And the glider doesn't have to repeatedly beat up the ducks to get them to follow, does it? The ducks follow instinctively, not out of brute strength but out of an inherent disposition toward order. The idea that they follow simple rules that results in order sounds lawful to me.</p>

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>Archdukechocula</em> wrote:</div>Well, I understand the resolution to this problem when it comes to differing views of personal values, which is what separates the various outer planes. It becomes more difficult to explain when you are talking about competing views of the factual state of reality, which your explanation only somewhat addresses.</div></p>

<p>There are a few different situations in Planescape where reality in the Outer Planes "splits" based on differing points of view. The oldest and most potent division is obviously based on alignments, which define the Outer Planes more than anything else. After that, you'll see different pantheons coming into existence depending on the cosmology of different cultures. That is, one culture might see Thunder and its associated deities in one light, and one culture might see atmospheric phenomena in a different light, and rather than the multiverse generating a single composite thunder god, there's a different thunder god for each culture. These are subordinate, as far as outer planar organization goes, to the alignments, which might have more influence because they're bigger, more universal, or perhaps simply because they've been around longer.</p>

<p>You bring up other basic natural laws, like geometry, color theory, and gravity. It's true that different cultures organize colors in different ways (the Chinese recognize yellow-orange as a color, but not yellow; there are African cultures that count blue and black as the same color), but it's not immediately clear to me how this would effect the planes or the laws of nature. Insofar as there are gods for these things, each culture has its own. </p>

<p>In situations where the perception of things is truly individual (in color perception, for example), it's easy to imagine each person's belief affecting only themselves. In your thought-experiment with a multiverse containing only six people, if each person has their own opinion on what color something is, that person can continue to have their own opinion without that belief affecting anyone else's. The object simply exists in a subjective, "quantum" state without any "true" nature that can be divined. And I'd say this remains true even if five of our lonely souls see something as purple and one insists it's a vivid neon green. When one's perception affects only oneself, there's no reason to assume reality would be democratically imposed.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>wouldn't that result in a bunch of demi-planes to accommodate various beliefs</div></p>

<p>In the Outer Planes, more likely a bunch of realms. But everyone doesn't need their own realm; as above, it's really only a situation where one's opinion matters, as in a great philosophical movement or religion. So I don't think there needs to be a region in the Outer Planes where everyone thinks spaghetti is awesome slowly fading into a region in which people think spaghetti is merely adequate.</p>

<p>It's also true that most beliefs don't map precisely onto the outer planar landscape because the alignments have such overwhelming priority. So, for example, the Egyptian pantheon is scattered throughout the planes rather than having a single massive realm representing the Egyptian cosmological view, overlapping with neighboring cultures like ancient Kush or Assyria. The conflict between Law, Chaos, and other greater forces has broken that up. The same is often true of any philosophical viewpoint, which usually fail to shape the planar landscape significantly (which is why the Sign of One and Doomguard don't have their own planar realms).</p>

<p>Just about any cohesive philosophy makes for a great idea for an outer planar town, however, and this town can be pulled into one plane or another depending on the influence of Law, Chaos, Good, or Evil inside it.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Certain places like the outlands sort of serve that function, but ideologically each plane is fairly distinct and there is generally little suggestion of gradient other than the gatetowns</div></p>

<p>The Outlands grow more chaotic toward aoXs and more harmonious toward Fortitude, and more wasted toward Hopeless and so on. Closer to the Spire, though, everything becomes more balanced.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>I think the "inertia" idea suggested by NichG (that established realities are very difficult to undo, especially when it comes to certain fundamental rules) is a good partial solution.</div></p>

<p>I think there's some truth to that. Another thing to keep in mind is basically what I've been saying for some time in this thread: that Planescape doesn't really present a multiverse where everything is generated by belief, just one in which belief is very powerful and influential, especially in the Outer Planes. </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>but then you have to wonder why belief would do anything other than shape otherwise unshaped parts of the multiverse</div></p>

<p>I think the answer is that there's a distinction between changing existing beliefs and coming up with entirely new beliefs. Law and Chaos are entirely different beliefs and they can't really change each other, only affect what influence each has on other things. So there are separate planes of Law and Chaos, and an individual town or realm can be pulled toward one or the other. In influencing where a town slides, you're shaping existing beliefs (the existing beliefs of that town's inhabitants and, perhaps, the philosophy that town personifies) rather than creating a completely new philosophy/town that would probably appear in some unshaped part of the Outer Planes, independent of any existing one.</p>

<p>In our hypothetical universe of six, if three people thought that libertarianism was good and three people thought it was evil, the town of Libertarianburg would probably end up somewhere in that universe's equivalent of the Outlands. </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Maybe there is an underlying geography to the planes that directs this belief like the contours of a valley</div></p>

<p>This geography is defined, to a very large extent, by the larger aligned forces. To a lesser extent, powerful pantheons define planar geography. Other than that, the outer planes have no "actual physical makeup." It's all reified belief.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>So it would seem to me that, given the vast possibility for wide variation in views on every day things, the tendency of the multiverse would be towards the average (or possibly modal) explanation</div></p>

<p>Perhaps. For the most part, I don't think belief affects everyday things at all, if only because people rarely have strongly divergent opinions on them. In your apples example, my first instinct was to say the average number, four, would win, but I remembered that there's more than one outer plane, and there's a reason for that.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>I think for that to be valid you almost have to reject the possibility of change in factual states of affairs via belief, which would have vast repercussions. </div></p>

<p>I think the main repercussion is that you'll end up with a Planescape that looks like the published Planescape. As you pointed out earlier, if people believe that anything enough people believe becomes real, why wouldn't they concentrate on dreaming up the best of all possible worlds? The Dustmen believe everyone is dead not because they desperately want this to be the case (although there might be some of that), but because they're convinced it is the case, and that it will always be the case regardless of what anyone thinks. And outside the Outer Planes, the idea that belief is power is much less common.</p>

<p>So if belief <span style="font-style:italic">does</span> affect the fundamental nature of reality, most people don't seem to believe it does. Which is a paradox.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Redness is a property of an object that exists in various degrees, but redness is not a thing in itself.</div></p>

<p>I think colors might actually be things in themselves on the Quasielemental Plane of Radiance. If there are Platonic shapes, they probably exist on Mechanus (and, in "fallen" form, in Acheron; in "ideal" form in Arcadia, and I'm not exactly sure how an idealized shape might be different from a Platonic shape - maybe the corners aren't as sharp). On more chaotic planes, people would be more dubious that shapes are Platonic things and not just imperfect, subjective descriptions of things (and I have a long-delayed reply to Idran on that subject).</p>

<p>Emotions, for their part, seem most real and affecting in Arborea and the Abyss, which seem for whatever reason to personify them. It's likely that in less chaotic planes, emotions are thought of as less objective.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Basically, if in planescape Redness is a function of wavelengths, that must assume redness was first imagined as being a wavelength rather than a color</div></p>

<p>In Planescape, redness is probably a primal schism in the pure light of positive energy, and probably precedes any belief in what redness might be. I'm not convinced that redness is something that can be affected significantly by belief, with the Plane of Radiance continually reminding the multiverse of what redness really is.</p>

<p>The same probably applies to most everyday things, with reality being defined in the Inner Planes and interpreted elsewhere. The symbolic associations of red might be found in the Outer Planes (for example, in red slaadi and red abishai), but I think Planescape does present a "pre-existent reality" that isn't defined (at least, not primarily) or generated by the vagueries of what people believe them to be.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

You wouldn't be able to believe a square circle, or a system where 2+2=5.

<p>And here's where I might suggest a leap of imagination. Can you imagine a fictional universe in which mathematics and logic aren't objective descriptions of the way things are, but only a self-consistent language that presents a possible point of view? </p>

<p>It's certainly possible to see this as true in some cases. For example, in logic, the phrase "All Hardheads are arrogant; Factol Sarin is a Hardhead; therefore Factol Sarin is arrogant" is self-consistent, but not necessarily factual. What if reality itself wasn't self-consistent, but a constantly churning and shifting mass upon which some deluded souls have convinced themselves that consistent rules apply? </p>

<p>In dreams, where objects and assumptions aren't always consistent, you may indeed take two groups of two things and find out you actually have five of them. Somewhere in my files, from a mailing list discussion a long time ago, I more elaborately fleshed out what a reality that behaved according to the rules of dreams might be like, or where mathematics were consistent but different from maths in our own universe. For example, think of the repercussions of a universe in which any time you paired something, you ended up with three of them. Two travelers are distinct individuals until they meet up, at which point there are three travelers, each with their own distinct histories. If you held up two fingers you'd find yourself holding up three fingers, and this process can be repeated infinitely, so anyone could easily hold up hundreds of fingers or more on the same hand. Any time you set down one of your three arms, you'd lose an arm. The idea is impossible for us to fully wrap our heads around because it isn't the way our reality works, but that's what imagination and fiction are for. It'd be an inconsistent, illogical universe, but why can't we have those? </p>

<p>I bring up dreams because who's to say that all reality in the Planescape multiverse isn't a dream? <span style="font-style:italic">A Guide to the Ethereal Plane</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">Doors to the Unknown</span>, and the Ravenloft <span style="font-style:italic">Nightmare Lands</span> boxed set all present a multiverse in which there are multiple levels of reality. There are places in the multiverse so real that we're just dreams to them, just as here are places that are less real, that are dreams to us. But if conventional reality is only someone else's dream, maybe it's only following dream-rules, illogical and governed by associations rather than consistency.</p>

<p>So what if the Xaositects are right, and gravity isn't a consistent law but only something along the lines of a long-term trend, a momentary whirl that could easily reverse itself at any time? What if somewhere on the planes there are Shrodinger's cat people who are both false and true simultaneously, flickering in and out of what the PCs can perceive of as existence?</p>

<p>That would clearly be impossible. And yet, it's fiction, so why not? There's no way that we could present a reality like that in a consistent, sensible manner... but who says reality has to be consistent, sensible, or comprehensible to the players or DM? It might be fun, on occasion, to take a vacation from sense.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>I think that it would be a system where the "laws" of reality were so malleable that they essentially wouldn't even exist. </div></p>

<p>Are they really laws, then, or just guidelines? Does a  government that says "You're encouraged not to murder people, but we can't really stop you if you decide you really want to" have any laws?</p>

<p>I think the Xaositects may be trying to weaken the "laws" of reality in situations where they seem overly restrictive, but more fundamentally they're arguing that the laws of reality are <span style="font-style:italic">already</span> weak and malleable, and most people don't realize it. If they did, like Neo waking up in the Matrix, they'd be able to do a lot more. It's not that belief is altering reality, but that belief is affecting your perception of reality. The walls are in your heads.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>On this argument, I might direct people to a good book called "Godel, Escher &amp; Bach". It's a dense read but I found it informative.</p>

<p>In the work, they touch upon Godel's Incompleteness Theorems. In HEAVILY simplified form, Godel created a mathmatical paradox that exposes that all mathematics have underlying asumptions. If these implied assumptions are true, then the rest of mathematics holds true but if the assumptions aren't true, then the rest falls apart.</p>

<p>In an area where this might be more obvious, look at Euclidean geometry. There are five basic postulates that are "obvious" but can't be proven. These include things like "Two parallel lines can never cross" (actually this one is derived, but it isn’t written in the esoteric language of the real postulates)<br />
Thus geometry was born and chugged along happily for centuries.</p>

<p>However, along can Einstien with his theories that space can be curved. Suddenly, the postulates that Euclid used as a foundation might not be valid anymore. Near a black hole (let’s say) it might be possible for parallel lines to intersect.<br />
Now we have a whole field of mathematics devoted to non-Euclidean geometry where they build up a set of new rules when they consider one or more of Euclid’s postulates to be tweaked in some way. </p>

<p>While it’s hard to imagine (at least I can’t) a situation where 1+2 &lt;&gt; 3 or where 1+2 &lt;&gt; 2 +1 (neither of which can be "proved"); it doesn’t mean it’s impossible (just improbable) that people would conceptualize something outside the norm.</p>

<p>And given Xaositects love of freedom/chaos; I could see them trying to interpret all of existence in new ways and throwing out the "obvious" rules of being out the window in an effort to find something new.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Even simplified, that's not really what the Incompleteness theorems were saying, since that was already known by mathematicians at the time; that's what axioms are, after all.  Instead, what he did was demonstrate that any complete system (which in a broad sense means a system of equal power to that of arithmetic) could prove all statements about, for example, the natural numbers.  That is, in any system, either there are unprovable but true statements, or the system is inconsistent and self-contradictory.  Simplified I'd describe it more as "either you can't prove everything that's true, or you can prove literally everything you could possibly write a sentence in your system about". (*)  Even beyond that, you can actually make proofs on if a given statement is provable or not.  And as a consequence, it's possible to have statements in your system for which you can't even prove if you can prove them.  But you can prove if it's possible to prove you can prove them or not.  But then etc...</p>

<p>High-level logic is awesome, basically. <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/lol.png" title="Laughing out loud" alt="Laughing out loud" class="smiley-content"/></p>

<p>But yes, Godel, Escher, Bach is an awesome book and Hofstadter is an awesome writer.  It's definitely something with a lot of potential applications to Planescape.</p>

<p><span style="font-size:10px">(*): This is skippable if you don't care about details of proof-theoretic logic, but basically, if your system of logic can prove a contradiction - if it can prove A ^ ~A - then literally any statement that you can phrase in the system is provable.  It's called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_explosion" class="bb-url">Principle of Explosion</a>, and you can demonstrate it thusly:</span><br />
<span style="font-size:10px">Call your statement B, and let your contradiction be A ^ ~A.  ^ means AND, v means OR, ~ means NOT.  A ^ B is true if and only if A is true and B is true.  A v B is true if and only if A is true or B is true, or both are true.</span><br />
<span style="font-size:10px">1) A ^ ~A</span><br />
<span style="font-size:10px">2) A (from 1 via conjunction elimination: if you have a true conjunction, or AND, then both elements are true.)</span><br />
<span style="font-size:10px">3) ~A (from 1 via conjunction elimination)</span><br />
<span style="font-size:10px">4) A v B (from 2 via disjunction introduction: if you have a true statement, and you make a disjunction, or OR, between it and any statement, the resulting statement is true)</span><br />
<span style="font-size:10px">5) B (from 3 and 4 by disjunctive syllogism: if you have a true disjunction, and one of the elements is the negation of a true statement, the other must be true)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10px">Therefore (A ^ ~A) implies B for any possible statement B, and so any statement you can make in the system is provable.</span></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

Any time you set down one of your three arms, you'd lose an arm. The idea is impossible for us to fully wrap our heads around because it isn't the way our reality works, but that's what imagination and fiction are for. It'd be an inconsistent, illogical universe, but why can't we have those? </div></p>

<p>You know, what's funny is I've actually thought of having something just like that, based on a piece of flash fiction I read on 365 tomorrows (awesome site, by the way).  It was a similar situation, of someone abducted to a reality where 1+1 was 3, not 2.  So when you brought one item and another item together, you had three items.  I don't think it's illogical, though, because there's still a logic to it.  It's just a logic based on a different set of axioms than the axioms our reality holds.  If 1+1=3, then all that means is 3+1=5, 5+1=7, and so on; it's just Peano arithmetic with the successor function modified. <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/lol.png" title="Laughing out loud" alt="Laughing out loud" class="smiley-content"/></p>

<p>As for a truly inconsistent universe, my verisimilitude just won't let me imagine such a thing existing.  Any universe that appears to be inconsistent, I just can't help but assume and at times even derive a consistent set of underlying rules that resolves any apparent logical contradictions in the way things work.  It's just a personal quirk of mine, but if you show be an inconsistent fictional setting and works in that setting, I'll start coming up with ways to show it's not really inconsistent after all.  And if there is no way, if it somehow explicitly presents a contradiction in a way that can't be ignored...well, I guess it would depend on the quality of the writing.  It would have to be a <span style="text-decoration:underline">really</span> good writer to pull that off and not shatter my suspension of disbelief.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>I bring up dreams because who's to say that all reality in the Planescape multiverse isn't a dream? <span style="font-style:italic">A Guide to the Ethereal Plane</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">Doors to the Unknown</span>, and the Ravenloft <span style="font-style:italic">Nightmare Lands</span> boxed set all present a multiverse in which there are multiple levels of reality. There are places in the multiverse so real that we're just dreams to them, just as here are places that are less real, that are dreams to us. But if conventional reality is only someone else's dream, maybe it's only following dream-rules, illogical and governed by associations rather than consistency.</div></p>

<p>Ah, but dream rules are only illogical when compared to reality.  They still hold an underlying logic to them as your brain sorts and makes connections between events of the days, performing its cleanup operations and entertaining you with vaguely-related hallucinations until you wake up.  And there are still rules of logic that apply to dreams as a subset of the universe itself; while you can do just about anything in a dream, laws of physics brushed entirely aside, you still can't dream of a round square.</p>

<p>In fact, I'd say that if the Xaositects "won", nonlucid dreaming might be exactly what the universe would become.  (Lucid dreaming would be if the Signers "won", of course. <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/tongue.png" title="Sticking out tongue" alt="Sticking out tongue" class="smiley-content"/>)</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>So what if the Xaositects are right, and gravity isn't a consistent law but only something along the lines of a long-term trend, a momentary whirl that could easily reverse itself at any time? What if somewhere on the planes there are Shrodinger's cat people who are both false and true simultaneously, flickering in and out of what the PCs can perceive of as existence?</p>

<p>That would clearly be impossible.</div></p>

<p>I'm not even sure what that means.  Like, I literally can't even parse that sentence; what do you mean by someone that's false and true simultaneously?  I'm not sure what it even means for a person, or any physical object, to be false or true.  If you mean existent and nonexistent simultaneously, then I don't agree that that's impossible, just that it's not something that could occur in this universe.  But then again, I wouldn't say that "existent" and "nonexistent" are actually logical negations of one another.  This would be more like "the sky is blue" and "the sky is green"; two statements that are mutually contradictory in our universe, but still aren't technically negations of one another.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>I think that it would be a system where the "laws" of reality were so malleable that they essentially wouldn't even exist. </div></p>

<p>Are they really laws, then, or just guidelines? Does a  government that says "You're encouraged not to murder people, but we can't really stop you if you decide you really want to" have any laws?</p>

<p>I think the Xaositects may be trying to weaken the "laws" of reality in situations where they seem overly restrictive, but more fundamentally they're arguing that the laws of reality are <span style="font-style:italic">already</span> weak and malleable, and most people don't realize it. If they did, like Neo waking up in the Matrix, they'd be able to do a lot more. It's not that belief is altering reality, but that belief is affecting your perception of reality. The walls are in your heads.</div></p>

<p>That's exactly what I meant, yeah.  That's why I had laws in quotes. <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/tongue.png" title="Sticking out tongue" alt="Sticking out tongue" class="smiley-content"/></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>It'd be hard to describe a man who wasn't there but was there at the same time (though this is an advantage to a medium in which everything is words, not pictures). Imagining the person seeming to flicker as the PC's brain processes contradictory stimuli is the best I can do. You could figure out the effects, though: basically, every consequence of existing and not existing applies simultaneously. The man uses up air and he doesn't, he kills you and he doesn't, you kill him and you don't, and the characters see two overlapping realities simultaneously. Probably if he stays/doesn't stay for too long, the two realities are violently ripped apart.</p>

<p>As for the variant mathematics, it may be self-consistent mathematically, but it would, I think, require a copious amount of handwavium to describe. And it needn't be consistent mathematically. How about a reality where one and one is three, five and four is twenty, and nine and one is also three, and the weirdness only kicks in when you encounter those specific operations? So if you see a crowd of four people meet a crowd of five people, that's twenty people, but it's three groups, and if you divide the twenty people into two groups of nine people and two groups of one, that's six people altogether, which is two groups of three, which is really three groups of three.</p>

<p>Dreaming seems to me to be largely the process of rationalizing irrational events after the fact, imposing false narratives on chaos.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">
