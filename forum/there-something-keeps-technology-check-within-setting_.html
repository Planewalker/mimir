      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Mainly that planewalkers consider the prime world cities to be 'just another Berg' unless they're major wizards like Elminster/Mordenkainen/etc., in which case they probably guard against very much industrial-age technology entering their homeworld.</p>

<p>Another major, equally important factor is that magic items lose plusses the further away they are from their plane of origin.  Therefore, a Sigilian item taken to a prime world will lose 1 plus, meaning that it isn't profitable to craft a magic item on Sigil and then sell it on the prime.  The average prime-- hell, even the average 10th level wizard isn't ever going to travel to the Outlands, and probably won't spend longer than 45 minutes or so on the Astral, depending on what version of "spells that tap into the transient planes" rules you use (if you use the 2E rules, then chances are that wizard will NEVER enter the Astral).  Therefore, he's not going to buy a +2 Outlands sword for more than maybe 50% above the actual value for a +1 sword, because that's all it's worth on the Prime.<br />
In addition, on the Prime world you have ignorant yokel druids, rangers, paladins/blackguards/what have you, and clerics who aren't about to tolerate a massive gaggle of outsiders immigrating or setting up shop on their prime world.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>As for electronic-age stuff, well, probably because<br />
1. The races with that advanced level of technology probably have little interest in Sigil.<br />
2. Manufacture of the parts needed to supply a factory have to be shipped from the Prime World or wildspace region it originates from.  <br />
The race(s) with the technology are going to have the same degree of misconceptions and biases about the planes as their magic-using bretheren, and therefore only a select handfull of folks on their prime world will even be interested in planar travel.  Of them, only a small percentage are likely to possess the skills and knowledge needed to build a factory.  <br />
3. The Lady of Pain might not approve.  <br />
4. The factions might not approve.<br />
5. Advanced electronics emit various frequencies on the electromagnetic spectrum, as well as high-pitched noises (esp. the older stuff-- e.g. the stuff from the 60's-mid 90's)  Several races are likely to find these noises and frequencies to be highly noxious.  For another example, fluorescent lightbulbs (which emit infared, visible, AND ultraviolet light) are very likely to hurt the eyes of drow and other light-sensitive beings, and probably cause skin blistering for vampires.  Lighting the streets of Sigil with these things is likely to garner many complaints and possibly even decrease trade revenue, at least from the underdark races.<br />
6. Mages are going to have a chip on their shoulders about electronics, which would seriously cut into their revenues.  So you can bet that they, along with the clerics of magic deities, and druids are going to develop spells such as "Protection from Electronics, 10 ft. Radius", "Anti-electronics shell", "Halt Electronics" and "Destroy Electronics, Mass"<br />
Unfortunately, 'nilla electronics do not gain a saving throw against spells or damage.  It's not very profitable if a wizard can use a 4th level spell to permanently destroy the circuitry of your 1000gp piece of equipment, and the druid can simply cast a spell to make all micromissiles die upon coming within 10 feet of her (although that obviously wouldn't be enough to stop a bullet or laser.)</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>As clockworkdeity points out, the main reason technology isn't there is that it would spoil the flavor of the setting.  :^)</p>

<p>There is one place in the setting that's actively antithetical to technology: on the Beastlands, complicated tools revert to simpler forms for the duration of their stay on the plane.  Otherwise, there isn't any active force that seems to be dedicated to holding back technological progress.  Indeed, some races pride themselves on their inventiveness, so in the setting's future we might well see electronics and other technology.</p>

<p>Planes on which technology currently exists in an advanced state seem to be very "far" from the planes that are closely connected to the Great Ring in the regions Sigil connects to.  There is one explicitly Planescape adventure on the Ethereal that has the PCs rescue a dreamer in a high-tech stasis cell, but few others.  Since planes clearly group themselves and develop attaching portals when they share traits in common -- the elemental planes rarely connect to their opposites, the Outer Planes are firmly connected to ideologically similar planes -- it stands to reason that planes with a general take on magic and technology radically different from these would be separate from them altogether, except at very rare portals.</p>

<p>Without positing an intelligent Luddite power, it's possible to point out that the presence of magic can easily slow down technological advancement considerably.</p>

<p>First, the presence of magic fills many of the needs that technology might have filled.  Rich people and businesses paid for much early research; if a man of moderate means or education can already send a message instantly to a distant city by getting a mage to cast a communication spell, he will have less interest in developing a telegraph.  Military advances made for a lot of our technological progress, but armies with fireball-throwing mages and mercenary dragons don't have as much need for cannons and airplanes.  </p>

<p>Second, if someone does feel a need for making a service more readily available, inventors and researchers who might be inclined to produce a technological device have more educational resources available to them for the study of magic than of technology, and solutions to problems in their environment are often magical.  In sheer numbers, the smart people across the planes are divided so that fewer are working on technology.  Having gotten "on the ground" first, magic could be delaying honest technical research quite a bit.</p>

<p>Finally, high-tech inventions are often dangerous and hard to control in D&amp;D settings, like the <span style="font-style:italic">Machine of Lum the Mad</span> or the <span style="font-style:italic">Alchemist's Machine</span> in Ravenloft.  This reflects the state of affairs early in the Steam Age when experimentation with such devices was going on.  A fantasy-world explanation, which has tickled my fancy since I heard it, points out that high-tech equipment requires a lot of power, which must be stored: as gasoline, batteries, gunpowder, and so forth.  In a setting where little fire elementals and lightning mephits are fairly numerous and often running about loose, a ship full of fuel oil is a time bomb for a city that needs petroleum in large quantities.  Magic can cause equally troublesome disasters, of course, but at least it's a familiar quantity.</p>

<p>-----</p>

<p>And you can throw all of this out the window and play Planescape in d20 Modern too.  :^)</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Yesterday when I read the title "Is there something that keeps technology in check?" I was tempted to be snarky and write<br />
"Yes, it's called a DM"<br />
But seriously, this is a point that I've always wavered on.</p>

<p>Just to play batezu's advocate- <br />
A lot of the arguments against tech development could actually be considered as agruments for tech development if viewed from a different perspective.</p>

<p>For example, the lack of power sources was a major hindrance to a lot of technological innovation. But in a world where Unseen Servants can be created, elementals can be binded and generic magic could be used as an unlimited power source; no such hindrance would exist.<br />
Sure the end result would be a magic-tech hybrid rather than the pure technology that we have in the real world but I don't see anything that would prevent an Eberron equivalent of Leonardo daVinci to power his inventions with a simple "engine" spell<br />
Yes, it would be easier to learn to cast "Fly" than to build and then power a daVinci flying machine but for other less specific uses, such invention could prove useful. <br />
No mage wants to waste the time on researching a spell that would bale hay and place it in the barn loft. But I could see some inventive gnome mage, or an inventor that works for a good mage, inventing some simple inventions to do these tasks and then just getting an Unseen Servant to power them (and the same generic Servant could be moved from one simple engine to another so that one known spell could be used to accomplish multiple sundry tasks)</p>

<p>The mage might even appreciate this arrangement better as the inventions allow the wizard to be bothered LESS often. He just powers a Unseen Servant or an "engine" spell in the morning, leaves it with his lackey to use as needed and the tasks around the kingdom get done (and more work overall gets done) without interupting his reasearch for the rest of the day </p>

<p>Even consider the benefits of that would result from an industrious low-level mage selling off rocks upon which he has cast "Continual Light".<br />
Suddenly simple farmers (for a realatively low cost - I imagine) could buy something that would light their homes at night (at least one room) This would allow more work to be accomplished (normally limited during the nighttime hours) and might even result in his family becoming better educated which in turn might lead to more magic-tech advancement<br />
 [BTW - in my campaign, I frequently make wizards (but not sorcerors) come from a higher strata of society as they are the only ones with the spare time to study the Art]</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>But more to the point of what I think was the spirit of the original question, why isn't there more tech in Sigil and the planes in general?</p>

<p>Sure we can place whatever deus ex machina solution we want in place (i.e. The Lady/the gods/etc. won't allow it); but I always dislike using these solutions as it is an obvious imposition by the DM and seems clunky.</p>

<p>Even if a given world/plane hasn't reach a level of tech yet, it follows that in a multiverse with an infinite number of expiditions to an infinite number of Barrier Peaks (so to speak); that some tech would show up.<br />
I haven't read "Tales of the Comet" which I believe had some rules concerning introducing sci-fi tech without unbalancing your campaign; so I don't know what some of the canon suggestions are to accomplish this.</p>

<p>Personally, the few times that I've added high-tech stuff; I've limited its usefulness by:<br />
1) making it largely incomprehensible - if a laser blaster won't function 1 out of 4 times (or worse backfires); it may not seem so desirable<br />
2) giving it a limited power source. All attempt to repower it with magic are either ineffectual or, at best, create more problems regarding point #1<br />
E.g. maybe the PC can recharge the laser blaster with a Lightning Bolt; but with each recharge, the weapon become more unstable, less reliable and more likely to backfire<br />
3) making such items highly desirably by more powerful forces. In this way, it may be like an artifact. The PCs with a laser blaster might be hounded by a grasping demon lord who wants the item himself</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Sorry, I know I keep going on and on; but I was thinking back to my campaign</p>

<p>I had one unique setting on my home world that indirectly had a lot of tech. I based it on ancient Greece (largely because I wanted a society on my world based on the Greek legends I love). While it wasn't obvious, there was a sub-strata to this society that was paradoxically high-tech; but it was largely hidden from the PCs - they eventually realized many of the truths but while it was a treat for the players to realize the truth, it didn't affect the characters that much</p>

<p>This kingdom was ruled by an "undying king" (who turned out to be an android). The robot had taken control of the islands and had largely taken care of the people's needs.<br />
There was a Masked Society that took care of most of the kingdom's needs (built irrigation and made farming simple, built common buildings, etc.) and gather information (e.g. plant bugs to hear the plotting of conspiritors) The masks the servants wore broadcast information back to the king.<br />
For this reason, the Masked Society were considered as semi-divine avatars of the king (e.g. if a Masked Society member was killed, the rest of the society would know EXACTLY who had killed him) so over the years, NO ONE questioned them</p>

<p>Since the running of society was handled for them; this left the ruling class a lot of free time to pursue idle pasttimes (mainly pursuing epic Greek-legend type pursuits). </p>

<p>I also had a group of mages I called the technomancers that would created various clockwork type golems (e.g. a clockwork minotaur for the local lord to hunt down and kill)</p>

<p>The players really enjoyed imagining robotic minotaurs and hydras and realized that the "shock-staffs" where just electronic devises (used to recharge their creatures or to defend the wizard).<br />
As far as the "characters" were concerned, this technology was just another form of magic (robots=golems; shock-staff = wand (or rod) of lightning bolts)</p>

<p>In the spirit of the famous Arthur Clarke line, maybe your PCs have seen high-tech stuff but they just assumed it was magic</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

Another major, equally important factor is that magic items lose plusses the further away they are from their plane of origin.  Therefore, a Sigilian item taken to a prime world will lose 1 plus, meaning that it isn't profitable to craft a magic item on Sigil and then sell it on the prime.  The average prime-- hell, even the average 10th level wizard isn't ever going to travel to the Outlands, and probably won't spend longer than 45 minutes or so on the Astral, depending on what version of "spells that tap into the transient planes" rules you use (if you use the 2E rules, then chances are that wizard will NEVER enter the Astral).  Therefore, he's not going to buy a +2 Outlands sword for more than maybe 50% above the actual value for a +1 sword, because that's all it's worth on the Prime.</div></p>

<p>I'm not really sure what this post was about, Hyena, since he wasn't talking about people going to Primes or magic items, but actually it wouldn't.  All items created anywhere are at full power on the Prime, remember?</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>I can only speak for my particular campaigns/gaming groups - but for us the artificial "cap" on technology to a pre-gunpowder age is purely based on preference.</p>

<p>None of us like the thought of mixing tech and magic, we like to keep them far separated.  We could play a futuristic Gamma World type campaign, but if I tried to sneak in even a hint of magic, the players would get pretty upset.  Similarly, when playing a D&amp;D fantasy setting, if I ever put a robot or a laser blaster anywhere near that campaign, I'm pretty sure the players would get up and leave.</p>

<p>That's just the unwritten rule we've all agreed to.  No mixing of genres.  Though I must admit at times it's very hard for me to justify in my mind.  Let's think for a moment - if Einstein had a natural INT of 18, and boosted it up at level 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 [using 3rd ed. and assuming he's a level 20 inventor/ physicist] he would have a final score of 23.</p>

<p>Now in D&amp;D, through the use of spells, items and other means, mainly races with a higher starting INT - you could very well have creatures with intelligence ratings of 25... 30.... 40?</p>

<p>To such an almost godly intelligent creature, wouldn't things like the internal combustion engine and circuit boards be so naturally intuitive as to almost seem like child's play?</p>

<p>Again, for my crew there's really no tech higher than say, crossbows.  But that's just because it's the way we like it.  I don't expect other groups to follow suit.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Maybe items only work on the outer planes if you believe in them. Not casually, but deep down, in an archetypal level. Everything on the outer planes, beyond the dimensionless void of the Astral, is made of belief. True matter can't exist there, so it must be translated into ideas. A sword is easy to believe in, but something like a gun or a laptop is too new, too unreliable. Most people don't rally believe, deep down, in something their species didn't evolve along side. And so, in the outer planes, they're only dead metal and plastic. The ideas behind them haven't yet come to life.</p>

<p>That said, I don't really think the occasional technological item, far from the civilization that produced it, is that genre-breaking. Compact discs might surface in the Market Ward, mistaken for jewelry. Sherman tanks  might be discovered in the mines of Thuldanin. Sword and sorcery fiction is replete with lost civilizations whose technological wonders have been forgotten in the new barbarous age of magic, demons, and superstition that has buried the old world, which may have been our Earth, an alien colony world, or a parallel dimension. C.S. Friedman's Cold Fire trilogy (in which the power of belief makes technology too dangerous to use), Jack Vance's Dying Earth, and Gene Wolfe's New Sun/Long Sun series are all worth looking into. In fantasy RPGs, the Wilderlands of High Fantasy, Mystara, and the Empire of the Petal Throne are all magical worlds that had high technology in the forgotten past.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Another problem is that many tech devices are designed to work only in tech-friendly worlds. Example: I find a portal to Sigil and decide to move there. Naturally I take all my stuff with me, including my electric razor, my TV, DVD player, etc. Once I get there, I immediately have a insurmountable problem: NO ELECTRIC OUTLETS!!! Now, maybe my radio is battery-powered, but all I get is static. Few, if any, of my goods are going to be useable in Sigil or anywhere else in a typical D&amp;D-style setting. Even Ebberon, the most advanced tech setting so far, still won't have AC outlets or batteries to replace the ones in my (useless) radio. Hypothetically, I could take a crew of enginners to Sigil and have them install wall sockets, etc. and work out a way to supply the needed volts, but my home would still be a unique curiosity to the other residents. It would take years if not centuries of work to teach the citizens enough about modern tech for them to be able to switch over to a modern tech society - assuming they wanted to. (And no way in the Nine Hells is the Lady gonna let anybody built or bring in a nuke or other weapon of mass destruction!)</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>To make a reply on topic, I have to agree with Viking for the most part.  I think this is an issue where you don't need an in-setting explanation, you just have to chalk it up with "I and my group don't really want to have high-tech stuff in the game, so we won't".  Same reason why technology in the Marvel or DC universes is still at a modern level despite all the supergeniuses running around.  It doesn't really make sense, but you roll with it anyway if you want things that way because that's what you want it to be like.</p>

<p>If you want to have tech, go ahead, and if you don't, don't worry about coming up with an in-setting explanation, just talk it over with your group if they question it themselves.  And if they don't, don't even worry about bringing up the topic.</p>

<p>Although if you really <span style="text-decoration:underline">want</span> an in-setting explanation, I would agree with Rip's post on that.  And it would certainly make for an interesting dichotomy for having this stuff not work on the Outer Planes due to not believing in it, and having it work just fine on the Inner.  It'd be a good way to give kind of a "science vs. belief" type theme to your game if you wanted that sort of thing.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>I'm not sure I buy that.  Kids today grow up with cellphones and laptops in their hands, and operate them with an almost astonishing degree of natural intuition, and my mother can't operate a VCR without help (let's not even talk about a DVD player).  So in one or two generations we have a complete transformation of how pervasive a role tech plays in our society.  It's this simple:  If it's available, people will master it.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>The "general agreement" argument works fine if there is a general agreement; but sometimes, one or more player does want to mix genres. <br />
If only the DM wants to keep genres pure, then the DM should consider options to allow for limited exposure. E.g. agreeing to run Expedition to the Barrier Peaks with pre-generated characters with the agreement that any goodies they gather will not make it back to the main campaign.<br />
It gets further complicated if more than one person takes on DMing responcibilities and one wants to run an adventure with sci-fi elements and another doesn't<br />
Admittedly, this is all more of questions for "how to play together nicely"  than "what keeps technology in check"</p>

<p>But even then, sometimes might want to have an occasional genre-bending adventure. But once a PC has a laser blaster in hand (and perhaps he needed one to complete the genre-bender) how does the DM get rid of it without just waving his god-like hand? How does he explain no one else in the multiverse having anything similar?</p>

<p>My suggestions are just for those who want an occasional genre bending adventure but doesn't want it to be permanent feature (or at worst, only want it as a limited feature) of a continous campaign</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>The technology limit is up to the DMs and players, some want only the Dark Ages, some it might be acceptable up to the Renaissance, for me I sort of like the 19th century as the upper limit.  I don't have excuse for why that would be the upper limit of technology, for me it just is because I said so.</p>

<p>I find this "not mixing genres" to be a troubling development, because early sci-fi and fantasy at the beginning of the 20th century, the lines were a lot more blurred.  After all John Carter of Mars had swordfights on Mars.  I don't think it was until the latter half of that century that there was a clear dividing line between the two.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

I don't see why the tools would be difficult to create. But that's probably besides the point as the topic is just looking for reasons why technology hasn't advanced past a certain point on the planes; and I think a number of good suggestions have been made</p>

<p>In the proper cultural context, maybe. But being smart doesn't automatically give you ideas if you have no frame of reference for them. Even if you do, there are many kinds of intelligence and many ways to channel that; Bobby Fischer was a really clever chess player, but he didn't do anything to advance computer science. I don't care how smart Archimedes or Leonardo or Zhuge Liang were; they didn't invent internal combustion or circuit boards because those things simply weren't part of the zeitgeist of their eras.

         <p>I agree with you VanWormer up to a point.<br />
I do think that if daVinci, etc. had known of convenient sources of oil; then they probably could/would have invented primitive combustion engines.</p>

<p>Also, given the infinite nature of the planes, infinite zeitgeists exist. Sure the Europeans didn't have the chemistry knowledge/zeitgeist to invent gunpowder firearms; but the Chinese did (and that was just on one limited planet).<br />
Once the Europeans knew about it, they definitely jumped on it. </p>

<p>So by the same logic, a large number of inventions would reach Sigil (a major trade hub - or a least a travel hub) and people would latch on to the inventions that would serve their needs. This cross-pollination of ideas would create the zeitgeist.</p>

<p>On the otherhand, some zeitgeist of a magic-infused universe would impede some science (IMHO)<br />
For example, if electricity is just viewed as a magical/elemental force that can be harnessed via magic; then it is unlikely that a Ben Franklin/Tesla/etc. would investigate the underlying scientific principles of electron flow.<br />
And for that reason, electronics as a science would probably never develop</p>

<p>I guess that in a universe with demonstratrable elemental planes, one might argue that across the multiverse, there wouldn't be much of the modern (atomic/molecular) chemistry we have today</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>Hyena of Ice</em> wrote:</div>He wouldn't be able to use his magic there.  One of the Spelljammer modules (practical planetology, I think) gives the stats for the Sol System, and it warns that within this crystal sphere, spells, psionics, and supernatural abilities DO NOT work.</div></p>

<p>There are many different versions of Earth in D&amp;D. I tend to assume they all exist somewhere in the multiverse. </p>

<p>There are "stats" for the Earth System in the <span style="font-style:italic">Concordance of Arcane Space</span> (part of the original Spelljammer boxed set), page 90, but the information is limited to telling us how far apart the system's planets are. There's nothing about magic. <span style="font-style:italic">Practical Planetology</span> has nothing to say about Earth or its system.</p>

<p>Module X2 <span style="font-style:italic">Castle Amber</span> allowed player characters to take a portal into the Earth described by Clark Ashton Smith in his Averoigne stories. Magic worked fine there.</p>

<p>The "Gothic Earth" of the Masque of the Red Death setting had somewhat limited magic, but there were definitely spells and spellcasters there.</p>

<p>In the adventure "City Beyond the Gate" in Dragon #100, Earth has no native magic, but characters from the D&amp;D world who go there can use the magic they bring for a limited amount of time. </p>

<p>The "Historical Reference" or HR series described various historical and legendary eras of Earth in 2nd edition terms. Usually various options were given ranging from no magic to unlimited magic, depending on the DM's preference. </p>

<p>The adventure IM1, <span style="font-style:italic">The Immortal Storm</span>, involves Immortal characters traveling to New York and Chicago. Magic is simply impossible there. </p>

<p>Midgard is the world of Norse myth and legend, where the Norse pantheon rules. It's mentioned in Dragon #90, the 1st edition <span style="font-style:italic">Manual of the Planes</span>, and the <span style="font-style:italic">Northern Reaches Gazetteer</span>. Magic works on this world, though it isn't as prevalent as it is on some. </p>

<p>In Polyhedron #21, Gary Gygax said there was a whole continuum of parallel Earths, distinguished from one another by the relative strength of magic or technology on them. Our Earth was at one end of the scale, with high technology and no magic, and Oerth is an extreme Earth parallel on the other end, with gunpowder and advanced technology impossible but magic prevalent.</p>

<p>The 1st edition <span style="font-style:italic">Manual of the Planes</span> included charts (in its Appendix I) to help define the different physical and magical limits on the various alternate Material Planes. Gunpowder and internal combustion engines are impossible on planes with a physical factor of 1 or less, while with higher physical factors matter becomes more chemically reactive. A non-magical version of Earth would have a physical factor of 5 (gasoline engines and firearms possible, flight restricted to small hollow-boned creatures, bipeds over 10 feet tall unlikely). At a physical factor of 10, all matter reacts with all other matter explosively and sentience is impossible. At -5, fire can burn without consuming fuel and gravity is a matter of opinion. At -10, the whole plane is aware and all movement is instantaneous by thought, and all elements are found only in their pure state. At -11 and below, all elements return to their home planes.</p>

<p>Alternate primes also got a magical factor: at 10, all races have unlimited magical abilities, with their power constrained only by their imaginations. These planes are said to quickly dissolve into demiplanes ruled by individuals. One character from a world like this appeared in Dragon #159; he'd gotten bored with omnipotence and retired to the Astral Plane, where his powers were more limited, to open a business ferrying adventurers across the plane for hire. At -7, no spells work, creativity and imagination are impossible, and songs disappear.  At -10, no magic, creativity, or imagination exist. At -11 and lower, sentience is impossible.  The <span style="font-style:italic">Manual of the Planes</span> gives "a typical 20th century world" a magical factor of -5 (Spells that rely on Powers of other planes do not operate. Maximum of 3rd level spells possible), but states that this rating varies according to the nature of the campaign.</p>

<p>The <span style="font-style:italic">Urban Arcana</span> setting, where Estevan visits, is yet another parallel Earth (though theoretically it could be the future of the Masque of the Red Death setting). Magic explicitly works on this world; that's the whole point of the setting.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>Palomides</em> wrote:</div>Also, given the infinite nature of the planes, infinite zeitgeists exist.</div></p>

<p>Sure, if you assume there are infinite combinations of planes available, and they're all equally accessible from Sigil, it's impossible to argue that technology doesn't reach it, and commonly, assuming technology works as well there as it does on their worlds of origin.</p>

<p>But there's no reason to assume all those things. And I think you're crazy if you do assume them. I can't imagine a Sigil with a completely unlimited connection to every kind of world, not if it's going to continue to feel like Sigil (or anything, really; it'd be hard for a mish-mash of Jedi knights, Bugs Bunny, and Marvel Comics to have much of a character of its own, awesome as it might be). Sigil only has portals to worlds the Lady of Pain (and DM) wants it to have portals to. For my own sanity, I tend to assume it mostly touches only a few worlds commonly; I tend to imagine a smaller multiverse for convenience's sake. There's no hard limit on how many worlds the Cage's portals can touch, and there can certainly be some brief, weird sojourns to anywhere and everywhere, but I like the idea that it generally sticks to worlds that are at least vaguely recognizable as D&amp;D-esque.</p>

<p>Since I'm looking through the first edition <span style="font-style:italic">Manual of the Planes</span>, I'll note the solution it imposes. Different alternate Material Planes have different physical and magical factors. Alternate worlds with high technology do exist, but the outer and inner planes seem to have the same technological limit as "typical" D&amp;D worlds. Beyond that, the local laws of physics seem to conspire to keep the multiverse mired in medieval times.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>While I was arguing larger theoricals; in my actual campaign I'm pretty close to what you suggest.</p>

<p>In the Prime I have a dimensional axis for time and another for "probabilities" (think alternative realities)<br />
Since the Outer Planes are of the mind, I have a setup where all the worlds at a certain level of frame of "consciousness" have access to their appropriate-level Sigil (and corresponding planes)<br />
All the worlds at a modern level (or a futuristic level), connect to their own unique Sigil(s) that reflect that relative level. <br />
[By the same token, there could be a parallel Sigil at the same level of technology as "regular" Sigil but with various differences - e.g. orcs are civilized and humans are brutish thugs, or a reality like the "evil mirror" universe from Star Trek, etc.<br />
I was thinking of having one parallel reality where the Norse gods were extremely dominant. One change in this reality would be the instead of the Spire in the Outlands; one sees the trunk of Yssgadril in the center of the multiverse]</p>

<p>I even had one depressed character in Sigil who was displaced from a future time and alternate reality. He was having difficulty adapting to the Sigil we all know</p>

<p>I toyed with an adventure involving the PCs returning him home (and getting a brief glimpse of "future" Sigil and a few other locations - since I don't have the time to completely re-write all of the planes from a different frame of reference)</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><span style="font-style:italic">Also, given the infinite nature of the planes, infinite zeitgeists exist. Sure the Europeans didn't have the chemistry knowledge/zeitgeist to invent gunpowder firearms; but the Chinese did (and that was just on one limited planet).<br />
Once the Europeans knew about it, they definitely jumped on it.</span> <br />
Gunpowder doesn't require specialized micro-tools to manufacture.  Circuitry does, and it would be impossible to create a working circuit using mideval blacksmithing technology.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">I guess that in a universe with demonstratrable elemental planes, one might argue that across the multiverse, there wouldn't be much of the modern (atomic/molecular) chemistry we have today</span><br />
That was another thing I considered.  Arcanists might still study electrons, etc. as such insight might make it easier for them to manipulate electrical energy, but anything as or more advanced than the internal combustion engine would be seen as too much of a hassle when you can pay a bit more and have a magical construct with an unlimited energy supply.<br />
Practical Planetology tells us that supernatural powers as defined in D&amp;D don't work in the Sol system.  <br />
We also see the Giff from the Spelljammer setting, who use gunpowder and simple firearms instead of supernatural powers, which their race is physically unable to harness.<br />
So perhaps advanced technology only becomes invented and spreads to crystal spheres and among races whereupon magic and psionics do not function.  <br />
These races will have no interest in visiting Sigil because its societies are based on magic or psionics rather than technology-- energy sources which these races are unable to harness either on their homeworld or anywhere.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">There are "stats" for the Earth System in the Concordance of Arcane Space (part of the original Spelljammer boxed set), page 90, but the information is limited to telling us how far apart the system's planets are. There's nothing about magic. Practical Planetology has nothing to say about Earth or its system.</span></p>

<p>Well, I know I read it in one of the Spelljammer books.  It's in a paragraph/area of text that warns DMs to think long and hard before encorporating the Sol system into their campaign, and I'm quite certain it was in a book rather than on the SpellJammer fansite.  Concordance of Arcane Space sounds like the source I was thinking of, because the book DID give the stats for the Sol System planets-- namely the distances between them.  The warning, in addition to mentioning that supernatural powers don't work-- therefore a Spelljammer will go dead on the spot upon entering Solspace, also states that the physics within the crystal sphere are completely different.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Module X2 Castle Amber allowed player characters to take a portal into the Earth described by Clark Ashton Smith in his Averoigne stories. Magic worked fine there.</span><br />
That's the Mystara setting however, which followed vastly different rules.  I mean, you have the ruins of Blackmoor which house nuclear reactors and such.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">The "Historical Reference" or HR series described various historical and legendary eras of Earth in 2nd edition terms. Usually various options were given ranging from no magic to unlimited magic, depending on the DM's preference.</span><br />
Those were for playing historical settings, though, which wouldn't necessarily have anything to do with the canon.</p>

<p>Also, the parralel earths was primarily a 1E thing, where originally Oerth and Abeir-Toril were supposed to be parralel earths.  This idea was abandoned at some point in 2E.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">I can't imagine a Sigil with a completely unlimited connection to every kind of world, not if it's going to continue to feel like Sigil (or anything, really; it'd be hard for a mish-mash of Jedi knights, Bugs Bunny, and Marvel Comics to have much of a character of its own, awesome as it might be).</span><br />
Don't forget the Xmen and Final Fantasy settings (which would be a nightmare to represent using any version of D&amp;D or AD&amp;D rules...)</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Different alternate Material Planes have different physical and magical factors.</span><br />
Which prettymuch jives with what I read in whatever sourcebook it was about the Sol System-- the physics vary by Crystal Sphere.  Whereas in the plogiston you don't have these limitations, except on technology to a lesser extent (however, the spacefarers in technological settings probably end up in an alternate 'deep space', which could very well overlap with the phlogiston.)</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>The Mystara setting was brought into the Planescape cosmology in 2nd edition, which is why you see a Mystaran Darklord in Ravenloft, a Mystaran shadow elf (Farrow) in Sigil, Mystaran Immortals given realms in the AD&amp;D outer planes in <span style="font-style:italic">Warriors of Heaven</span>, and numerous references to the Planescape cosmology in the <span style="font-style:italic">Mystara Monstrous Compendium Appendix</span>. So all of that setting's baggage is part of Planescape... though it's not exactly clear how, always. </p>

<p>In the case of Averoigne from <span style="font-style:italic">Castle Amber</span>, though, Roger E. Moore claimed in his "Chronomancy and the Multiverse" essay (found on the WotC website) that it was the same world as Gothic Earth from <span style="font-style:italic">Masque of the Red Death</span>. He also said the Historical Reference series detailed the same world in different eras, and there was an article in Dragon #249 ("Seeds of Evil" by James Wyatt) that explored this connection in greater detail. </p>

<p>Canon is a myth, anyway. There's a body of D&amp;D materials, but no real plan for consistency between them. Some writers are more consistent than others, but that's more of a nicety than anything else. Certainly at this late date, in the 4e era, it seems pointless to argue about whether something is canonical or not.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>In terms of an institution to keep people from advancing technology, I think the first is the inventors own need for secrecy. Like the Chronomancers, the explanation for chronomancy being extremely rare, as rare as advanced tech, is: -it's practicers keep it a secret because they are afraid what the knowledge could do, also, they enjoy their special status.<br />
-there are temporal entities that stand watch over any major chronomantic activity, these are more self appointed guardians than gods or universal forces. As for tech, there could be a self appointed anti-tech task force of a secret society of high tech primes&amp;planars. The task force could also be formed from "concerned" spellcasters<br />
-Even if the knowledge spreads, of a high tech or a super secret magic technique, it isn't long before some high up hears of it, appears on the scene, takes all the knowledge for himsef and destroys everyone and everything that can allow these secrets to reach others. </p>

<p>BUT!</p>

<p>Well, who are we to say that there isn't a lot more technology in Sigil than we see at the canon material? For one, I think there are a lot of elevators in Sigil, operated by whatever magical or mechanical means possible. There is paper, as the modern paper, notebooks, pencils, and mass printing machines, and probably typing machines of some sort used by guvners. The Fated needed these things and some good calculator-like computers - Probably something along the lines of "Difference Engine" was hidden somewhere in their HQ before the Faction War.<br />
Mages and Alchemists can find more advanced lab equipment than is available in most of the multiverse in Sigil, provided they can afford it.<br />
There were night lights in the city before they were vandalised by street urchins with light sticks. They could have been electrical(lightning operated), and, if they were indeed electrical, there may be some sort of underground power grid in the city that people didn't know what to do with. A few berks were electrocuted, so people destroyed whatever outlets they came accross. More clever cutters on the Lady's Ward may find uses for them for small household applications or even traps. A few establishments in the Lower Ward use them still without knowing where it comes from. If One of their lightning Ovens malfunction, they have to call in that strange old guy from a backwater prime, who makes his living by repairing such strange objects.<br />
As there are illithids and vampires in the city that somehow live under the radar, there can also be a group of androids from a very advanced part of the multiverse, living in human guise in everyday.<br />
There can be radios, telephones or even wi-fi in Sigil without you ever knowing. Well, actually, thats how most of those telephatic types communicate: Some of the races in Sigil, like Fiends, can actually hear &amp; emit radiowaves without the need for extra equipment. Thats how they communicate among themselves, and order their lesser minions around, maybe? If so, they will not only not share the technology with mortals, they will do everything in their power to keep the tech secret. <br />
There are probably guns, even machine guns, in select hands within Sigil. Some golden lords with many hands in many prime worlds probably keep them as a last resort plan in case things get rough. Other than that, ammunition problems limit their use.</p>

<p>Advance Tech Visitors:<br />
Come on, how many people have left in the world who carry a weapon on them all the time any way? They'll probably be fully defenseless when they stumble upon a door in the store and find themselves in Sigil. The chances of strange tech showing up in Sigil is very high. The chance of it being a weapon is very low. The chance of a non weapon magic item being of any use is even lower. Say some one from a technologically advanced part of prime shows up, waving his i-gadget around, wandering why he doesn't get any service, at the same time he doens't carry a gun. The first planar tough guy coming across will peel him blind, kill him and sell his body to the local dustmen. The robber will than try to sell his "valuable magical items", if he didn't already break them. At best these will find itself to the hands of a canny inventor who will try reverse engineering.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><span style="font-style:italic">For one, I think there are a lot of elevators in Sigil, operated by whatever magical or mechanical means possible.</span></p>

<p>Elevators aren't all that technically advanced, really.  It's just an automatic/electric dumbwaiter, is all, and we've had dumbwaiters at least since the middle ages if not before.  You can accomplish that with fiendish hamsters running in their wheels.  Or by enchanting a dumbwaiter.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">There is paper, as the modern paper, notebooks, pencils, and mass printing machines, and probably typing machines of some sort used by guvners.</span><br />
Yeah, it's called a wizard and his animated inkquill (or animated printing press-- they'd have those, too, and the animation spell would only be like 1st level for an NPC wizard running a printing press and 0th level for a wizard running an inkpen).</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">The Fated needed these things and some good calculator-like computers</span><br />
Just use a magic 8 ball variant and a cantrip.  Keyboards require circuitry which is far beyond 19th century-level/steampunk technology.  </p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">They could have been electrical(lightning operated), and, if they were indeed electrical, there may be some sort of underground power grid in the city that people didn't know what to do with.</span><br />
Doubtful.  Using the 3x item enchantment rules (including those from Stronghold Builder's Guidebook), all you'd have to do is use a light spell and some costly materials, and you have yourself a permanent street light.  Electricity requires bundled, fine, plastic-covered wiring that would not have been available in the early to mid 19th century.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">A few berks were electrocuted, so people destroyed whatever outlets they came accross. More clever cutters on the Lady's Ward may find uses for them for small household applications or even traps.</span><br />
Actually, if your theory were actually correct, all that wiring would be long, long gone by now-- melted down into spell components and spare metals for smithies, much like what happens in real life in industrialized nations with a heavy abundance in such resources.  Once the Sigilians discover the circuitry, they'll be gutting it for their own personal use or to sell, recognizing the copper.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">You're not from the US, are you?</span><br />
Yeah, and it's even more common to be constantly armed in 3rd world countries.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

Actually, I believe that Thomas Jefferson invented (or at least had one of the first) dumbwaiters; but the point still holds as I don't see any technilogical limitation to have kept them from having been invented earlier in time</p>

<p>On a related note, abaci (abacuses?) had been effective calculators for centuries. While I could see the appeal of a Fated/Merkant/etc. getting his hands on a calculator; I don't think that they would be a push to invent the field of electronics just to create a calculator when the abacus serves most of their needs</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Uh...Hyena, keyboard-style typewriters have been around since 1855.  You can certainly make a keyboard with pre-19th-century technology even, it's just no one had thought of the design before that.  If you really had to, you could use a dial-style interface, which has been around since 1829.  Whichever style you go with, have it hooked up to a mechanical Analytical Engine-type design or something if you were really wanting to include a not-as-comparatively-high-tech-computer for use by the Fated (or the Guvners, for that matter).</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>VikingLegion, when I said it would take years or centuries for the populace to upgrade to modern tech, I was talking not about learning to USE a particular item (i.e. a cellphone, etc.) but about learning to BUILD ONE from scratch. We both know how to use one, but could either of us make one? Could we explain EXACTLY how it works well enough for someone else to build another like it? NO. It requires factories with specialised tools (and a sterile enviroment for computer chips and such). The Great Foundry only makes fairly crude metal objects. But in order to get to that point, you'd first have to gradually upgrade the existing tech knowledge step by step to get to where we are today - you couldn't just leap from medieval technology to today's in one step. You need the tools to make the tools, as they say... modern tech is made to very fine specifications aided by computer design and requiring finely callibrated tools. (I suppose the intervention of a Power who was fond of technology could do the trick, however!)</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>To toot GURPS' horn a little, they have a system that talks about Tech Levels, with the levels differentiated in a society by the amount of knowledge a typical person has.  Since the nutshell version is in their free pdf, GURPS Lite, I think I can safely reprint it here:</p>

<p>TL0	Stone Age (Prehistory and later)<br />
TL1	Bronze Age (3500 B.C.+)<br />
TL2	Iron Age (1200 B.C.+)<br />
TL3	Medieval (600 A.D.+)<br />
TL4	Age of Sail (1450+)<br />
TL5	Industrial Revolution (1730+)<br />
TL6	Mechanized Age (1880+)<br />
TL8	Digital Age (1980+)<br />
TL9	Microtech Age (2025+?)<br />
TL10	Robotic Age (2070+?)<br />
TL11	Age of Exotic Matter.<br />
TL12+	Whatever the GM likes!</p>

<p>Tech Levels affect things, starting with what equipment is available: full plate was a fairly late medieval invention, and the rapier requires good steelsmithing which is actually early Renaissance, about TL4.    Starting equipment for characters changes (GURPS doesn't attach equipment to power levels as much, though you can be rich for points).  You, in the 20th-century world, could buy a masterwork sword that would have been a royal prerogative to a medieval king!</p>

<p>They're also attached to some skills: the skill of animal handling or shooting a bow hasn't changed too much over the centuries (though running a farm has), while an armourer from a Tech Level 2 Iron Age society like Rome will not have the knowledge needed to create full plate, or possibly even good steel armor, since his skill is Armoury/TL2.  A sailor on Ahab's vessel wouldn't have the basic engine maintenance or radio skills a sailor of a modern cargo ship would need.  Skills that can be used without training are also affected; a medieval peasant doesn't get a default Piloting (Helicopter).</p>

<p>Something that's especially relevant here is the timeline.  The pace of Tech Level changes picks up madly at TL4 -- the reason is the invention of the printing press.  Suddenly, information could move around and get where it was wanted, much more cheaply and widely disseminated.</p>

<p>As in the example Rip gave above, high Tech Level is great on worlds where physics is predictable, but less so in worlds like the Astral or the Ethereal, where thought makes things malleable.  It's an optional rule that Tech Level is a penalty to skill use there, so that ancient tools like an axe (TL0) -- or your punch -- work just fine, while a rapier starts to lose that keen edge, a Colt .45 is more likely to misfire than not, and you can forget about the electronics in that laser gun or laptop computer.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Also I forgot to consider that there are several Wizard and Cleric spells that might be able to create copies of high-tech devices, and then of course there's always WISH... although I remember reading in one of the spell descriptions that you had to be able to understand what you were duplicating in order for the spell to work (it mentioned a Wizard trying to make a copy of a handgun he found, without success because he didn't understand the principles behind how it worked.)</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Another issue is what the Lady would allow to enter the city... if for some reason she just doesn't LIKE high-tech devices, then none will be entering, plain and simple. Or maybe She only allows in tech up to a certain level (i.e. flintlocks o.k., bazookas and hand grenades no.) It could be that She has a certain tech level She prefers, and inforces it. Of course, Sigil isn't the only place with portals, so this wouldn't prevent tech from speading to other planes or the Prime. Perhaps the Powers have seen what happens in alternate universes where tech was allowed, and chose to prevent it (i.e. maybe some alternate version of Oerth or Toril had a nuclear war, and the gods decided to keep this from happening on their turf.)</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>This thread has been quiet for coming up on a year, but I've been thinking about exactly basically this topic and so it was an interesting read and I'll go ahead and put some thoughts out there.</p>

<p>I've been trying to get to the bottom of what it is that rubs me the wrong way about mixing up technology with Planescape (and D&amp;D more broadly). And while I side with the "flavor of the setting" crowd, the conclusion I've come to is that what upsets the flavor for me isn't technology per se, it's <strong>our</strong> technology. That is, contemporary Earth technology (and typical contemporary visions of future technology - laser blasters, etc). And I think the root of it all is that I'm utterly uninterested in bringing the real world into the game. It's a little tough for me to say why - maybe it's simply that D&amp;D is a fantasy game (with Planescape being pretty freaky and alien on top of all that) and our world is fundamentally at odds with that. And if our artifacts are going to exist then it seems as if all of our banal crap must exist as well and suddenly it's Wal-Mart billboards in the Outlands.</p>

<p>Thinking about other settings that integrate technology into magic-having fantasy worlds, I feel as if the ones that do it well tend to veer the technology down crazy alternate paths. I was in a store today and glanced at 'Forces of Warmachine: Cryx', Cryx being the undead kingdom of the steampunk-y Warmachine world (about which I know nothing more than what I just said). Obviously steampunk has probably lost much of its exoticism at this point, but Necrotech? Yes please. Do tell me more.</p>

<p>What finally prompted me to try and sort this out for myself was going off on a random Jack Kirby kick and realizing that awesome images like <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Jhu_c3iV6VQ/THlFo-MaCpI/AAAAAAAAC3U/x2pUlNwkh_k/s1600/jk7.jpg">this one</a> seemed to provide some kind of peculiar inspirational fodder for something that might exist in a Planescape and/or Spelljammer world, technology intact (here's <a href="http://nerdcityonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/godland25.jpg">one by Tom Scioli</a> that caught my attention).</p>

<p>None of this really answers the question that this thread posed in the first place. An easy answer I've thought about might be that physics (and possibly magic) conspire against technology in a similar way to how quantum mechanics is going to muck up your atomic-scale catapult. I suppose a more interesting answer is that the technology that I can get with is advanced and/or alien enough to meet Arthur C. Clarke's "indistinguishable from magic" declaration - and we're pretty good at dealing with magic. (Also, does the inverse of that apply? "Any sufficiently mundane magic is indistinguishable from technology." Not quite the inverse, but that seems like something to knock around.)</p>

<p>That's a lot more yammering than I planned on right there.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><span style="font-style:italic">Actually, I believe that Thomas Jefferson invented (or at least had one of the first) dumbwaiters; but the point still holds as I don't see any technilogical limitation to have kept them from having been invented earlier in time</span><br />
Uh, I'm pretty sure I've seen stuff about dumbwaiters in mideval castles (granted these generally only supported 25-50 lbs of weight)  Like I said, it's just a pulley with a level platform.  They had pulleys all the way back during King Ramses II's time.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Uh...Hyena, keyboard-style typewriters have been around since 1855. You can certainly make a keyboard with pre-19th-century technology even, it's just no one had thought of the design before that. If you really had to, you could use a dial-style interface, which has been around since 1829. Whichever style you go with, have it hooked up to a mechanical Analytical Engine-type design or something if you were really wanting to include a not-as-comparatively-high-tech-computer for use by the Fated (or the Guvners, for that matter).</span><br />
Oh, yeah, I forgot that the first typewriters were nothing more than a panel full of levered buttons with a printing press at the other end.</p>

<p>As for Barrier Peaks and Tales of the Comet, the primary purpose behind those was to create a module and rules allowing players to transfer their D&amp;D characters to the Alternity or (I can't remember what the other scifi setting was).  </p>

<p>Another problem I had not thought of earlier-- the tech graveyards contain items made of titanium, tungsten, and other elements that pre-industrial characters would not be familiar with (thus making it difficult to repair or rebuild such devices).  Many of them will also contain rare earth elements-- many rare earth elements are highly unstable or volatile in their natural states, which would make it near impossible for a wizard to work with unless he knows exactly what he's doing-- which would require at least basic knowledge of molecular chemistry.  The wizard might be able to rig up a battery or other industrial device using primitive technology, but such devices will be far too inefficient to power objects of modern or futuristic technology.<br />
Typically, from what I recall of adventure modules (including Doors to the Unknown), technological devices are only usable so long as they're functional as-is.  Once they use up all their charges or need repair, they are useless because the characters of the D&amp;D world lack the technology needed to recharge or repair such items (simply infusing a battery or engine with electricity or a lightning quasielemental won't work any better then trying to recharge on IRL by getting it struck by lightning-- the circuitry will be fried, and in all likelihood any delicate parts will be blasted or burnt to bits)</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Regarding the whole question of technology in the setting, I decided I liked Rip's idea that Prometheus' imprisonment was preventing technological development.  In the latest game arc I GM'ed, in fact, I had him locked up in the Towers of Storm, Ice, Radiance, and Lead on the positive quasielemental planes; the Titan's fundamental creativity leaking out there gives them their powers.  And when the PCs needed a shortcut from one to another, they crossed the body of the Titan himself -- invisible, but whispering to them of things they couldn't fully understand.  The artificer especially.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

</div></p>

<p>Exactly. And I suppose in my personal version of this fiction, a fighter plane in the wreckage of Acheron is an ugly orange of epic proportions. Though obviously this wheels back around to the heart of my issue, which isn't so much technology as it is contemporary Earth stuff. I'm tentatively finding a place for cosmic space god tech, for crying out. Love your approach with the Titan, in any case.</p>

<p>It seems as if the original poster isn't around here anymore - I'm a little unsure if the original question was taking the existence of high-tech as canon (and asking, quite reasonably, why it hadn't overrun Sigil) or if this was a thought experiment of another kind.</p>

<p>Sauron and Voldemort take me back to an awesome memory from my first D&amp;D experience - we were probably 9 or 10 years old, with a red box set passed down from someone's older brother. The DM (which changed basically every session) would completely make everything up as we went along, fielding characters like Lawful George and wielding awesome/stupid magic items like the Bag of Blending. One week the DM decided to run us up against <a href="http://www.fightersgeneration.com/np7/char/galactus-lava.jpg">Galactus</a> (of Fantastic Four and Silver Surfer fame). To his credit, he didn't just say "It's Galactus!" since our characters wouldn't have known who that was. And I can still summon the image that I came up with based on his description of G's purple suit and fancy headgear. </p>

<p>We saved the world that day, from a giant in a purple tuxedo and an antique diving helmet.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>The thing about Sauron and Voldemort, is they're busy trying to conquer their tiny little prime worlds and, only once they're done with those, would they move outward into the rest of the planes.  And that is a fundamental truth about why Cagers are so damned cocky ... while "great self proclaimed evil destined to rule everything" is busy trading blows on some insignificant prime, Planers are out there shaping the very stuff of belief and creation.  In the planes Sauron is "just another primordial evil" to be added to a very long list ... and sure he is mighty and all, but is he mighty as Aoskar, whom the Lady of Pain killed because he became a nuisance?</p>

<p>In my games I try to remind players that, merely because they are planer adventurers, they need to have larger than life goals.  Adventurers in the planes may pop from world to world, shake it to the core, then move on as a matter of course.  They are more akin to Greek Heroes, than simple adventurers with a thirst for cash.  </p>

<p>As for Tech on the planes, I don't have a problem with it.  My usual reasoning behind why you don't see much of it is, tech is typically more fragile than its magical equivalent, so it doesn't wear well as you travel from one hostile environment to another.  The people in Sigil are, if not born on the planes, typically those of significant power and knowledge in their own worlds ... so high level wizards/heroes, and inventors working in theoretical physics, designing strange machines which rely heavily on non-euclidean mathematics.  When dealing with the latter, we see that the types of science they use to breach the planes are not going to be the things we are familiar with in our world - in our fiction, sure, but not in real world applications.  So, television and race cars are less likely than machines designed to beam entertainment directly into your mind via a webwork of wire connectors and glass transistors, or vehicles made of single, large wheels set around a gyroscopic seating mechanism ... scientists in Sigil will be the DeVinci's and visionaries like Jules Verne; so science would reflect that.  Beyond this, most planer adventurers are coming from magical worlds, which means they will have a much greater faith in magic than tech - it is what they know and rely on, after all ... so they'll be slow to adopt the sonic screwdriver when their normal toolkit works just fine.  </p>

<p>That said, I do incorporate Steampunk and other, fantastic versions of tech in my games.  There is a scientist in the Lady's Ward called "Brain Trust" who is a steampunk golem directed by a disembodied brain housed in its chest; who collects other brains in nodules on its back and connects them all through a complex system which allows him to access all their knowledge and memories.  I've used creatures from Iron Kingdoms, as well as other steamy or high science settings, throughout Sigil; even had Glitterboy operators.  Like someone else said, science fits the atmosphere of the planes only when it is strange and uncertain as the planes themselves.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>(The following ranty bit is in-character, just for effect.  ^_^  )</p>

<p>It's listening to Cagers getting like this that makes me glad I'm from a Prime.</p>

<p>"Tiny."  I do not think that word means what you think it means, Cager.  Tiny is a city wrapped around its own head a dozen miles through the long way, stuffed to the brim with two million people, playing at being a world.  Those primordial evils you're so cocky about, they rule nations that could swallow Sigil, cities just as big, and populations that could drown every planar here in a sea of orcs or abominations if the Lady's defenses were ever breached.</p>

<p>Of course they won't be -- this is Her place of power, and she's mighty strong here.  But when they win, they win bigger than one city, even a rich hub city.  They kill and loot and torment on a scale that would make the Blood War proud, and they grow fat and powerful off of it.  And then they turn their attention to the planes.  It only took one prime's sins to create Ravenloft, if you believe the tales.  And more than one evil prime has gotten what they wished for in putting their stamp on the planes: you may have heard of a little comedy pair by the name of Vecna and Orcus.</p>

<p>Gods aren't fighting holy wars over Sigil -- they're contesting worlds.  The biggest religious festival in Sigil never matched the sights you can see of the masses thronging the countryside for the Kumbh Mela of the Hindus or the screaming acreage of people at the high sacrifices for the Inca.  Even if some god managed to take over Sigil entire, they'd never be able to replicate that here: they can't.  This place doesn't have a Ganges or a Delphi.  Sure, you may say there's something like a Ganges on every world where the Hindu pantheon is powerful -- and it's a focus for a thrumming flow of devotion that puts anything this city can generate to shame.  Place is powerful, and this city's just one place.</p>

<p>I think the reason planars dismiss all those Primes is that they can't wrap their head around the size, or the sheer numbers.  Sigil, now, Sigil is an ambition a planar can handle.  You can be somebody in this fishbowl.  But you can't be a big someone on every one of those Primes, so you tell yourself that none of them are important.</p>

<p>Truth to tell, every fish picks his fishbowl.  You got one thing better than most primes -- you had a choice.  But don't think yours is so much better just because it has a view of all the others.</p>

<p>I got an estate to get back to.  Autumn's our apple season.  Y'all take care now.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">
