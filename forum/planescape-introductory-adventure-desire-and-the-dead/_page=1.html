         <p>Sure, I'll keep in touch. I'll also comment about any problems my players might have. It would be nice to have a map before the game, but I could also draw one myself with the help of that sigil map that was around here somewhere (the one with the street names and the locations, I think it was in a DeviantArt-Thread)<br />
Also, I'm currently writing a reference sheet with the names and short descriptions of all the NPCs because I tend to forget them during the game. I could host that, because I think many a DM will find  that useful.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Maps by next Monday it is then!</p>

<p>Thanks again for everyone’s critique – its really appreciated. My responses are below; Its a bit wordy (aren't I always?) but that’s only because I want to get this right:</p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-weight:bold">Krypter’s Comments</span></span></p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>I vote for having a modron at the artificer's place. They're another iconic part of the setting.</div></p>

<p>Dialexis also made this good point. Despite my love of elaborate steam-driven automata, a modron of some description will be replacing it in the next draft.  :cry: </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Alley Fighting is an excellent idea, and should go straight into the PSCS.</div></p>

<p>Glad you liked it. Will do.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Old Toad the slaad seems a little incongruent.  I agree that a hezrou would be better, maybe a crippled one to explain why he's running a sweatshop. </div></p>

<p>Getting a lot of resistance to the poor old green slaad… so more explanation is probably in order. There are two reasons I originally chose the race I did:</p>

<p>1) I wanted a powerful creature, but also to have a more morally ambiguous underworld boss than an obviously evil demon or devil. Also someone who was technically “good for the district” (or at least, far better than the alternative)</p>

<p>2) I wanted to use only <span style="font-style:italic">Monstrous Manual</span> creatures, to keep things simple for new DMs. </p>

<p>Now I know that 90% of DMs who’ll use the scenario will be experienced DMs (and experienced Planescape DMs to boot), but there seems to be a sizeable minority of people on the boards who have come to PS only through, and who don’t have years of experience or a horde of supplements (and I don’t have a horde of supplements either). </p>

<p>I’d actually added some more information on Old Toadface in the latest draft, to make him less a traditional ‘evil in all but alignment stat’ slaad – but the sweatshop idea is also simply too wonderful to pass up on. </p>

<p>Since Old Toadface doesn’t actually appear in the scenario, the simplest solution would seem to be removing ANY reference to his actual race. He becomes “a horrible giant toad-like monster” instead, free to be developed however people wish. We can leave off on Old Toadface’s secrets for the sequel.</p>

<p>The same applies to the <span style="font-style:italic">Proud Pariahs</span> gang.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>You may want to keep the classes simple. Unusual PrCs can be daunting to people who don't own the books, and may reduce the utility of the adventure. </div></p>

<p>Completely right. Specifically I’ve tried to avoid anything not in the Three Core Books or Planescape.com. That’s why Dabus and Cranium Rats don’t make an appearance.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>It’s barmies, not balmies. Normally I don't correct spelling but I saw this crop up a dozen times. </div></p>

<p>Right, in English ‘balmy’ <span style="font-style:italic">is </span>the correct spelling (although barmy is an acceptable alternate), which is why I used it. However, I happily admit that <span style="font-style:italic">barmy </span>is how PS spells it, so barmy it is (also there’s a whole sub-argument here about the Joculators apparently being obsessed with ointment…)</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>The only serious problem I have with <span style="font-style:italic">Desire and the Dead</span> is that there are too many encounters that overpower/overawe the PCs. Not one, not two, but three critical encounters in which the PCs will be intimidated and possibly beaten up. That is certainly realistic, but it may be extremely frustrating to players, especially ones unfamiliar with Planescape. In such situations players will often feel bullied and may turn against the DM. I would suggest a stronger resolution of the problem with the censer.</div></p>

<p>Okay, so the flippant answer is: </p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">“Welcome to the Planes, berk. Things do not work like they do on your cosy little Prime.” </span></p>

<p>To me that seems is pretty much the tagline of the setting and in the spirit of the other PS adventures I’ve been part of, but it doesn’t address the issue of annoyed and frustrated Player Characters, especially those used to a more satisfying/heroic close to an adventure. You raise a valid point. Let me talk first in general about the encounter structure, then I’ll address each encounter specifically. Quite possibly some of this will need putting in the actual scenario: </p>

<p>Although I’ve tried to balance out the adventure with encounter both above and below the EL of the group, there are a number of above average encounters. I feel that this is balanced by the relaxed timeline of the adventure. There’s almost no time when the PCs can’t retreat for a day or two to recover once their resources are depleted.</p>

<p>The Pyre District is an exception to this – it’s an adventure location in a “wilderness area” (albeit one only a mile wide). These encounter are more balanced.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">The Joculators: </span>These guys are tough because as far as the obvious plot goes, the Xaosetics are the main villains. Tracking these barmies down will likely be the action climax of the adventure (although weirdly, its in the middle of it). It’s entirely possible that the party never takes the <span style="font-style:italic">Thurible </span>or discovers Desire’s plan, although of course a good DM should probably wangle the game back on course. </p>

<p>I envision roughly three encounters with the Joculators: Probably one random encounter where the Xaosetics catch a PC or two unprepared; one against a more organised PC effort (where the Joculators are probably saved by Grimjaw’s intervention); and then a final reckoning at their hideout.</p>

<p>I know they're tough but I wanted to keep a central theme of “the Joculator menace” running through the first two Acts, to keep it from becoming just a series of random encounters.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Factol Ambergris: </span>My biggest defence of the Ambergris encounter is that in theory the PCs will never meet him. If they hang onto the Thurible (or discuss it with a respectable Dustman like Mother Xero rather than just selling it), then they’ll never get Ambergris’ ultimatum, or the halforc could come to them with a commission to find out who’s responsible instead. </p>

<p>And even if he arrives angry, the PCs won’t get a beating unless they physically attack him (he’s mentioned in the text as being almost immune to taunts).</p>

<p>I’ll update the encounter with Ambergris to include the possibility of him having a nicer meeting with the PCs, and what rewards he might offer in such circumstances.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Perhaps Eyes' Desire (is that with an apostrophe or without?) could be embarrassed in front of her higher ups and her plan revealed as having failed? Disgraced, she may be reassigned to another plane away from Sigil. The PCs think they've won...until someone even more devious shows up and tries again...</p>

<p>I love the storytelling resolution of this adventure but it may be too much for regular D&amp;D players and if the climax of the adventure ends up being the PCs filling out a useless police report it just wouldn't be an ending.</div></p>

<p>Actually I’m highly amused by the idea of ‘fading to black’ at the scenario’s end with PCs fruitlessly filling out endless police reports, but I take your point entirely. I think the <span style="font-style:italic">Ending The Adventure </span>section needs to be expanded to include giveing the PCs a proper ending (of some kind), more on the aftermath, and more on getting revenge on the principals (things like Eyes being censured by the Sensates if the PCs go public with their findings). </p>

<p>These are meant to be jumping off points for <span style="font-style:italic">future </span>adventures however and I'm not going to work anything up fully.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>PS: If you need my help I could assist with the following: editing, layout and possibly mapping.</div></p>

<p>Thanks for this, I’ll bare it in mind.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold"><span style="font-size:18px">Azriael’s comments</span></span></p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Personally I don't mind taking a few knocks, especially at low level, in a campaign because payback's a *!@#% once you gain a few more levels. I think it also depends on how the DM does it - I recommend reading Shemmy's storyhour 1 as an example of how PC's can still be given token rewards despite unbeatable (at the time) foes.</div></p>

<p>I agree, but as above I’ll look at the end of the scenario for ways to make it more satisfying for the PCs. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold"><span style="font-size:18px">Dialexis’ Comments</span></span></p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Yes, you definitely changed tracks from the Scrooge motif -your NPC treasure amounts are fine, but many of the non-NPC are too high…</div></p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>…That said, I don't think that they really need to be changed -since we have the other encounters like the barghest and doppleganger with "no" treasure (it is unlikely that the PCs will cut open her stomach and find the ring -though I love the flavor -awesome stuff). </div> </p>

<p>As you spotted, I’m varying the treasure allocations as described in the DMG. Hopefully it should all balance out in the end, with the ‘poor’ encounters balancing the ‘rich’ ones. Plus most of the rich encounters come with some kind of catch too – the nathri will want their icon back, selling the Thurible results in a visit from Ambergris, etc.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>About the bugbear's scythe: Simply reduce the amount that the NPC's will pay for it.  Lannis will only pay 1,000 gp for it -he's cheap and already lost the investment payed to the original locator.  The Dustmen will pay the normal price -i.e. half value.</div></p>

<p>This indeed seems more in line with the rules and the NPCs involved. Thanks for the catch, will do.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>(My biggest problem as a DM would be that I would want to run every single encounter since they are so cool!)</div></p>

<p>I get that too, but hopefully a DM will finish this scenario with a number of “ready to go” Hive Ward encounters they can use at any later point (and the complete Grey District for future use).</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>the gnoll has a wand, but can't use it since she can't cast divine spells (although she might still have it as treasure -which is fine -just wanted to point that out)</div></p>

<p>Whoops again. Another catch (clearly I was writing the section late at night...)</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Thus, this scene only presages what may later come (but we'll want to flesh out maybe a seal or symbol of the mercenaries -foreshadowing and all).  </div></p>

<p>I really like ‘em too - they are fellow adventurers, after all. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Do you want to flesh out the info on these two?</span> It’ll be easy to add a few details (prominent names and symbols and such) to foreshadow the later stuff.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Now, I do agree with the Worthy having the Modron "secretary" -for all the reasons I described long ago -in a post far away... (actually just earlier in the thread).</div></p>

<p>Yup, and as then, I have been persuaded - it makes much more sense for an introduction to Planescape (I just like <span style="font-style:italic">robots</span>, okay…  <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/lol.png" title="Laughing out loud" alt="Laughing out loud" class="smiley-content"/> ) </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Lower the DC for the sawed planks to a DC 15 and don't have the Otyugh already there, but have the trap's noise attract it in 1 round later.</p>

<p>Consider just having the carrion crawler have the grate even for the 2nd level PCs -its just too deadly otherwise -you get hit and fail and then attack and you are dead almost without fail.  And due to the restricted access, a party can't attack the thing at distance or gang up on it.  </div></p>

<p>Given the rather improvised nature of the traps in Gnarlybone’s lair, I think you’re probably right on all points, and that way Gnarlybone can melt the bars' latch as he flees; hopefully freeing the crawler and trapping the PCs inside his lair while he flees.</p>

<p>I originally stuck with 2nd level to make him inexperienced compared to the party’s Rogue, but as you may have guessed from my post, I wasn’t entirely happy.  His skills just aren’t up to scratch for the character I described. 3rd it is, then.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Also, one other error I picked out -a doppleganger's ECL is 8 -not 4.  Just something to consider and edit in your write-up there.</div></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Honestly, it was really late, I swear...</span> guess I misread the entry in my enthusiasm. I’ll dump the “may take on permanently” bit in his write-up (this is why posting in advance is vital!)</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline"><span style="font-weight:bold">Thanks very much to you all again for your comments! </span></span></p>

<p>Apols if I've missed anything; let me know and I'll reply to it. Otherwise <span style="font-style:italic">please do</span> keep picking me up on any major errors (like the barmy thing and floating apostrophes) or obvious mistakes (like saying you can play an ECL 8 monster in a 3rd level adventure). It’s what proof-reading is all about!</p>

<p>Hopefully I’ll sweep up all the minor errors in the last draft – either me or whichever Factol is in charge of ‘Adventure Editing’. Do we know who that will be? I think we are (slowly) approaching the stage where I’d like to get them involved on this.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>OK, I can agree with the argument that the slaad is better than a demon because not everyone will have the extra sourcebooks, but you'll need to create a convincing reason for why something as chaotic and wild as a slaad would be running something as orderly and commercial as a sweatshop. What do slaad care for money anyway? Leaving it up to the DM may indeed be the best solution.</p>

Me too, it would be very <span style="font-style:italic">Brazil</span>-like, but I'm trying to look at this adventure through the eyes of a PS novice who only has the core books and runs typical adventures that involve a bad guy and his eventual death. I agree that the Joculators should be tough opponents that may require several fights to take down. Perhaps you could rearrange the encounters so that the power-trip with Eyes' Desire takes place <span style="font-style:italic">before</span> the final battle with the Joculators? That way the PCs could feel powerless before the machinations of the Sensates yet still achieve their objective of cleaning up the Grey District at the end of the adventure. Eyes' Desire may still be out of reach but at least her plan has been neutralized for the moment. Just a suggestion.</p>

<p>One thing to remember is that as an introductory adventure its main purpose should be to make the Planescape campaign setting exciting and <span style="font-style:italic">enticing</span> to new DMs and players. If frustration is all they get then it'll be a big turn-off. Unless you plan to make this a trilogy, of course.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Thought that perhaps we could use some of the ideas thrown around about Old toad face in a later adventure if you liked. He'd appear as the lesser of two evils in a turf-fight type of scenario.</p>

<p>I loved the idea of the literal 'sweat shops' - kind of like the liquid agony extraction in BoVD (I once used a similar thing as a Baatezu conversion camp set up like the Milgram authority experiment) I thought that this could be run by the crippled Hezrou mentioned earlier who could have been trying to move in while Toad face is away.</p>

<p>As for the Hezrou I'm thinking of something like (warning obscure Buffy reference) Balthazar- the bloated demon/vampire in the tub in the 3rd series of Buffy. Basically immobile but operating through agents. Plus his CR could be modified by giving him levels in wizard or Psion to help counter the fact that he's pretty much helpless before a character with a bow.</p>

<p>This would tie in nicely with the "It's not great but it's better than the alternative" feel of the hive generally and the grey district specifically. I know this needs a lot more thought but I just had the idea and thought it was worth putting out there.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Actually I’m highly amused by the idea of ‘fading to black’ at the scenario’s end with PCs fruitlessly filling out endless police reports, but I take your point entirely. I think the Ending The Adventure section needs to be expanded to include giveing the PCs a proper ending (of some kind), more on the aftermath, and more on getting revenge on the principals (things like Eyes being censured by the Sensates if the PCs go public with their findings).</div>
Me too, it would be very <span style="font-style:italic">Brazil</span>-like, but I'm trying to look at this adventure through the eyes of a PS novice who only has the core books and runs typical adventures that involve a bad guy and his eventual death. I agree that the Joculators should be tough opponents that may require several fights to take down. Perhaps you could rearrange the encounters so that the power-trip with Eyes' Desire takes place <span style="font-style:italic">before</span> the final battle with the Joculators? That way the PCs could feel powerless before the machinations of the Sensates yet still achieve their objective of cleaning up the Grey District at the end of the adventure. Eyes' Desire may still be out of reach but at least her plan has been neutralized for the moment. Just a suggestion.</div></p>

<p>First encounter with the Joculators the PCs are caught off gurad and embarrassed.</p>

<p>The Second encounter, Grimjaw saves them, but they lose the Thurible and the PCs are able to track it back to Desire while the Joculators go underground and start planning something rash.</p>

<p>Third encounter is fought on even ground and is the climax after squaring off with Desire and should prevent the Joculators from doing something rash and very destructive.</p>

<p>Sounds like fun to me.</p>

<p></div></p>

<p>Yeah, that's right - and rule of threes as well! I think I need to cover this in more detail, probably in the Joculator section.</p>

<p>I'd actually not considered the possibility that the PCs confront Desire believing that she controls the Joculators - having got the <span style="font-style:italic">Thurible </span>(and maybe lost it again) but not defeated them. If they play it right, she <span style="font-style:italic">might </span>even throw "them a bone" (if they return the <span style="font-style:italic">Thurible</span> to her) by turning stag on the Jocs and lanning the PCs to their location (hoping they'll elininate the Joculator connection to her - or get eliminated themselves...)</p>

<p>That would make for an interesting ending... the villainess sets the PCs on her henchmen!</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">In Other News...</span></p>

<p>So my promise to have the map for Monday seems to have slipped...  :oops: </p>

<p>I should post in the next day or two however (defininitely by Friday). Bare in mind that it will be a rather rough map; the one I've used to accompany my DM notes rather than a finished product.</p>

<p>To make up for the delay, here are those last two random encounters for the Pyre District:</p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-weight:bold">11: Mad Tieflings, el 4</span></span></p>

<p>The PCs have the misfortune to come upon a band of mad tiefling beggars who eke out an existence in the rubble. The beggars immediately try to swarm the group, tearing off any possessions they can get their hands on. They’re also not adverse to a little cannibalism when hungry:</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">You don’t see the people at first, so caked are their clothes and faces in ash. They stare listlessly at you from corners and doorways and alcoves, huddled in bundles of rags. Poverty and wretchedness is all that unites them, otherwise no two look the same: They are mostly human, but here and their you see a set of yellowed fangs, budding horns, or eyes that glow like smouldering coals. Each is marked by a touch of Fiendish blood.</p>

<p>“Food…” one mutters, pointing at you. “Food!”</p>

<p>His weak cry is taken up by others, and a hungry gleam appears in their eyes. A forest of crude shivs suddenly appear in their hands: Improvised blades that are chipped, rusty, and fouled with who knows what.</p>

<p>“Food!” They cry, almost screaming with delight.</span></p>

<p>There are 12 beggars involved in the attack. Although others are present, they cower in the darkness and will not approach the PCs. They attack as a mob, trying to overwhelm one or two of the group, to loot and eat. They have nothing to lose and will fight until slain. Once half are incapacitated however, the rest turn their attentions to their fallen comrades.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Award PCs 30% less XP for this encounter, due to the limited resources of their foes (no armour and only a weak weapon) and the fact that they fight only until half of them are incapacitated. </span></p>

<span style="font-weight:bold">3: Smog Bank</span> - The party catches sight of a thick bank of choking smog drifting in from Lower Ward. Within 1d6x10 minutes it has covered the Grey District in choking black mist for a day and a night.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">4: Razorvine –</span> a loose cobble sends the character stumbling towards a patch of razorvine. Make a Ref Save, DC 12 or suffer 1d10 damage.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>But hey, at least now I'm considering it.... I may have to stick a sentence or two about the possibility into the DM's notes, but basically the setting is there for the PCs to play around in however they want.</p>

<p>On the other hand, they could always get forced back on track by Foctol Ambergris - just assume he learns what he needs from <span style="font-style:italic">Commune</span>/<span style="font-style:italic">Divination </span>etc.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Isn't it lovely when players aren't like that? At least they're not evil **shivers** One of my players in RHoD is a Machiavellian lawyer in RL.</p>

<p>Anyhow, I've set the deadline for everyone entering my game as the 19th and I should have them picked by the 20th. It looks like most of the party will end up being Clueless, as most of the players are, but I think its safe to say that there will be a cutter or two in the final party. Anyhow, feel free to take a look, and if anyone has any comments or advice, I'm open to it. One of the nice things about play-by-post is that we can all examine it at our leisure. </p>

         <p>Just FYI/FYE, we have planned a sequel to Desire and the Dead, which will go into Old Toadface and Eyes' Desire some more -it will be playable as a stand-alone module, or in conjunction with (Part 1).</p>

<p>Some things to consider with that said:</p>

<p>This helps Krypter's comments relative to "bad guys" win syndrome, as the PCs have a chance to take on -directly the Sensate.</p>

<p>Old Toadface will be a prominient player.  Back when we last discussed it, his identity was key -he is in fact a Hydroloth pretending to be a Slaad.  (and, like Azriael said, the "sweat-shop" takes on a whole new level of meaning).</p>

<p>Also of import, the "sequel" acts as a bridge to the larger planned campaign (which has Slaadi and Modron heavily involved -and by the end, nearly every plane and faction is introduced and touched).  </p>

<p>Ok, but back to the here-and-now.</p>

<p>Sorry about the absence (my planewalker account is having some minor issues).  </p>

<p>I can work up some proposals on the Joculators (I think these are some of the most important stats, so we really need some good feedback) -and will definitely get them by Saturday.  (I also have Rash's stats as promised, but will post afterwords so as not to derail?).</p>

<p>Relative to Armoury99's last encounter contributions (he's amazing, isn't he?).</p>

<p>The "hazards" seem great.  I like the beggar mob idea, but I think we can more elagantly apply the DMG II mob stats to make a far easier/cleaner job for the DM.  </p>

<p>(One doesn't need the DMG II to use the stats -if desired, I'll post the version -its not complicated, it actually simplifies -versus having a DM have to roll 12 times for the beggars -game grinder!</p>

<p>That said, great to hear from Flame Drake and Eldan -and that the games are starting up.  </p>

<p>Besides the Joculators and the map (I'll let A99 tackle that one), is there anything that you guys need now -or in the immediate future?</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><span style="font-style:italic">Well, here we are again! This time it’s the last part of the adventure, the lair of Fingers and the Joculators. </p>

<p>Despite the urban setting, ‘Blighthouse’ is actually much more of a standard dungeon adventure than the rest of </span>Desire and the Dead. <span style="font-style:italic">Encounter levels vary around the 3 mark, and although still tough the PCs will probably encounter the Joculators split up, and having eliminated at least 1 of their number before hand.</p>

<p>Both Fingers and the Jocs are having some work done on them for the next draft, but given that we have imminent playtesting, I thought it best to post everything I had and then update later. I’m also going to include a few lines in the adventure about customising these both sets of NPCs for a gaming groups’ level and style.<br />
 <br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Fingers </span>– I’m basically going with Rhys’ version of Fingers (both ‘ghoul’ and incense), but I have a slight reservaion: I’m wary of making Fingers a ghast – in my mind Ghasts represent a more dedicated and committed servant of evil, and so will be a less pathetic and sympathetic character, which was the idea behind him (remember we’d like the PCs to talk to Fingers if possible). While a ghoul could have been an innocent the victim of Ghoul Fever, a ghast is a ghoul whose dedication to evil results in increased power and a literal “stench of corruption.” That’s my only reservation as to race, but I also think that a class level (which is how I’d keep his CR at 3) would help to ‘humanise’ Fingers more and make him a viable ally after the adventure.</p>

<p>I’d like to get some other opinions on this – do people share my view of ghasts, or is that just in my head? And more importantly, am I just micromanaging the adventure with tiny little details best left to individual DMs?<br />
 <br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">The Joculators </span>– I’d have liked to use tieflings, who are otherwise almost entirely absent for the adventure, but they just don’t quite seem to fit. After some deliberation, I’ve gone with <span style="font-weight:bold">Chaonds</span> for these Joculators. This is because:</p>

<p>1. Their Alignment fit naturally with the Xaosetic ethos<br />
2. Their natural abilities fit with their jobs as jesters/acrobats<br />
3. Chaonds are purely PSCS creatures and its good to showcase them</p>

<p>As I said above however, I’m keen for DM’s to customise the Joculators for their own groups (using aasimars if the PCs are all evil, elves if they’re all dwarves, etc). In the latest draft, I’ve put together a bit more on the Joculators as a gang – these ones are now just a single band in a whole cavalcade of jestering xaosetics, many of which are former Xaosetics operating under a different name (much like the Dustmen of the Funerary Guild), and most of which were dedicated pranksters long before the Faction War. </p>

<p>Accordingly, everyone should go ahead and throw out some Joculator stats, and we can include ALL of them in the writeup of the gang – which will probably be a Planewalker article rather than in the scenario itself.</p>

<p>Another quick note on the Joculators – I’ve generally skipped giving them names, as the Joculators give a different moniker every time they’re asked for one. Since they have different spell lists here however, I have identified them by the name they initially gave Grimjaw the Githzerai, which is how he always refers to them.</p>

<p>Last thing, I think the scenario is building a nice Law/Chaos conflict... nice foreshadowing for the sequel!</span></p>

The party’s destination is at the very heart of the Pyre district:</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">This building seems to have once been a prosperous boarding house. The square surrounding it is relatively clear, containing only chunks of rubble and cobbles cracked by fire’s heat. The only other feature of the square is a blackened stone plinth, topped with a statue that’s been cut off at the knees.</p>

<p>The structure is two stories tall, although much of the roof seems to have fallen in. It’s streaked with soot and ashes, but seems to have survived the blaze reasonably intact. Time has taken its toll however, and the building is still a ruin. A strong even Light can be seen from behind the tattered shutters of the top floor however, right above the once grand entrance. The rest of the building looks dark and deserted.</p>

<p>A sagging wooden porch has survived the somehow, though it’s blackened and full of holes. Nailed to these crumbling remains is an old sign, wiped clear of the soot. Once it read ‘the White House Inn’ but has been vandalised and now says merely <span style="color:darkred"><span style="font-weight:bold">BLIGHTHOUSE</span></span>.</span></p>

<p>Blighthouse’s outer walls are built of Sigil’s ubiquitous grey stone, as are the interior walls and floor on ground level. Above this only the outer walls are stone. The upper storey floor and interior are crafted from warped and blackened wood. None of it looks particularly sturdy.</p>

<p>A section of stone wall has Hardness 7 and 80 hit points.<br />
The warped wooded walls have only Hardness 3 and 30 hit points.</p>

<p>The wooden floors also creak alarmingly, inflicting a -5 penalty on all <span style="font-style:italic">Move Silently </span>checks.</p>

<p>Unless mentioned otherwise all the doors are <span style="font-style:italic">wrecked wood </span>– warped, creaky, blackened by fire and mould and barely standing. None are locked unless this is mentioned in the specific room description. The doors have Hardness 3 and 5hps, and the DC to break them down is only 10 (12 if locked). </p>

<p>It’s almost pitch dark inside Blighthouse, so PCs will need to rely on Darkvision or artificial light. Rooms lacking shutters (or a roof, on the top floor) are slightly lighter; these areas only count as ‘shadowy’ for purposes of vision and the <span style="font-style:italic">Hide </span>skill.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">The Benefits of Random Chance</span></p>

<p>The Joculators are firm believers that random events control the life of everyone in the Multiverse, and the makeup of this encounter reflects their beliefs. There are several ways the scenario could play out, each determined by Random chance:</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">o </span>Unless the party takes preparations to catch or avoid them, there’s a 50% chance that the Joculators are absent from the tenement.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">o</span> If the Joculators are out, there’s a 50% chance that they return while the PCs are exploring the inn.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">o</span> If they are in residence, there’s a 50% chance that a Joculator is by a window and can make a Spot check to see the PC’s coming.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">o </span>If the Joculators are in residence when the PCs arrive, there’s a 50% chance that Grimjaw also arrives shortly afterwards.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">o </span>There’s a 50% chance that any complex plan the PC’s have is ruined by some accidental occurrence, bad timing, or other random chance.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">o </span>Make a Will Save (DC 15) for Fingers the Ghoul. If successful he is in residence and meditating. On a fail, Fingers is prowling The Pyres or Grey District, unable to contain himself. He returns 1d6 hours after the PCs arrive.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">o </span>If there is a great deal of noise in the Blighthouse or just outside for an extended period (DM’s discretion), then there’s a 50% chance that Officers Souby and Thacker rise from their middens to “subdue the area” (see Location 20 for details).</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Joculator Tactics </span>– <span style="font-style:italic">this section should probably be merged with DANCE OF THE JOCULATORS</span></p>

<p>The Xaosetics apply much the same strategy to defending themselves in their lair as they do on the streets – embarrass, incapacitate, and dance away. Of course this could change if the PCs have brutally murdered one or more of the troupe.</p>

<p>If they become aware of the PCs, one Joculator watches for them through the hole above the entrance hall (and holes in the floor above other rooms), while the second guards the top of the stairs, and the third peeks keeps an eye on the balcony roof while keeping an occasional eye on his partners. None of them are particularly stealthy, and will actually call out taunts, off-colour jokes, and witticisms at the PCs with fair regularity. </p>

<p>Potential strategies include:</p>

<p>o <span style="font-style:italic">Charm Person</span> – On the party’s warrior/leader.</p>

<p>o <span style="font-style:italic">Daze </span>- On anyone who’s balanced in a precarious position.</p>

<p>o <span style="font-style:italic">Grease </span>– especially if they see someone on the stairs or porch roof.</p>

<p>o <span style="font-style:italic">Minor Image</span> &amp; <span style="font-style:italic">Ghost Sounds </span>– to distract the party (such as combining their efforts to create a mock Sphere of Annihilation to chase them about)</p>

<p>o <span style="font-style:italic">Sleep </span>– as the PC’s charge them, or if someone is stood by or climbing out of a hole.</p>

<p>o Peeing on characters below them.</p>

<p>o Trying to burst through the rotten doors, to make an impressive entrance or exit.</p>

<p>o Dropping <span style="font-style:italic">Three Suns Prayer </span>incense on the PCs.</p>

<p>o Dropping their captive Darkmantle on a PC.</p>

<p>o Pushing people down holes in the floor.</p>

<p>o Using any equipment belonging to the PCs that was stolen or captured earlier.</p>

<p>o Shouting <span style="font-style:italic">“I surrender!” </span>to any obvious paladins or lawful folk, then capering around getting in their way.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Captured!</span><br />
Depending on their level, the party might find themselves on the wrong end of some Sleep spells and captured. The Joculators will find this particularly amusing if the PCs had tracked them down in revenge for a previous attack.</p>

<p>If the Joculators capture the whole group, they will rob them of their weapons and armour (which will be stored in Yip’s room (area 11), bind them all up in a large fishing net, and then dangle them from the plinth in the square. They will then make endless fun of the heroes from the top of the porch, throwing various objects at them as well.  Less amusingly (for the party), a pack of hungry wild dogs also gathers at the foot of the monument. </p>

<p>See Encounter 10 for statistics.</p>

<p>Characters will need to disentangle themselves from the net and climb down before fighting the dogs; if they fall, they will take 1d6 damage. Only if the party manages a persuasive plea for help them will the Joculators help – perhaps by throwing down bits of equipment, possibly just by shouting encouragement. The amount of Joculator aid (if any) depends on the party’s prior relationship with them… You reap what you sow.</p>

<p>The DM should adjust the XP award of the dogs by +10 to +30% depending on how much of a disadvantage their unequipped state is (a party of monks and psionicists would be in less troubled than average, for example).</p>

<p>See DANCE OF THE JOCULATORS for more information.</p>

<p> <br />
<span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-weight:bold">Locations</span></span></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline"><span style="font-weight:bold">1: Porch</span></span></p>

<p>The porch groans like a wounded man as you step onto it, and a faint snow of ashes trickle down from the holes in its roof. </p>

<p>The skeletal remains of ironbound doors and a web of nailed planks block your way. A small person might be able to wriggle through the remains without disturbing them, but it also looks like a good kick would send the whole thing tumbling down.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">The porch roof:</span> The DC to clamber onto the porch is only DC 7, but it looks distinctly creaky and unsafe. Anyone clambering across its roof has a 10% chance each round of causing a 5ft section around them to collapse, dumping them on the ground with a 10ft fall. This chance rises to 50% if the character’s total weight is 200lbs or more.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Getting in: </span>Examining the skeletal remains of the doors reveal a cheap padlock and chain securing what’s left of the doors on the outside, rusted to a single solid mass. The doors can also be forced off with a Strength check of DC 16, but the clang of falling metal will certainly alert the inhabitants. Character can also squeeze inside without disturbing the doors with a successful Escape Artist check, DC 15.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline"><span style="font-weight:bold">2: Entrance Hall</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">A wide rectangular hall awaits you, covered in soot. You can just make out the shape of fittings and the remains of decorations; once this place was fine and impressive, surely cared for by many servants. Now only a strange smell greets you – a powerful mix of incense and human waste.</p>

<p>On the opposite wall stand two large doorways, although only one seems to have any doors hanging from it. The floor immediately in front of the entrance has collapsed, leaving a gaping hole; there is a similar wide hole in the ceiling as well, covered by a carpet in the room above. Light filters through its threadbare fibres.</span></p>

<p>HAZARD: Any character who charges in through the entrance (such as making a Break check against the doors) will tumble into the hole unless they make a Ref Save, DC 20. They will take 1d6 damage and find themselves in area 21. Characters above can look down into that area. Character’s who fall all the way from the Upper Parlour will take 3d6 damage.</p>

<p>Closer examination of the chamber will reveal nothing of use, although all the shutters have been nailed closed. A Spot check at DC 20 (10 if using bright light) reveals a number of marks in the debris. If a character examines the dirt for tracks, have them make a Survival roll:</p>

<ul class="bb-list" style="list-style-type:circle;"><span style="font-style:italic">DC 10: Numerous creatures have used this hallway.
DC 13: Some of the tracks are old, some recent. <br />
DC 18: The tracks are very varied: small animals, general vermin, and several sets of booted feet - and something that walks on pointed stilts?</span></ul>

<p>CREATURE (EL 1): As the PCs approach the archway, they have a rather startling encounter: </p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">The empty doorframe ahead is suddenly rimmed in golden fire, and bright light fills the room* - it reveals a blank white void and a figure flying out of it onto the floor. It rolls to a halt on the before you in a snarling crouch. Behind it, you glimpse a number of small black dots rushing up in pursuit, but the portal closes before they get close enough to identify.</span></p>

<p>*If the PCs are currently in darkness or using only a very dim light (such as a shuttered lantern), then treat the sudden change in light as a Flare spell affecting everyone in the room.</p>

<p>Tumbling into the room is a female Githyanki warrior in breastplate and sword. Broken chains jangle from her wrists. Everyone – including the Githyanki – is surprised. On her next action however, she attacks the nearest person with her greatword. Anyone who has a higher initiative check than Vash’anwé can make a Sense Motive check (DC 18) to notice that she looks as tired and scared as she does angry.</p>

<p>This is Vash’anwé, a young Githyanki ‘rebel’ on the run. She’s an exile who supported the wrong side in one of the many internal battles of her people following the death of Queen Vlaakith, and is fleeing a band of Knights. She’s panicked and angry, but after her initial attack will seek only to escape. She’ll target any Githzerai in the group over other characters, but after fighting her way through the party, she’ll flee.</p>

<p>Possessions: Breastplate, Masterwork Greatsword. Vash’anwé is also wearing a pair of manacles around her wrists, although the chain that runs between them is broken.</div></p>

<p>Is subdued, Vash’anwé can eventually be persuaded that the PCs mean her no harm, and will depart in peace to make her own way in the Cage. She fills the stereotypical image of the violent and xenophobic Githyanki, and if she makes it out of the Pyre District alive she will be an unwelcome addition to the Grey District and just the sort of basher the Voices don’t want around. The PCs will likely have to deal with her again later on.</p>

<p>It’s possible that this battle may alert both Fingers and the Joculators (if present) to the party’s presence. </p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline"><span style="font-weight:bold">3: Lounge</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">The ravaged remains of upholstered chairs stand in this room, their leather torn and their exposed stuffing guts covered with mould. All the other furniture has been deliberately smashed up and used to start a fire beneath the window at some point. It is otherwise empty.</span></p>

<p>If anyone takes the time to look, they’ll notice on an appropriate <span style="font-style:italic">Survival </span>check (DC 15) or druidic ability that several of the mushrooms growing in here are edible. The spider-webs in the corners of this room are also laced with a slick fuzz called “webmoss” that has antiseptic properties. Gathering the webs produces 1d6 ‘doses’ that can be added to the bandages in a first aid kit, adding +1 to any Healing checks made with them.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline"><span style="font-weight:bold">4: Stairway</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">A blackened staircase sweeps up to the next floor. Unlike the rest of the interior there are few signs of fire here; this chamber seems to have escaped almost untouched by flame, if not by time.</span></p>

<p>The stairs are serviceable, but as creaky as the floorboards upstairs (-5 to <span style="font-style:italic">Move Silently </span>checks). If the Joculators are aware of the PC’s presence, then anyone climbing the stairs is in for a surprise (see location 10)</p>

<p>CREATURE: Characters who approach the archway to Area 2 will trigger the portal and encounter Vash’anwé the githyanki (see area 2 for details).</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline"><span style="font-weight:bold">5: Cloakroom</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">The door to this small chamber has been smashed open, revealing a cloakroom full of empty pegs. Whatever it contained has long ago been looted.</span></p>

<p>There’s nothing of interest here except a low bench that tired characters could sit on. </p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline"><span style="font-weight:bold"><br />
6: Dining Room</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Broken windows surround this room, blocked now only by mouldy boards nailed haphazardly across naked frames. Debris and muddy ash covers everything, piled around a huge blackened table that’s broken down the middle. In one corner the ceiling has collapsed, leaving a slope of rubble and beams.</span></p>

<p>CREATURE (EL 4): Present in the room is Mister Click, the enterprising ettercap:</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Clinging to the wall beneath the ceiling gap is a nightmarish creature: Its body is roughly humanoid but its face is a terrible insectile visage. A voluminous cloak hangs from its shoulders, but does little to hide its awful form. Two massive rats thrash and wriggle in a web that stretches from the creature’s underside - a third rat kicks weakly in one of the beast’s claws. The creature clicks its mandibles and grinds serrated jaws at you, pulling the entangled vermin closer.</span></p>

<p>This is Mister Click the ettercap, a local resident (he’s actually giving a jaunty hello in the description above). Click lives in the Pyre District because of his eating habits, which include the still-living meat of intelligent races. As a connoisseur of flesh, Click has become something of an expert on anatomy and serves as a healer for the monsters of the area, among whom he is well respected.</p>

<p>* +4 racial bonus on Craft (trapmaking), Hide, and Spot checks. They have a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks and can always choose to take 10 on Climb checks, even if rushed or threatened. Heal skill includes synergy bonus for Knowledge (Anatomy). Mister Click gets a +4 bonus to Bluff checks to communicate using gestures and sign language, as this is his much practised normal method of communication with most other creatures.</p>

<p>Possessions: Black leather doctor’s bag containing a masterwork healing kit, a half-eaten dire rat, and the following potions: Barkskin, Bear’s Endurance, and four potions of Cure Light Wounds.</p>

<p>Poison (Ex): Injury, Fortitude DC 15, initial damage 1d6 Dex, secondary damage 2d6 Dex. The save DC is Constitution based and includes a +2 racial bonus.</p>

<p>Web (Ex): An ettercap can throw a web eight times per day. This is similar to an attack with a net but has a maximum range of 50 feet, with a range increment of 10 feet, and is effective against targets of up to Medium size. The web anchors the target in place, allowing no movement.</p>

<p>An entangled creature can escape with a DC 13 Escape Artist check or burst the web with a DC 17 Strength check. The check DCs are Constitution-based, and the Strength check DC includes a +4 racial bonus. The web has 6 hit points, hardness 0, and takes double damage from fire.</p>

<p>Ettercaps can also create sheets of sticky webbing from 5 to 60 feet square. They usually position these to snare flying creatures but can also try to trap prey on the ground. Approaching creatures must succeed on a DC 20 Spot check to notice a web, or they stumble into it and become trapped as though by a successful web attack. Attempts to escape or burst the webbing receive a +5 bonus if the trapped creature has something to walk on or grab while pulling free. Each 5-foot-square section has 6 hit points, hardness 0, and takes double damage from fire.</p>

<p>An ettercap can move across its own sheet web at its climb speed and can determine the exact location of any creature touching the web.</div></p>

<p>Click is happily feasting on the Dire Rat nest that lives in the area, and isn’t looking for trouble. If attacked, he’ll web opponents and clamber up onto the floor above before making his escape. If the PCs persist in attacking him however, he will consider them fair game.</p>

<p>If approached with <span style="font-style:italic">Diplomacy</span>, Mister Click will respond with incongruous courtesy and politeness, like any friendly professional. He understands Planar Common, but can only get his mandibles around the clicking language of ettercaps and monstrous spiders, and must otherwise communicate by sign language. He’ll happily perform basic medical services for the PCs; he can treat them for poison, disease, and simple wounds in exchange for appropriate recompense. He doesn’t except coin however, only barter (preferably an interesting creature to dissect and eat). He maintains strict neutrality to the squabbles of the area however, and won’t become directly involved in PCs battles against the Joculators or Fingers the ghoul.</p>

<p>CREATURE (EL 3): If Click is absent or driven off by the PCs, the dire rat pack (9 of the creatures) will re-emerge into the room, defending their territory from any intruders:</p>

<p>TREASURE: Digging around in the stones will reveal the bones of a nathri, and his sack of looted goods. Although the purloined wood and cloth has rotted to uselessness, the sack also contains a solid silver tea service worth 500gps (weighs 40lbs).</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline"><span style="font-weight:bold">7: Kitchen</span></span></p>

<p>The door only opens a crack before banging to a halt against a pile of debris. It requires a STR check, DC 15 to force open.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">The whole ceiling of this chamber has collapsed, covering the room in rubble and debris. From the utensils rusted to its walls and mould-covered clumps overflowing from its shelves, it appears that this was once a kitchen. </span></p>

<p>A search of the room reveals a mouldy human foot, complete with a nice (but solitary) tan and green boot, covered with leaf designs (see TREASURE below) and some Dire Rat droppings. In one corner is a dumb waiter and winch, designed to bring goods up from the cellar (area 18). Fitting in the elevator or clambering down the shaft requires an Escape Artist check (DC 10) and a Climb check, DC 5.</p>

<p>TREASURE: On the severed foot is a <span style="font-style:italic">Boot of Elvenkind</span>. The other boot is among the junk in the Upper Parlour (location 12)</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline"><span style="font-weight:bold">8: Back Entrance</span></span></p>

<p>A small square chamber awaits you, scattered with ash and mud. In one corner huddles a porter’s snug, in the other a spiral stone staircase. A passageway leads further into the building; fire blackened and scattered with debris.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Getting In: </span>These doors are sturdier and more intact than the front ones, and although streaked with soot they are still firm and strong. A large lock secures it shut, old and a bit rusty but recently made serviceable. There are also two tiny peepholes, one at eye level of medium creatures, the other set for a size small person.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">The Back Doors: </span>Hardness 5, 15hp. Break DC 25 (locked). <span style="font-style:italic">Pick Lock </span>DC 20.</p>

<p>Once they have gained entry, the PCs can make the same search for tracks here as they can in the Entrance Hall. See location 2 for details.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic"><span style="font-weight:bold">UPPER FLOOR</span></span></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline"><span style="font-weight:bold">9: Common Room</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">The far side of this room is clearly recognisable as an inn’s common room, complete with pallet beds and foot-chests. Immediately in front of the door however, the floor has collapsed leaving a gaping hole. Whatever furnishings that portion had have plunged into the room below.</span></p>

<p>TRAP/HAZARD: Anyone charging into this room will find themselves falling through into the Kitchen (area 7), taking 1d6 damage unless they make a Ref Save at DC 20. The hole covers the first 20ft of the room, with only a few inches of floorboard hugging the wall to either side. It takes a Balance check (DC 15) to carefully negotiate them, but every round there is a 10% chance that it gives way, plunging the PC into the kitchen as above (rising to 50% if the character weighs more than 200lbs).</p>

<p>Of the three small chests remaining intact, two contain only mouldy clothes and a few ruined personal items, but the third is far more interesting.</p>

<p>TRAP (EL 3): The third chest contains a small box of reinforced wood, secured by a small internal lock (DC 30). Its Break DC is 19, and it has Hardness 5, and 10hps. It’s also protected by a Burning Hands trap: </p>

<p>Burning Hands Trap: CR 3; magic device; proximity trigger (alarm); automatic reset; spell effect (burning hands, 5th-level wizard, 5d4 fire, DC 11 Reflex save half damage); Search DC 26; Disable Device DC 26.</p>

<p>Inside the padded interior of the chest is a large flag, depicting the conjunction of two curving, bladed designs in gold in red (the symbol of the Revolutionary League) Beneath it is a masterwork-quality disguise kit, a stack of pamphlets, a pile of balaclavas, and six ceramic jars - each wax sealed and marked with the Anarchist heraldry in bright paint. These contain Alchemical Fire. Written on the pamphlets are proclamations against the ‘Oppressors of Sigil’ and an urging for the people to rise up and take back the streets from the tyrants who have enslaved them.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">- maybe add something else nice nut not too good to this horde?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic"><span style="font-weight:bold">Scaling the adventure: </span>Lower the ‘Caster Level’ of the trap to the average party level +2</span></p>

<p>	<br />
<span style="text-decoration:underline"><span style="font-weight:bold">10: Landing</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">A wide corridor runs off from the stairs, sporting numerous exits. A few strands of carpet and cracked ceramic vases flank each of the doors off it. The smell of incense is strong up here.</span></p>

<p>If the party has not alerted the Joculators to their presence, then they will also find a large stone head balanced precariously over the top step, glaring down at the stairway with an ugly devilish face.</p>

<p>TRAP/CREATURE: At the top of the stairway (out of sight from the floor below) is the large stone head of a devil (a Barbazu in fact). It’s actually the head of the statue from the square outside, but the Joculators have placed it here as a trap. If touched by a living creatures, it shouts <span style="font-style:italic">“Fe Fi Fo, Fum!” </span>(a <span style="font-style:italic">Magic Mouth </span>spell). The head radiates weak enchantment magic because of the spell upon it. </p>

<p>The Joculators plan to push the stone head down the stairs at any approaching creatures. If they have alerted the Xaosetics, one of them hides behind the head ready to push it down the stairs at anyone coming up (and setting off the Magic Mouth as they do so). </p>

<p>If it comes bouncing down the stairs, anyone in its path must make a Ref Save (DC 15) of be struck for 1d6 damage. Anyone failing their save by 10pts or more also falls off the stairway entirely, taking an additional 1d6 damage if they were more than halfway up.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline"><span style="font-weight:bold"><br />
11: Guest Room</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">This small chamber contains a four-poster bed and a large wardrobe. The frame of a painting hangs on one wall, but the canvas itself has been crudely cut out. A pile of rags decorates the bed, which is covered in animal hairs. A strong musky smell wafts off them, mingling with the already cloying scent of mould and incense.</span></p>

<p>This is the lair of Yip the manic dire weasel, although he spends most of the time in the Upper Parlour taunting the Darkmantle. Here the Joculators will stash the PC’s possessions, if they manage to capture them. If they are here for any length of time, such possessions will all be chewed up and covered in pungent weasel urine and shed hairs.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline"><span style="font-weight:bold">12: Upper Parlour</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Junk is piled in every corner of this room. Black robes and funerary gear is mixed in with all the rubbish. Unlike the rest of the upper floor, some carpeting seems to have survived, though it is sagging and threadbare.</span></p>

<p>Depending on circumstances, they may also notice the following:</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Squashed into a large cage hanging from the ceiling is a leathery creature that seems to be mostly a mass of twitching tentacles. Running round and around beneath the cage yipping manically is a large weasel, almost four feet long.</span></p>

<p>The creature in the cage is a captive Darkmantle, which the Joculators are thinking of involving in their next prank (see ‘tactics’ below). The dire weasel is ‘Yip’ (their pet), which will attack any unfamiliar creature that enters this room, barking loudly as it does.</p>

<p>Attach (Ex): A dire weasel that hits with its bite attack latches onto the opponent’s body with its powerful jaws. An attached dire weasel loses its Dexterity bonus to AC and thus has an AC of 12. An attached dire weasel can be struck with a weapon or grappled itself. To remove an attached dire weasel through grappling, the opponent must achieve a pin against the creature.</p>

<p>Blood Drain (Ex): A dire weasel drains blood for 1d4 points of Constitution damage each round it remains attached.</div></p>

<p>* +4 racial bonus on Listen and Spot checks. These bonuses are lost if its blindsight is negated. The creature’s variable coloration gives it a +4 racial bonus on Hide checks.</p>

<p>Darkness (Su): Once per day a darkmantle can cause darkness as the darkness spell (caster level 5th). It most often uses this ability just before attacking.</p>

<p>Improved Grab (Ex): To use this ability, a darkmantle must hit a Large or smaller creature with its slam attack. It can then attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking an attack of opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it attaches to the opponent’s head and can constrict.</p>

<p>Constrict (Ex): A darkmantle deals 1d4+4 points of damage with a successful grapple check.</p>

<p>Blindsight (Ex): A darkmantle can “see” by emitting high-frequency sounds, inaudible to most other creatures, that allows it to ascertain objects and creatures within 90 feet. A silence spell negates this ability and effectively blinds the darkmantle.</div></p>

	<br />
TREASURE: There’s a lot of stuff in the Joculator lair, but little of it would qualify as treasure to a respectable adventurer: Sorting through the junk will eventually produce a ladder, three books of torrid comedy poetry, a barrel of fish, 102 items suitable in juggling (beanbags, batons, torches, meat cleavers) seven sacks of marbles and caltrops, a dozen various items of funerary gear, and enough outfits, costume jewellery, and generally useful items to be worth 1d10 x 1d10 gps if the PCs are prepared to cart it through the Pyre District in wheelbarrows and to market (the items weight a total of 10 x their value in lbs).</p>

<p>Also present are numerous purses and pouches “borrowed” by the Joculators over the last few weeks. Their contents add up to: 36gp, 187sp, and 690cps. About half this money was stolen from the folk of the Grey District, the rest was acquired elsewhere.</p>

<p>Among the junk are three <span style="font-style:italic">Potions of Protection From Law</span>, an <span style="font-style:italic">Elixir of Love</span> (although it’s labelled “healing, plenty good!”), a <span style="font-style:italic">Wand of Prestidigitation</span> (24 charges remaining) – each marked with the quartered smiling face heraldry used by the Joculators. There is also a single <span style="font-style:italic">Boot of Elvenkind</span> (matching the one in the kitchen below). There’s also a small collection of thunderstones and tanglebags used in pranks (1d6 of remaining each).</p>

<p>And finally, there are 3d6 packets of <span style="font-style:italic">Three Suns Prayer</span> incense.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline"><span style="font-weight:bold">13: Guest Room</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">This chamber contains a four-poster bed and a large wardrobe. The walls, floor, ceiling, and furniture have all been daubed with multiple layers of coloured paint. The overall effect is as if a rainbow exploded in this room. A brush and pot sits on the bed.</span></p>

<p>CREATURE: If the PCs somehow enter this room without alerting the Joculators (such as sneaking in through the window), this room is occupied by one of their number, meditating on the beauty of chaos and idly flinging more paint onto the walls.</p>

<p>TREASURE: The paints are actually a set of Nolzur’s Marvellous Pigments, although there’s only 200 cubic feet worth of paint remaining.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline"><span style="font-weight:bold">14: Guest Bedroom</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">The blackened frame of bed and furniture lies here, in a pile of debris that’s clearly been sorted through many times. Animals and squatters have also used the room over the years, and the smell of waste is palpable despite the empty window frame.</span></p>

<p>This room is empty of anything of interest.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline"><span style="font-weight:bold">15: Guest Bedroom</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">The door to this chamber has been nailed shut with several boards, and painted over the top are several barely identifiable scrawls. The legible ones read DANGER, KEEP OUT, and ABSOLUTELY NO TREASURE IN HERE! </span></p>

<p>This chamber resembles Area 14, although its roof has fallen in, leaving it mostly open to the sky. </p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Squatting here amidst the cloying black mud is the most scrawny and hideous bird you have ever seen; it looks like a large bald turkey, but with a malformed head and a long naked tail that flicks about behind it. Once it had wings, but these have been clipped off, leaving only twitching stumps. It mews in a pathetic voice, then scrabbles to its feet and makes for the open door. Behind it trails a leather leash, connected to a green hide collar that is studded with tiny pale stones.</span></p>

<p>The beast as actually a cockatrice. </p>

<p>Petrification (Su): Creatures hit by a cockatrice’s bite attack must succeed on a DC 12 Fortitude save or instantly turn to stone. The save DC is Constitution-based. Cockatrices have immunity to the petrification ability of other cockatrices, but other petrification attacks affect them normally.</div></p>

<p>The cockatrice was locked up here by the Joculators, who found it wondering the streets, escaped pet of some gruesome alley lord. It immediately tries to escape, cawing loudly as it runs for the door and attacking anyone who gets in its way. Its slaad-hide collar is studded with cheap pearl shards, worth 100gp. </p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">DM Note:</span> Silent Brom has a Stone to Flesh scroll that the party might use to free a petrified companion (providing they think to ask and Brom thinks the PC is worth saving...) If for any reason the PCs are not on good terms with him, Protector Nymon can acquire one for them at the price of only 1,650gp.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline"><span style="font-weight:bold">16: Collapsed Guest Bedroom</span></span></p>

<p>This bedchamber is identical the Location 14, except that its floor has partially collapsed, allowing access to the Dining Room below (area 6) by means of a sloping beam, some rubble, and some disturbingly large strands of sticky web. (Climb DC 5). Character’s who peer down into the hole will see the hideous Mister Click staring back at them. </p>

<p>See Area 6 for more details.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic"><span style="font-weight:bold">THE CELLARS</span></span></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline"><span style="font-weight:bold">17: Stairway</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">The spiral stair leads down into a panelled corridor, although most the wood has been stripped away, leaving only rough grey stone slick with slime and moisture. A rusty chain hangs from the ceiling, but the lantern which once adorned it is gone. </p>

<p>A foul animal smell pervades this whole area.</span></p>

<p>A <span style="font-style:italic">Survival </span>check at DC 15 identifies the odour as guano and damp fur (DC 25 to identify it as probably belonging to bats). The stench increases as the party makes its way down the corridor. At the end of it is a pair of double doors, originally of sturdy construction. They are still firmly locked but their lower halves have rotted away entirely, allowing even armoured creatures to slip easily beneath them.</p>

<p>Warped and broken double doors: <br />
Hardness 5, HP 8<br />
Break DC 14</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline"><span style="font-weight:bold">18: Store Room </span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">One corner of the ceiling is bent alarmingly, as if under a great weight, but otherwise the chamber seems sound. It was clearly a major storeroom of some kind, and the rotted remains of food and supplies lie scattered around you. In a corner to your left under the cracked and sagging ceiling is a small square alcove, backed with wood.</p>

<p>In the far corner, the stone floor has been churned up, like freshly ploughed earth. Sat happily in the centre of this mudhole is a pot-bellied creature made of earth and slime, with rough features similar to some orcish breed. It has a beard of earth, stony fangs, and its black eyes glitter like lumps of obsidian.</span></p>

<p>This is <span style="font-weight:bold">‘Sublune of the Third Great Delve’</span> – a playful Earth Mephit who’s decided to make the cellar into his temporary lair.</p>

<p>Change Size (Sp): Once per hour, an earth mephit can magically change its size. This works just like an enlarge person spell, except that the power works only on the earth mephit. This is the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell.</p>

<p>Fast Healing (Ex): An earth mephit heals only if it is underground or buried up to its waist in earth.</p>

<p>Possessions: Sablume has amassed quite a horde: 800 copper pieces, 90sp, 12gp, and a collection of quartz crystals worth 300gp. All are scattered about him in the mud. His Wand of Melf’s Acid Arrow is of seemingly primitive construction: a clay shaft hung with rhubarb leaves and the skin of snakes, but effective nonetheless. It has 6 charges remaining. He uses his Wand against enemies, or if he’s just overly annoyed. Sablune has long since lost track of how many charges it contains.</div></p>

<p>Sablune presents himself as a “Lord of the Earth Realm”, only deigning to speak to the likes of the PCs because the other company in these parts of despicably low character. Providing that the party panders to this conceit, Sablune will be quite forthcoming. He knows quite a lot about Blighthouse and its current inhabitants, but to get it the party will have to bow and scrape as if dealing with a Prince of the Dao.</p>

<p>Sablune claims that the Joculators are jesters in his employ, Mister Click his personal physician, and Fingers but a lowly wretch and feeble servant. He has similar opinions on anyone the PCs bring up in conversation, regardless of how ridiculous and contradictory his stories nay be (for example, he claims that the bat swarm are mounts for his royal legion of Jermaline cavalry). </p>

<p>Sablune knows where both Fingers and the Joculators call kip, if the PCs ask nicely enough. If they annoy Sablune however, he directs them to the Midden Room (area 20), with whatever lie he thinks most likely to get them to go there.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline"><span style="font-weight:bold">19: Corridor</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">This corridor stinks of guano which is splattered across the walls and floor. Its source is a living carpet of fur and leathery wings; from the ceiling hangs a massive flock of bats.</span></p>

<p>The swarm of bats reacts instantly to any disturbance by flocking around biting and scratching, with a deafening communal shriek. Sneaking past the bats without disturbing them requires a Move Silently check, DC 21</p>

<p>The swarm deals 1d6 points of damage to any creature whose space it occupies at the end of its move.</p>

<p>Distraction (Ex): Any living creature that begins its turn with a swarm in its space must succeed on a DC 11 Fortitude save or be nauseated (DMG, p301) for 1 round.<br />
 <br />
Wounding (Ex): Any living creature damaged by a bat swarm continues to bleed, losing 1 hit point per round thereafter. Multiple wounds do not result in cumulative bleeding loss. The bleeding can be stopped by a DC 10 Heal check or the application of a cure spell or some other healing magic.<br />
 <br />
Blindsense (Ex): A bat swarm notices and locates creatures within 20 feet. Opponents still have total concealment against the bat swarm (but swarm attacks ignore concealment).</div></p>

<p>If defeated, the bats make for the stairway and flutter all about the ground floor until they find a way out.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline"><span style="font-weight:bold">20: Midden</span></span></p>

<p>This chamber contains two long stone troughs, where in previous cycles the inhabitants of the White House Inn disposed of waste and harvested mushrooms. Now the troughs are overflowing with toadstools and hairy fungi. Only vermin would find a feast here now.</p>

<p>CREATURE: Anyone who enters the room will discover more than they bargained for: Buried in each stone midden trough is the body of Harmonium officer in rusty armour, which animates and attacks if anyone moves within 5ft.</p>

<p>It takes 1 round for the creatures to fully emerge from the middens, although this will be a surprise round unless the PCs are aware of their presence. The wights are quite vocal as they advance on enemies, and in a gurgling voice will formally charge the PCs with the crimes of free will and non-conformity, and issue a sentence of death.</p>

<p>Authority (sp): Greater Command 1/day (DC 17) once a day as a 4TH level cleric.</p>

<p>Create Spawn (Su): Any humanoid slain by a wight becomes a wight in 1d4 rounds. Spawn are under the command of the wight that created them and remain enslaved until its death. They do not possess any of the abilities they had in life. Unlike normal Wights, this power works only on Lawful opponents.</p>

<p>Energy Drain (Su): Living creatures hit by a wight’s slam attack gain one negative level. The DC is 14 for the Fortitude save to remove a negative level. For each such negative level bestowed, the wight gains 5 temporary hit points.</p>

<p>Unit Tactics (ex): +1 circumstance bonus to attack rolls and AC against a target for every character with this feat (including this character) threatening it.</div></p>

<p>Officers Sourby and Thacker fought in the hardheads’ brutal house to house skirmishing against the Enemies of Peace, even as the streets burned around them. They were eventually killed and their bodies dumped in the White House’s cellar, but the pair were so filled with violent hate for their foes that even death has failed to cool their anger. The pair have risen again as Wights. </p>

<p>Normally the pair remain in their midden troughs, but whenever noise and disturbance in the Blighthouse or surrounding area gets too great, they emerge to “restore order” to the area - by prowling it for victims. Thankfully none of their victims have been Lawful, or an army of wights could be infesting the Pyres.</p>

<p>The pair still firmly believes that they are serving officers in the Harmonium, but their beliefs have become warped and insane. They now see harmony and conformity only in the utter obedience of mindless undead. Free will is a symptom of a disease called life – and they are the cure!</p>

<p>TREASURE: Although he doesn’t use it in combat, Thacker has a ceremonial shortsword strapped to his side, in a rotted wooden scabbard. Embossed on the blade are the words “To Officer Thacker, Mover Three of the Harmonium, for outstanding service in the Outer Planes.”</p>

This chamber was once a wine cellar, although the racks have collapsed and a sea of mould and bottle-shards is all that remains of their contents. </span></p>

<p>If the PCs look in the alcove to their left, or look down from Area 2, use the following description:</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">This alcove is filled with rubble from the floors above, and has only a gaping hole for a ceiling. Stinking piles of blek have been poured onto it from above, and fungus and toadstools sprout from the hideous mass like a miniature forest. Thankfully the stench of incense is so strong here, it blocks the smell somewhat.</span></p>

<p>CREATURE: Fingers the Ghoul is the only resident of this dismal abode. Normally he sits and meditates on the stinking mound, muttering to himself, at other times he wanders the streets muttering to himself, drawn by his unholy hunger. </p>

<p>Make a Will Save (DC 13) for Fingers the Ghoul. If successful he is in residence and meditating. On a fail, Fingers is prowling The Pyres or Grey District, unable to contain himself. He returns 1d6 hours after the PCs arrive.</p>

Paralysis (Ex) Those hit by Fingers’ bite or claw attack must succeed on a DC 13 Fortitude save or be paralyzed for 1d4+1 rounds. The save DC is Charisma-based. </p>

<p>Stench (Ex) The stink of death and corruption surround ghasts is overwhelming. Living creatures within 10 feet must succeed on a DC 13 Fortitude save or be sickened for 1d6+4 minutes. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected by the same ghast’s stench for 24 hours. A delay poison or neutralize poison spell removes the effect from a sickened creature. Creatures with immunity to poison are unaffected, and creatures resistant to poison receive their normal bonus on their saving throws. The save DC is Charisma-based. </p>

<p>Additional Feat  - This feat is not presented in the Player’s Handbook or Monster Manual. </p>

<p>Lifesense (from Libris Mortis): You can see the life force of living creatures as if it were normal illumination. To your eyes, a Medium or smaller creature provides bright illumination in a 60-foot radius. This life-light behaves like regular light—you can’t see into solid objects, or past solid walls. The radius for each additional size category is double that of the next smallest category, up to a maximum of 960 feet for a Colossal creature. </div><br />
TREASURE: The ghoul’s faction-symbol is made of solid silver worth 20gp, although it’s so covered with tarnish and grime, its hard to spot. He also has a heavy ring of keys that open various mausoleum doors in and about the Mortuary. Larcenous types in the Grey District will pay 50gp for them. </p>

<p>CALCULATE TREASURE FOR FINGERS’ EL</p>

<p>Fingers’ other meagre possessions are mementoes of his previous victims and the tools of the Dustman he killed. Among the latter is a well-thumbed book entitled False Life, True Death containing an introduction to the Dustman philosophy. </p>

<p>Note: Fingers the Ghoul regularly burns this incense before traveling the Ward, and willingly fails his Fortitude save when doing so. This habit gives him a notably powerful smell of incense, but usually renders his stench ability tolerable, if still unpleasant, to those around him. With these penalties, the save DCs against his ghoul fever and stench abilities drop to DC 9 Fortitude saves.<br />

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div><span style="font-weight:bold">New Item: Three-Suns-Prayer incense </span></p>

<p>Infused with the purity of a mountain-dwelling ascetic order, Three-Suns-Prayer incense is magically endowed with the power to diffuse foul substances. </p>

<p>Lore: Three-Suns-Prayer incense is based on traditional magics which were made most famous by the secretive Order of Five Heavens, a clan of monks who established a monastery in Shurrock, the wild layer of Bytopia (Knowledge [history] DC 15). The formula has since spread from Shurrock, and the incense is used for its powers against poison and disease (Knowledge [history] DC 20). </p>

<p>Description: A musty-smelling packet of dried leaves and powdered ingredients. When placed in a bowl and burned, it gives off a bitter, woody smell. </p>

<p>Activation: A single packet of Three-Suns-Prayer incense can be lit with an open flame source. Its powers then take effect automatically. A single packet can be used only once, and cannot be re-lit once it has been activated once. </p>

<p>Effect: 1d4 rounds after activation, the incense creates a thin cloud of scent with a 20’ radius. Within the affected area, all creatures gain a +2 enhancement bonus against poison and disease for 1d3 hours. Additionally, a creature with a natural poison or disease attack must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 14) or receive a -4 enhancement penalty to the save DCs for such attacks for 1d3 hours. </p>

<p>Aura/Caster Level: Faint conjuration. CL 3rd. <br />
Construction: Craft Wondrous Items, delay poison, 300 gp, 12 XP, 1 day. <br />
Weight: --. <br />
Price: 600 gp. </div></p>

         <p>Hmm. I have problems getting the picture up. So, just the changes:<br />
I replaced the 5 on the far left side of shuffle street with a 2. <br />
The 24 a bit to the right, below shuffle street is now 33 and next to that I replaced the 15 with a 25.<br />
I just made a 35 out of one of the buildings to the far right side.<br />
I replaced the 24 below wailer's square with a 23 and the 24 on the left side of wailer's square with a 31.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Damn, more Gremlins! Maybe this wasn't the great help you were hoping for. Let's take a look:</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;Eldan&#039;</em> wrote:</div>Oook.
Following: 
a) I can't find number 2, number 25, number 28, number 31, number 35 and number 23.
b) There are two number 5s, two number 15s and four number 24s (though there might be several dustmen stores) and two number 22s.</p>

<p>I'll rearrange some of the numbers and put the scan up later.</div></p>

<p>2 - (Gnarlybone's Lair): Your right, its not on the map! Originally it was meant to be off the map, so I suppose an arrow saying "to the pyres/Blighthouse/Gnarlybone's Lair" is in order, but anywhere is fine.</p>

<p>23 - (The Damsel's Decent): The 22 pn Shuffle Street should be a 23</p>

<p>25 - (Peddler's Nook): Yup, your right</p>

<p>28 - (Lanis' house): This is supposed to be on Rattling Alley, when its properly developped. </p>

<p>31 - (Silent Brom): Completely right. He should share the same building as the House of Shrouds - a wedge shaped appartment in the upper corner.</p>

<p>35 - (Plague House): It should be the "other no. 5" on the left of Shuffle Street.</p>

<p>I'll have a proper look at your other changes when I update the map again. Right now I'm just glad you got it in time...</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Oooh, I can post again! <br />
So, I can tell you about the game to day.<br />
The players (Fire Sorcerer, Gnome, CN; Swashbuckler, Human, CG; Swordsage, Human, CG) came to the outer planes together (my Co-DM ran a short adventure for that). They talked to some Dustman in the street and came to the conclusion that dustmen are boring idiots who walk around with zombies following them. Then they entered the whispered word and got hired by Bald Grum. They talked to the people in the bar a bit, then they decided that it would be best to ignore the Proud Pariahs for the moment and to go look after Dykos. On the way they had a random encounter with a huge tentacle which tried to grapple a young man but they managed to hack it off before it could drag him inside the portal. The sorcerer managed to calm Dykos down by talking to him and summoning some illusions of other dwarfs. (I thought this was a nice idea, so I let that work.) <br />
After that they let Granny Marduk tell them their fortune and didn't manage to get rid of Sougad Sodkiller. They decided to go and talk to mother Xero but met the Joculators on they way. After some talking the whole thing escalated and a fight started. They nearly managed to knock one of the Joculators unconcious, even though the Swashbuckler was put to sleep in the first round of the encounter. But then the Swordsages sword was shattered and the sorcerer was caught in a grease spell, both in the same round. In the end the PCs were beaten and the Joculators took their weapons and hung them upside down on a wall, naked and covered in red paint. <br />
They went to the three tubs to get rid of the paint and the smell of incense. On the way there they met the Zombie thiefs, but couldn't do anything, because they were in pretty bad shape and weaponless. <br />
The swordsage and the swashbuckler went to sleep, while the sorcerer decided to talk to Narma the loud and get himself healed. <br />
They are now completely broke, have no weapons and they feel pretty bad for getting beat, but I think the players like the adventure so far.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Great report Eldan (and good news about the art and nice job on the map).</p>

<p>So, Eldan, what stats do you need to continue?  </p>

<p>*Also, I think this brings up a good point on how naked/broke PCs bounce back (perhaps the Joculators don't keep the items, but instead leave them in some comical place -like having to do a scavenger house inside a "Dustmen Brothel" or climb a greased pole set up in the middle of the courtyard.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Also, my players are now pretty motivated to continue the adventure. They hate the Joculators, both ingame and out of game. The Sorcerer wants to burn them, of course, he wants to burn everything. But he wants to burn them slowly. So, I think the danger of them joining the joculators is averted.<br />
The swashbuckler has also a new catchphrase: "Your making things worse". The other players say it all the time, since the character got drunk in the introduction adventure on the prime.  <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/smile.png" title="Smiling" alt="Smiling" class="smiley-content"/> <br />
At the moment, I think that I have got all stats I need. I have fingers, the players will do something about him next time and the joculators. <br />
One remark though: You need to make the Joculators a bit stronger, perhaps. The PCs confronted them one on one and they were only three people but managed to knock one of them out and nearly got the other two, even though the swashbuckler was asleep for the whole fight.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Hmm, well, its good to hear that we didn't make the encounter overpowering (which is what I feared).</p>

<p>However, once they "attack" the HQ for the Joculators, the EL soars, relatively, due to the prescence of the terrain "traps" and other monsters inside.</p>

<p>That said, I do think we should stat up the Joculators -(sure maybe have sample stats for the main group, but have individual stats and info on a couple of the "leaders").</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Hey, would you be interested in another playtester for this? I'm currently running a tabletop planescape game and the party have just arrived at level three. Two of them have also just joined factions. The game runs weekly on wednesdays, next session in two weeks time due to a con.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">1. How familiar are you with Planescape? (both editions, only as a player, introduced by PW, etc)</span><br />
I first encountered Planescape through Torment last March. I became immediately enamoured with the setting and was shown the PW website by a friend. At this point I downloaded and read and re-read the PSCS from PW and pretty much resolved to run a campaign at some point. Even more so when I then went and read Shemmy's storyhour. To complete my knowledge of the setting I downloaded PDF's of some of the more major titles in the PS series and read them through.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">2. What is your experience as a DM? (1st time, old veteran of 1st edition, only with one group before, etc)</span><br />
I've run two campaigns previous to this one and also regularly DM at conventions so I have wide experience with different groups. I am considered to be a competant DM and allow my players alot of fee reign.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">3. What is your experience with online campaigns? (DM'ed 1 before, long-time player only, none, etc)</span><br />
Not hugely extensive. I've played in a couple of games but that's it.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">4. What of your Players? (essentially the answers to questions #1 &amp; 3)</span><br />
There are four regulars in my group with a fifth and sixth occasionally joining in. All were introduced to PS at roughly the same time as me, have all played Torment, and all had a hankering to play when I started my current campaign (Though they didn't know it was going to be in PS until they found themselves dropped outside Automata being welcomed by a Modron.)</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Elven Ranger(Bow)/Xaositect</span> - Probably the most familiar of my players with the setting, he's written three good pieces of fanfiction. He's read the PW stuff and also possesses PDF's of the older books. (You can find his fanfiction at his deviantart page <a href="http://kbkarma.deviantart.com/" class="bb-url">here</a>. I've yet to succeed in persuading him to post them here.)<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Human Paladin</span> - This player has read all of the stuff available of PW but none of the older stuff, nor has he read any of the 3rd ed books (though he has access to them)<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Human Rogue/Cipher</span> - The next most familiar of my players he's also read the stuff available on PW and carries a copy of the mimir.net cant dictionary around with him at all times. He has a poor memory though and doesn't always remember things.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Dwarven Fighter</span> - Has played Torment. That's about it<br />
Players five and six have roughly as much knowledge as the dwarven fighter.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Sounds great to me -another tabletop playtest would be helpful (Rule-of-Three and all).</p>

<p>With characters already ready, it seems like you're about to start.</p>

<p>One thing though:</p>

<p>So, far, we haven't had many playtesters with "planar-raced" PC's.  This is especially important since we have at the outset been concerned with ECL and relative level issues (and the disparity between no-LA's and LA's).  Any chance you might be able to steer any of the players into adopting a PSCS race?</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I can certainly try. The dwarven fighter might be willing when he finds out that he really shouldn't have smashed all those hourglasses last session when he was in that place in the outlands with that big colourless dragon. Or I might be able to persuade player six to play the next few sessions since he plays a Bariur.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>They're all ECL 3 at present. Possibly slightly lower. Mainly focused on combat though they have been considering trying to hire a wizard. They were in Chronepsis' domain to retrieve an item for Chronepsis' proxy in Sigil who thought that it would be easier to hire clueless primes. The dwarf didn't take kindly to being ignored and started smashing to get atention.</p>

<p>They're currently spending most of their time in the Clerk's Ward and the Lower Ward. They arrived on the planes about eight weeks prior to the current time and are about to undertake six weeks of downtime. They still know very little about the factions and have only been introuced to two factions so far - The Xaositects, who they encountered through player 6 who's bariur is a namer in that faction, and the Ciphers, who they encountered through an NPC they met in Automata.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Let's see. Second day today. Not that much PC-embarassing. They were sucessful today. They caught Fingers and Grimjaw, solved the vampire problem (blood and glory), some other random encounters on the streets and talked to the locals some more.<br />
The fire sorcerer gnome actually tried to burn some of the incense Fingers carried whenever he saw a dustman and was very dissapointed if it didn't do anything but smell. <br />
They also had a pretty easy fight against fingers. They prepared some traps for him. One of them hid on a roof (the swordsage, because he has tumble ranks). The other two hid in a doorway. They rented three zombies and let one of them lie in the middle of the road to attract the ghoul. They also prepared some really clever fire traps involving alcohol, alchemists fire (the gnome had that) and shrouds they bought in the dustmen store. They just cornered fingers between a wall of zombies, a wall of burning shrouds and a wall of swords provided by the swashbuckler and the swordsage. Then they grappled him, which wasn't that hard because they were six people, zombies encluded, and chained him up. It was a nice fight and no one got hurt.<br />
I think they felt pretty great today because everything they tried worked out.<br />
On the other hand, I think the whole vampire story was a bit short and easy. There should be more. They just talked to the jinkskirt, then to mother Xero and then to the vampire and finally they got the money.<br />
Also, if I'm not really mistaken, Grimjaw has no stats yet. (Or I just didn't find them) I used the standard Gith in the Monster Manual and added a fighter level.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

One thing though:</p>

<p>So, far, we haven't had many playtesters with "planar-raced" PC's.  This is especially important since we have at the outset been concerned with ECL and relative level issues (and the disparity between no-LA's and LA's).  Any chance you might be able to steer any of the players into adopting a PSCS race?</div></p>

<p>As of right now, your going to get two Gensai from my end, unless something major happens to change my decision. The deadline is Monday, and I know who'd I take if I'd have to pick right now. It's going to be a good mix of people familar with the setting and never havin heard of it before too.</p>

         <p>Okay, so I’ve got six characters lined up to play online, as soon as we get permission I’ll get this game going (finally)! I mostly have players that are new to Planescape, play-by-post and even one new to Dnd, so we can get some feed back from them. I guy playing Zebidiah is a real cutter however, both literally and in terms relating to Planescape, so we can get some from an experienced player as well and I’ve got three characters with LA +1 so we can test that too. The average ECL of the party is also about equivalent to about a standard fourth level party, so I can also test some scaling. </p>

<p>Zebidiah Agni, CG Male Fire Genasi Swordsage 2<br />
Argith Dezriel, CG Male Elan Kineticist 3<br />
Cyclo Base, N Poison Dusk Lizardfolk Binder 2<br />
Aust Wildnblade, N Male Duman Druid 3<br />
Zepher, LN Male Air Genasi Ranger 1/ Fighter 1<br />

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>First session occured today, though not much happened because I'm currently suffereing from a cold.</p>

<p>The PC's (Bladeling Sorcerer, Fire Genasi Evoker, and the Human Rogue) were exploring the Grey District of the Hive when they encountered the Joculators who smaked one of them over the head with the thuribule and then ran away giggling. They then headed up to the rooftops and started pelting them with paint. The PC's ignored them and headed back to their rooms in the Portal Jammer (Passed saves vs. Sleep and Dancing Lights). After a brief OOC discussion ("You wouldn't know a plot brick if it hit you in the head!") they decided to head back to the Grey District and investigate these things a bit. They found the place in something of a shambles with paint over everything and a dazed looking dustman sitting against a wall. After a brief discussion with him left them feeling unerved (Dustman aren't supposed to be that cheerful!) they went to the Whispered Word to see if they could find out any more about these mysterious barmies. They were hired the following day to deal with the Joculators and also a mysterious creature which had been attacking people around Rattling Alley. They wandered round a bit asking irrelevent questions of people before finding out about Dykos. They visited him and discovered about his assaulter. We ended therer</p>

<p>Although for some reason they think Fingers must have been after some sort of ring that Dykos was wearing. My group has an max ranks in jump when it comes to conclusions. Like the non-magical suit of Harmonium fullplate (They don't know it's Harmonium) that they believe will magically teleport the wearer into the Blood War.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I gave them a fair amount the first session they were there. They never remember any of it though. The only thing they ever seem to remember about it is that it's run by some guy named "Clueless". Despite the fact they've only met you there once.
