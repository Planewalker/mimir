<p>Boccob neither seeks nor avoids confrontations, though he does not hesitate to disabuse others of the illogicality and foolishness of fighting him; he desires balance above morality, knowledge above all. As Lord of All Magic and the Archmage of the Deities, Boccob has virtually limitless options in dealing with those foolish enough to challenge him, or assuming he feels threatened or amused by the other party. <br />
Boccob always has <span style="font-style:italic">foresight </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">true seeing</span> cast upon his person and so is never deceived, surprised or flat-footed. He will wrap himself in various magical protections to stymie attempts at harming him. Immediately after, he will increase his armor class (+22) with single uses of his Balance domain power and activate his Divine Shield. He will always be Seeing Magic as the salient divine ability. <br />
He will then initiate combat by calling on his Divine Aura, setting it to daze, and <span style="font-style:italic">calming emotions</span> to force peace upon the battlefield. Against obvious extraplanar foes, he will <span style="font-style:italic">imprison</span>, or <span style="font-style:italic">dismiss</span> or <span style="font-style:italic">banish </span>them back to their own planes. Usually this will end the combat, freeing Boccob to attend to important matters and leaving the dignity of his opponents intact. If violence persists, Boccob will neither give nor ask for quarter. <br />
He will saturate the area with <span style="font-style:italic">antimagic fields</span> and launch <span style="font-style:italic">disjunctions, greater dispel magics</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">reaving dispels</span> at enemy spellcasters, melee specialists and rogues in that order. He will resolve this round by speaking <span style="font-style:italic">words of balance</span>, killing, paralyzing, weakening or nauseating nonneutral creatures and detonating an enhanced and intensified <span style="font-style:italic">sacred fire storm</span> on the party, dealing half divine and sonic damage.<br />
If foes are still standing, Boccob will cast a veritable battery of combat spells, dispelling magic all the while. His incredible intelligence allows Boccob to select the most appropriate attack form for opponents, through use of Spontaneous Wizard Spells, and determine when to convert spells to the appropriate element or energy accordingly. He will follow up his previous spell barrage by unleashing <span style="font-style:italic">fireballs, greater shouts, incendiary clouds, polar rays, meteor swarms, spheres of ultimate destruction</span> with modified elements or energies as appropriate and repeating throughout combat as necessary. <br />
Against foes that seem to be particularly persistent, Boccob will first launch <span style="font-style:italic">arcane fire</span> on his adversaries dealing raw magical energy and is then quick to cast epic spells, preferring those that strip away magical protections and known spells, and the d<span style="font-style:italic">isc of concordant opposition</span>. <br />
For exceedingly heavily protected and tenacious foes, Boccob will unleash salvos of his Divine Blast. <br />
Boccob will never allow fighting to descend into physical fisticuffs, finding it barbaric and superfluous. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Alter Reality (Su):</span> Boccob exerts a considerable measure of control over reality itself, and his very presence can command the very essence of the world around him. <br />
Boccob can use the <span style="font-style:italic">wish</span> spell and duplicate practically any spell effect as long as the effect promotes magic, arcane knowledge, foresight, foreknowledge, balance or neutrality. This ability costs him no XP and requires a standard action to implement. <br />
He may cast any <span style="font-style:italic">cure</span> spell at will as a standard action. Applying metamagic feats to the spells requires him to forego using alter reality for 1 round for each level the feat would normally add to the equivalent spell. <br />
As a swift action, Boccob can assume any size from Fine to Colossal. This ability allows Boccob to assume any proportions from the size of a grain of sand up to as much as 1,600 feet tall. Finally, Boccob may create up to twenty avatars. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Archmage of the Deities (unique salient divine ability):</span> Boccob is without question among the greatest practitioners of arcana in the multiverse. His untold millennia of arcane mastery is virtually unmatched by any save the greatest deities or cosmic entities of magic. This mastery manifests itself in a variety of ways. First, Boccob has mastered all applicable high arcana. In addition, Boccob need never sacrifice or expend spell slots for his arcana as they are intrinsically tied to his very essence.   <br />
<span style="font-style:italic">Arcane Fire (Su):</span> Boccob can channel arcane spell energy into arcane fire, manifesting it as a bolt of raw magical energy. The bolt is a ranged touch attack with long range (700 ft.) that always deals 170 points of damage. <br />
<span style="font-style:italic">Arcane Reach (Su):</span> Boccob can use spells with a range of touch on a target up to 170 feet away. Boccob must still make a ranged touch attack. <br />
<span style="font-style:italic">Mastery of Counterspelling:</span> When Boccob counterspells a spell, it is turned back upon the caster as if it were fully affected by a spell turning spell. This reflection of spell energy affects even area-affecting spells which are typically not subject to spell turning; for example, if an enemy wizard casts a fireball in an area of effect that could affect Boccob, the fireball would be redirected to an area of effect centered on the enemy caster. <br />
<span style="font-style:italic">Mastery of Elements:</span> Boccob can alter an arcane spell when cast so that it utilizes a different element or energy from the one it normally uses. This ability can alter spells with the acid, cold, fire, electricity, sonic, or positive or negative energy descriptors. The spell’s casting time is unaffected and Boccob may apply the appropriate element or energy to the spell as a swift action; for example, Boccob may fully transform an ice storm spell so that it deals positive energy damage before casting a delayed blast fireball that deals electricity damage. All spells modified this way always deal maximum damage.              <br />
<span style="font-style:italic">Mastery of Shaping:</span> Boccob can alter area and effect spells that use one of the following shapes: burst, cone, cylinder, emanation, or spread and may do so as an immediate action.  </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Domain Powers:</span> Boccob casts divination spells at +3 caster level; Boccob uses scrolls, wands, and other devices with spell completion or spell trigger activation as a 77th level wizard; 17/day as a free action, Boccob adds his Wisdom modifier (+22) to his Armor Class for 60 rounds; Boccob gains a +2 bonus on Concentration and Spellcraft checks  </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Epic Spells:</span> 10 per day. Epic spells known: <span style="font-style:italic">animus blast, animus blizzard, disc of concordant opposition, contingent resurrection, crown of vermin, demise unseen, dire winter, dreamscape, eclipse, eidolon, enslave, epic counterspell, epic mage armor, epic repulsion, epic spell reflection, greater epic mage armor, greater ruin, hellball, kinetic control, let go of me, living lightning, lord of nightmares, mass frog, momento mori, mummy dust, nailed to the sky, peripety, rain of fire, raise island, ruin, safe time, spell worm, soul dominion, soul scry, summon behemoth, superb dispelling, verdigris</span>. Boccob has access to additional epic spells beyond this list; the actual extent of his knowledge of epic magic is unknown. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Lord of All Magic (unique salient divine ability):</span> Boccob is virtually unrivalled in his knowledge and application of spells and effects. Firstly, his mastery and knowledge of spells is such that he automatically casts arcane spells without need for spellbooks – in game terms, he gains a virtual Spell Mastery feat for all schools of magic. Additionally, Boccob may select spells from any spell list, whether arcane or divine (cleric and noncleric spell lists) and cast those spells as wizard spells.  <br />
In addition, his spells are extremely difficult to resist and obliterate spell resistance with ease – he gains Greater Spell Focus and Epic Spell Focus as virtual feats for all schools of magic and all spells cast by him receive a further +17 divine bonus to caster level. <br />
Finally, for the purposes of his Lore ability, he uses the totality of his caster level to determine the bonus (typically +139).</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Spell-Like Abilities:</span> At will –– <span style="font-style:italic">antimagic field, anyspell, augury, banishment, break enchantment, calm motions, clairaudience/clairvoyance, clarity of mind, commune, detect secret doors, detect thoughts, discern location, dismissal, divination, find the path, foresight, greater anyspell, greater dispel magic, greater scrying, imbue with spell ability, legend lore, identify, limited wish, make whole, mage armor, mass sanctuary, mordenkainen’s disjunction, nystul’s magic aura, protection from spells, rary’s mnemonic enhancer, scrying, silence, spell resistance, spell turning, true seeing, weighed in the balance, word of balance</span>. Caster level 77th, caster level 80th for divination spells. Save DCs = 50 + spell level. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Wizard Spells per Day (Levels 0 – 25):</span> Boccob casts spells as a 117th level wizard and as a 120th level caster for divination spells. 4/10/10/10/10/10/9/9/9/9/5/5/5/5/4/4/4/4/3/3/3/3/2/2/2/2. Save DC = 66 + spell level. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Other Divine Powers</span><br />
As a greater deity, Boccob automatically receives the best possible result on any die roll he makes (including checks, saves, and wizard caster level); as a deity of magic, Boccob does not receive the best possible die roll to attack rolls or damage as martial deities may receive. He is immortal. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Automatic Actions:</span> Boccob can use any Intelligence-based skill, any skill that deals with arcane knowledge, or any Knowledge skill, even those he has no ranks in, as an immediate action if the DC for the task is 30 or lower; he can use Knowledge (arcana) or Spellcraft as a swift action if the DC for the task is 47 or less. Boccob can also cast any arcane spell or spell-like ability as a swift action; though he can only cast seven swift action spells per round. He can use <span style="font-style:italic">legend lore</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">analyze dweomer </span>as swift actions at will. Boccob can perform up to twenty swift actions each round. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Create Magic Items:</span> As the deity of magic, Boccob can create any kind of magic item, and need only expend half the time and resources in doing so. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Portfolio Sense:</span> Boccob senses all magic use (spellcasting, item use, spell-like ability use, magic item effect or magic item creation) seventeen weeks before it happens and retains the sensation for seventeen weeks after the event occurs. He has a similar ability to sense the discovery, recording, or sharing of any spell or bit of arcane knowledge. He likewise senses any prophecy or prediction of the future (whether accurate or not) and any event that alters the balance of good, evil, law and chaos in the cosmology. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Senses:</span> Boccob can see, hear, touch, and smell at distance of seventeen miles. As a standard action, he can perceive anything within seventeen miles of his worshippers, holy sites, objects, or any location where one of his titles or name was spoken in the last hour. He can extend his senses to up to twenty locations at once. He can block the sensing power of deities of divine rank 17 or lower at up to two remote locations at once for 17 hours. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">The Staff of the Archmagus:</span> This beautiful oaken staff is shod in adamantine and inscribed with shimmering golden runes that seemingly move across the oak. The staff is capped with platinum sigils and topped with a massive purple diamond bearing the symbol of Boccob. <span style="font-style:italic">The Staff of the Archmagus</span>, otherwise known as <span style="font-style:italic">the Staff of Boccob</span>, is a <span style="font-style:italic">+6 defending quarterstaff</span> save that it deals 1d8 damage and has a x3 critical multiplier. <br />
On a critical hit, one must succeed in a Fortitude save DC 50 or permanently lose spells or spell-like abilities of an amount equal to one-half of one’s hit dice. Only a wish or miracle can restore a level’s worth of spells or spell-like abilities. A deity or cosmic entity using divine or cosmic abilities to heal may automatically restore lost spells or spell-like abilities, so long as they succeed on an opposed rank check. <br />
Arcana lost in this manner are absorbed by the staff as charges and provide 10 charges per HD of spells lost. <br />
Boccob can draw out the arcana within his staff. For every 10 levels worth of spells within the weapon, Boccob receives a +1 divine bonus to his Knowledge, Spellcraft, caster level checks and spell DC. By expending charges in this way, he may negate XP costs or backlash damage when casting spells or epic spells.  <br />
Spells or spell-like abilities that fail to penetrate Boccob’s spell resistance are automatically absorbed by the staff to likewise provide charges. <br />
Boccob may cast any spell he knows through the staff without losing the spell slot for the day and may freely apply metamagic feats to the expended spell. <br />
Boccob may, as a standard action, alter the staff to emanate properties of known magical and epic staves, for example, Boccob may modify the staff so that it otherwise functions as a <span style="font-style:italic">staff of the cosmos</span>, or as a <span style="font-style:italic">staff of passage</span>; the spells cast by the staff in this way use the spell charges stored in the weapon. <br />
Boccob typically has 600 charges stored within his staff, these charges reset daily if expenditure does not take place.</p>       </div>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Combat</span></p>

<p>Though a deity of warriors and martial endeavor, Corellon does not find war as his primary concern. Rather, it is the proliferation of peace and freedom that drives him. It is through honor and mercy that one may find true courage and prowess in even greater degree than in war. It is for this reason that Corellon is primarily a defensive combatant and will usually accept any offers of surrender or reconciliation on part of enemies.<br />
Corellon usually begins combat wrapped in his Divine Aura and <span style="font-style:italic">protective ward</span>. Thereafter, he usually casts spells or uses bardic abilities designed to enfeeble opponents or induce slumber, rather than to cripple or harm. These enemies he then shunts to other planes or returns to their own plane via his magic. This usually ends the combat. <br />
To those who would spit upon diplomacy, who would rend peace, Corellon is a terrifying opponent of virtually unsurpassed skill. <br />
In this event, Corellon will unleash the terrible might of the Coronal of Arvandor and First of the Seldarine. <br />
Corellon’s Supreme Initiative always allows him to act first within a combat round. He usually opens with a Dire Charge, wielding <span style="font-style:italic">Sahandrian</span> with consummate skill, the dizzying array of cuts and slashes too fast for the eye to follow. This full attack usually causes the targeted opponent to evaporate in a mist of blood, evoking terror in any remaining combatants and causing them to flee. This display of supreme swordsmanship also usually ends the combat. <br />
For particularly resistant or tenacious enemies, Corellon will cast spells selected for area of affect and damage dealt, peppering the combat with <span style="font-style:italic">disjunctions </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">greater dispel magics</span> and mixing his arcana with attacks from Sahandrian. Corellon will also usually cast spells to complement or enhance his martial might, a particularly terrifying prospect for would-be enemies; for example <span style="font-style:italic">antimagic field, blade barrier</span> or <span style="font-style:italic">cat’s grace </span>and the like and liberally making use of Arcane Strike.  <br />
If Corellon wishes to engage the opponent at range, he will usually surround himself in his Divine Shield and open combat with his artifact longbow or unleash Divine Blasts at his foes. He will follow this up by surrounding himself in <span style="font-style:italic">greater epic mage armor </span>and casting epic spells. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Bard Spells per Day:</span> Corellon casts spells as an 88th level caster and as an 89th level caster for chaotic and good spells. 4/9/9/9/8/8/8/8/7/7. Save DC = 58 + spell level. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Coronal of Magic (unique salient divine ability):</span> Corellon is the Coronal of Magic; few approach his arcane puissance or his command over elven high magic. <br />
Corellon is naturally attuned to spells and epic spells that are of elven origin. He instantly understands the intricacies of elven magic and is able to channel the power of the spells for himself; this mastery extends even to epic spells, especially mythals, of which he is intimately familiar. This ability functions similarly to the Spell Stowaway epic feat, save the spell in question need not be one that Corellon himself can cast. <br />
Corellon may, as an immediate action, co-opt a protective mythal, harness any powers of existing mythals, whether intact or flayed, or repair corrupt mythals. <br />
Furthermore, Corellon may apply the totality of his hit dice when calculating his arcane spellcasting level. Finally, for the purposes of his bardic lore ability, he utilizes the totality of his hit dice to calculate the bonus (typically +106). </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Coronal of War (unique salient divine ability):</span> Corellon is the embodiment of the graceful elven fighter, harmoniously combining elegance and skill into virtually unsurpassed prowess. This is expressed in several ways. <br />
Firstly, Corellon can apply his Dexterity bonus to attacks he makes with any longsword that he can wield in one hand. Further, all damage made by his weapons apply his Dexterity bonus rather than his Strength bonus. Finally, Corellon receives Greater Weapon Focus and Epic Weapon Focus for all martial weapons as bonus feats. Corellon always draws weapons as free actions.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Domain Powers: </span>Corellon casts chaotic and good spells at +1 caster level; Corellon uses scrolls, wands, and other devices with spell completion or spell trigger activation as an 88th level wizard; 19/day as an immediate action, Corellon can generate a <span style="font-style:italic">protective ward</span> that confers a +69 resistance bonus to his next saving throw for 69 rounds; Corellon gains Point Blank Shot as a bonus a feat; Corellon gains Weapon Focus (composite longbow) and Weapon Focus (longsword) as bonus feats. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Epic Spells:</span> 8 per day. Epic spells known: <span style="font-style:italic">contingent resurrection, demise unseen, dreamscape, eclipse, epic counterspell, epic mage armor, epic repulsion, epic spell reflection, eternal freedom, greater epic mage armor, greater ruin, hellball, kinetic control, let go of me, nailed to the sky, origin of species: elves, peripety, rain of fire, spell worm, summon behemoth, superb dispelling, verdigris</span>. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Spell-Like Abilities:</span> At will –– <span style="font-style:italic">aid, animate objects, antimagic field, antipathy, blade barrier, cat’s grace, chaos hammer, cloak of chaos, commune with nature, dispel evil, dispel law, divine power, find the path, flame strike, greater dispel magic, holy aura, holy smite, holy word, imbue with spell ability, identify, liveoak, magic circle against evil, magic circle against law, magic weapon, magic vestment, mind blank, mordenkainen’s disjunction, nystul’s magic aura, power word blind, power word kill, power word stun, prismatic sphere, protection from energy, protection from evil, protection from law, protection from spells, repulsion, sanctuary, shatter, shield other, snare, spell immunity, spell resistance, spell turning, spiritual weapon, summon monster IX (as chaos or good spell only), sunburst, tree stride, true strike, word of chaos</span>. Caster level 88th, caster level 89th for chaotic and good spells. Save DCs = 58 + spell level. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Wizard Spells per Day (Levels 0 – 18):</span> Corellon casts spells as an 88th level caster and as an 89th level caster for chaotic and good spells. 4/9/9/8/8/8/8/7/7/7/4/3/3/3/3/2/2/2/2. Save DC = 57 + spell level. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Other Divine Powers</span><br />
As a greater deity, Corellon automatically receives the best possible result on any die roll he makes (including attacks rolls, damage, checks and saves). He is immortal.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Automatic Actions:</span> Corellon can use any Intelligence-based skill or any Dexterity-based skill, even those he has no ranks in, as an immediate action if the DC for the task is 30 or lower. Corellon can also cast any arcane spell as swift action; though he can only cast four swift action spells per round. Corellon can perform up to twenty swift actions each round. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Create Magic Items:</span> Corellon can create any item dedicated to martial or arcane pursuits or any item related to woodcraft or stealth. He need only expend half the time and resources in doing so. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Portfolio Sense:</span> Corellon senses anything that affects elven welfare nineteen weeks before it happens and retains the sensation for nineteen weeks after the event occurs. He is similarly aware whenever elves engage in arts or crafts, engage in magic use or make war. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Senses:</span> Corellon can see (using normal vision or low-light vision), hear, touch, and smell at a distance of nineteen miles. As a standard action, he can perceive anything within nineteen miles of his worshippers, holy sites, objects, or any location where one of his titles or name was spoken in the last hour. He can extend his senses to up to twenty locations at once. He can block the sensing power of deities of divine rank 19 or lower at up to two remote locations at once for 19 hours. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sahandrian:</span> This perfectly balanced longsword appears as a simple shaft of blue gray metal with a plain unadorned cross-guard and hilt, a fitting weapon for the unpretentious Creator of the Elves. Forged from the heart of a star, this powerful artifact deals 10d10 points of divine damage per round to anyone with no save – aside from the Seldarine – that dares hold or wield it; this damage is doubled with respect to goblinoids or orcs.  <br />
<span style="font-style:italic">Sahandrian</span> is a <span style="font-style:italic">+6 speed chaotic power holy power longsword</span> save that it deals damage as a huge longsword with an initial critical multipler of 18–20, and strikes with such overwhelming speed that whomsoever wields it may make an additional two attacks within the same full round at the full attack bonus.<br />
<span style="font-style:italic">Sahandrian</span> also strikes with such precision that it deals an additional 2 points of Dexterity damage per hit.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Amaith’hana: </span>This plain but otherwise beautifully crafted longbow always has a pull equal to Corellon’s strength or dexterity bonus. Rumored to be forged from the same metal as S<span style="font-style:italic">ahandrian</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">Amaith’hana</span> is a <span style="font-style:italic">+6 speed holy sonic blast mighty composite longbow</span> whose arrows always deal double damage and ignore armor or natural bonuses to armor class; it may either ignore armor or natural bonuses to AC, it cannot ignore both. <span style="font-style:italic">Amaith’hana</span> always fires arrows from an extradimensional source of infinite supply. <span style="font-style:italic">Amaith’hana</span> launches arrows with such devastating speed that it may launch an additional two arrows within the same full round at the full attack bonus.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Tempus is a deity of contrasts, on the one hand, his chaotic aspect, his representation of conflict and the true nature of war ensures that he favors all armies equally and without bias. His powerful exuberance and strong vitality ensures his veneration by all warriors, regardless of alignment. Yet Tempus has never been known to speak, even his telepathic messages convey a deep, hollow sonorous quality. <br />
Although Tempus is virtually the absolute personification of war, he is profoundly honorable and punishes those who conduct themselves dishonorably, those who show the cowards spine by slinking away quietly in the midst of battle with tails tucked firmly between their legs, or those who abuse the innocent or noncombatants as valor blazes in all regardless of gender, age or race. He also severely punishes those who abuse the deity of peace’s priests, temples or shrines, ultimately aware that war has little meaning without peace to define and highlight it. <br />
Tempus intrinsically understands that war is not a purely destructive or malicious force but one that is necessary, one that is vital for the continuation of the world and the cosmology. As such, Tempus will always fight to the best of his ability and with utmost honor and valor. Although powerful, he is neither stupid nor naïve and will spend at least three rounds observing enemies to pinpoint weaknesses or highlight tactical deficits.<br />
Against reasonably weak enemies, Tempus does not usually bother with his spell-like abilities, finding their use in such a scenario to be dishonorable and discourteous. He wades into battle wrapped in his <span style="font-style:italic">protective ward</span> and Divine Aura set to resolve. <br />
Tempus will begin his offensive by disarming or sundering the weapons of his opponents, and those whose weapons he has sundered and shattered who show exceptional bravery and courage or honor, he will usually allow to go. Foolish are those who refuse this rare kindness. <br />
Against opponents whom he deems antagonists or enemies, Tempus is truly a terrible foe. <br />
Against these opponents, he will warp reality to change his size to at least Huge, benefiting from an increased Strength bonus of +16. He will further enhance this bonus through his Strength domain power, adding an additional +60 to his Strength. Further, he will then become Unstoppable and smite foes. Finally, he will activate his Annihilating Strike salient divine ability. Although he still rarely bothers with his spell-like abilities, as he believes (accurately) that few can withstand his physical power in melee combat. <br />
Against such an infinitely unstoppable attack, opponents usually become a red smear upon the bedrock, their original forms unrecognizable if they are particularly lucky as most are obliterated by his sheer power. <br />
Against persistent or extremely resistant and well warded foes, Tempus launches the same offensive preceded by a Dire Charge. More often than not, this offensive usually ends the combat rather quickly, freeing Tempus to attend to more important matters. <br />
If opponents, through a twist of fate remain standing, Tempus fires salvos of his Divine Blast.<br />
Tempus is not purely an offensive combatant. As the embodiment of war, Tempus, while valorous and courageous, enjoys war for the sake of war. He also fights defensively, especially where deities or cosmic entities of similar rank or footing are concerned. Tempus makes extensive use of his combat feats within melee, shifting through options presented by Improved Combat Expertise and Power Attack. He then becomes Unmovable and makes extensive use of the Improved Trip feat, and when surrounded by more than three opponents will usually become Large to deliver Awesome Blows upon them.<br />
For foes that are neither falling to his Awesome Blow or conventional melee attacks, Tempus will usually surround himself in a <span style="font-style:italic">blade barrier</span>, cast <span style="font-style:italic">divine power</span>, and deliver Annihilating Strikes. He will then wrap himself in his Divine Shield, and Mass Divine Blast. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Alter Reality (Su)</span>: Tempus exerts a considerable measure of control over reality itself, and his very presence can command the very essence of the world around him. <br />
Tempus can use the <span style="font-style:italic">wish</span> spell and duplicate practically any spell effect as long as the effect promotes battle, conflict, valor or war. This ability costs him no XP and requires a standard action to implement. <br />
He may cast any <span style="font-style:italic">cure</span> spell at will as a standard action. Applying metamagic feats to the spells requires him to forego using alter reality for 1 round for each level the feat would normally add to the equivalent spell. <br />
As a swift action, Tempus can assume any size from Fine to Colossal. This ability allows Tempus to assume any proportions from the size of a grain of sand up to as much as 1,600 feet tall. Finally, Tempus may create up to twenty avatars. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Domain Powers:</span> Tempus radiates an aura of courage that grants all allies within 170 feet (including himself) a +17 morale bonus on saving throws against fear effects. This ability functions only while Tempus is conscious; Tempus may smite as the supernatural ability 17/day, Tempus benefits from a +17 bonus to attacks and increases his damage output by 60 points; 17/day as an immediate action, Tempus can generate a <span style="font-style:italic">protective ward</span> that confers a +60 resistance bonus to his next saving throw for 60 rounds; 17/day as a free action, Tempus can perform a feat of strength that adds a +60 enhancement bonus to his Strength for 60 rounds; Tempus gains Weapon Focus (all) as bonus feats </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Impervious (unique salient divine ability):</span> An intangible and unyielding aura wraps around Tempus of such potency that most weapons cannot harm him at all. Indeed, many have wondered how Tempus’ armor came to be pitted and scarred or how his bare arms came to be crisscrossed with bleeding wounds, as few have managed to strike even a glancing blow against him.  <br />
Tempus benefits from an enhanced damage reduction variable of 25, resulting in a modified damage reduction of 70/epic and mithral.<br />
Even against weapons capable of penetrating his increased damage reduction, Tempus retains considerable defensive measures. For weapons that manage to overcome this salient divine ability, Tempus still benefits from a damage reduction of 29/–.    </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Lord of Battle (unique salient divine ability):</span> Tempus is the absolute master of all forms of combat. His innate familiarity with every and all weapons is to a degree of such potent exclusivity that he receives the Epic Weapon Focus, Greater Weapon Focus and Weapon Focus feats for all weapon groups and weapon types as virtual feats. <br />
Any in combat with Tempus who manage to wound the god suffer the effects of his smoking, burning blood. When wounded by a piercing or slashing attack, Tempus’ blood sprays outward in a 17 foot radius, dealing 10d6 points of damage; half of which is acid damage and half resulting directly from divine power and therefore unable to be resisted, there is no saving throw to avoid the effect. Any who manage to ingest even a drop of the blood benefits from a +4 Strength bonus for 2d10 rounds. <br />
Tempus has 98 chromosomes and they're all poisonous.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">The Foehammer (unique salient divine ability):</span> Tempus represents the unforgiving and indiscriminative nature of war. War oppresses and aids all equally, such that an exceptional mortal warrior may be slain in conflict or a lowly peasant becoming a great leader among his or her companions. Tempus is the Foehammer, the great leveler of rank and station. War does not care whether the soldier is a peasant or a member of royalty and so Tempus does not discriminate. All weapons wielded by Tempus function with the <span style="font-style:italic">bane</span> special weapon enchantment. Unlike conventional <span style="font-style:italic">bane</span> enhancements, this property works against all beings and has been factored into the mechanics above.    </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Unconquerable (unique salient divine ability):</span> Tempus stands as a bastion of the invincibility and inviolability of war and is untouchable in his perfection. He is the unstoppable force and he is the immovable object. Tempus’ damage reduction has been further modified such that weapons shatter when striking him or fail to harm him at all. <br />
His damage reduction changes to 70/– and any weapon that successfully overcomes his armor class must also make a Fort save DC 57 or be shattered into pieces; artifacts and the personal weapons of cosmic entities and deities are immune to the shattering effect. In effect, no weapon can ever overcome Tempus’ damage reduction whatsoever. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Spell-Like Abilities:</span> At will –– <span style="font-style:italic">aid, antimagic field, blade barrier, bull’s strength, clenched fist, cloak of bravery, crushing hand, disintegrate, earthquake, enlarge person, divine power, flame strike, greater cloak of bravery, grasping hand, greater heroism, harm, heroes’ feast, heroism, implosion, inflict critical wounds, inflict light wounds, lion’s roar, magic vestment, magic weapon, mass inflict light wounds, mind blank, power word blind, power word kill, power word stun, protection from energy, prismatic sphere, remove fear, repulsion, righteous might, sanctuary, shatter, shield other, spell immunity, spell resistance, spiritual weapon, stoneskin, valiant fury</span>. Caster level 80th. Save DCs = 50 + spell level. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Other Divine Powers</span><br />
As a greater deity, Tempus automatically receives the best possible result on any die roll he makes (including attack rolls, damage, checks and saves). He is immortal. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Automatic Actions:</span> Tempus can use any Strength-based skill, any Constitution-based skill, any skill that deals with war, valor or the conflict of battle, even those he has no ranks in, as an immediate action if the DC for the task is 30 or lower; he can use Craft (armorsmithing), Craft (weaponsmithing), or Intimidate as a swift action if the DC for the task is DC 47 or less. Tempus can perform up to twenty swift actions each round. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Create Magic Items:</span> Tempus can create any kind of magic item that deals damage or provides protection, incites conflict in pursuit of war, or promotes battles. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Portfolio Sense:</span> Tempus senses any battle and war seventeen weeks before it happens and retains the sensation for seventeen weeks after the event occurs. He has a similar ability to become aware of any act of violence in pursuit of war and the death of any warrior, whether such passings occur in combat or not. He likewise senses any valor in war or any act of bravery in battle. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Senses:</span> Tempus can see, hear, touch, and smell at a distance of seventeen miles. As a standard action, he can perceive anything within seventeen miles of his worshippers, holy sites, objects, or any location where one of his titles or name was spoken in the last hour. He can extend his senses to up to twenty locations at once. He can block the sensing power of deities of divine rank 17 or lower at up to two remote locations at once for 17 hours. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Battle Prowess:</span> Rumored to be forged from all weapons taken from all battlefields out of adamantine, darkwood, mithral, silver and cold iron, <span style="font-style:italic">Battle Prowess</span> penetrates damage reduction as if it were any of those types of material. <span style="font-style:italic">Battle Prowess</span> is a <span style="font-style:italic">+6</span> weapon with an initial critical multiplier of 18–20/x3 and the ability to morph into any desired weapon as a swift action, although it usually takes the form of a greatsword. <span style="font-style:italic">Battle Prowess</span> always appears blackened and battle worn in Tempus’ hands and strikes as a colossal variant of the chosen weapon, always dealing triple base damage. It is able to be wielded one-handed and still deal 1-1/2 Strength damage. It also possesses the ability to strike spectral and incorporeal beings as if they were solid and possesses the <span style="font-style:italic">speed, returning</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">wounding</span> special abilities. <br />
When not in use, <span style="font-style:italic">Battle Prowess</span> automatically shifts to an invisible, extradimensional storage space and is always quick drawn in combat as a free action. </p>

<p>Tempus also wears <span style="font-style:italic">+6 full plate of moderate fortification</span> that imposes no maximum Dex bonus, no arcane spell failure chance and no armor check penalty.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">
