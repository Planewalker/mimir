</div> <p>Without further ado and little fanfair, I present three PrCs for review.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Cadence Dancer</span><br />
The Cadence of the Planes - or heartbeat of the multiverse - is central to Cipher philosophy.  A rare few known as the cadence dancers devote themselves entirely to it, attuning themselves more closely through an unfettered devotion.  By freeing their mind of hesitation and deliberation, they become one with their actions, relying in instinct and impulse.  They train hard to strengthen both mind and body, and thus remove all barriers to action as the multiverse needs.  After all, a person that is weak of mind or body may know the rhythm of it all, but they will be unable to act upon it.</p>

<p>To some extent the cadence dancers resemble various monastical orders, but they differ in that there is no rigid order or structure behind their learning.  Instead, they follow their own paths, occasionally looking to their fellows for guidance.  There is no formal organization, no temples of Oneness, no rites of initiation.  Rather, ciphers will learn and teach wherever they feel appropriate, though often places will become gathering points, such as the homes and businesses of ciphers, or a particularly serene open area.  A number travel to Elysium, where they can find such places and confer in quiet harmony.</p>

<p>Cadence dancers are skilled at dealing with a variety of challenges and threats, and often seem to know what needs to be done long before they actually perform the action.  Though they seem peaceful to an outsider, they very much adapt to a given situation.  Sometimes they will work to forge peace from war - or vice versa.  They do what they do to preserve the balance between the alignments, making their actions seem mysterious and incomprehensible to outsiders.  Some see them as unpredictable and unreliable, but ultimately other ciphers know to place faith in the Cadence of the Planes, and to let it guide their fellows as it may.<br />

5	+3 	+4	+4	+4	Be the Rhythm, Pulse of the Multiverse +3</p>

<p>Requirements<br />
To qualify to become a cadence dancer, a character must fulfill all the following criteria.</p>

<p>Alignment: Any neutral.<br />
Skills: Concentration 9 ranks, Perform (Dance) 9 ranks.<br />
Feat: Cadence Whispers, Cipher Trance.<br />
Special: Membership in the Transcendent Order.</p>

<p>Class Skills<br />
The cadence dancer’s class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Balance (Dex), Climb (Str), Concentration (Con), Control (Wis), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Jump (Str), Knowledge (the planes) (Int), Listen (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Int), Spot (Wis), Swim (Str), and Tumble (Dex).<br />
Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modifier.</p>

<p>Class Features<br />
All the following are features of the cadence dancer prestige class.</p>

<p>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Cadence dancers gain no proficiency in any weapon or armor.</p>

<p>Pulse of the Multiverse: While in a trance the effects of any music or song based abilities that grant a nonvariable numeric bonus, such as bardic music and some spells, are enhanced by +1.  For example, inspire heroics would grant a cadence dancer a +5 morale bonus to saving throws and a +5 dodge bonus to AC. At 3rd level and 5th level, this enhancement increases by +1.</p>

<p>Cadence Dance: It becomes easier for the cadence dancer to let themselves go and embrace the cadence of the planes.  At 2nd and 4th level, the cadence dancer gains Extra Cipher Trance as a bonus feat.</p>

<p>Hear the Rhythm: At 3rd level, the cadence dancer trusts the cadence of the planes to guide them to where they need to be, gaining Walk the Predefined Path as a bonus feat.  If the cadence dancer already has this feat, they may choose another Transcendent Order feat for which they meet the prerequisites.</p>

<p>Dream the Rhythm (Sp): At 4th level, the cadence dancer's ability to commune with the multiverse heightens, granting further wisdom. They may use planar union (see Chapter 5) as a spell-like ability once per day as a cleric of their character level.</p>

<p>Be the Rhythm (Sp): At 5th level, the cadence dancer is so in synch with the multiversal harmony that they can detect threats to themselves. They may use foresight as a spell-like ability once per day as a cleric of his character level.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Disciple of Razule</span><br />
Some ciphers take the goal of unifying body and mind more literally than most, using psionic abilities to bring the two into unison. To them, the barriers between the mind and body are not only something to be overcome, they're completely artificial. The Disciples of Razule believe that no distinction should be made between the two at all - that the two are separate at all is simply a widely-held fallacy.  Though the founder of this subfaction is long forgotten and many other ciphers see them as having strayed too far from the multiversal beat, they also can't deny that the Disciples of Razule may be addressing an imbalance no one else has even recognized. Because the Disciples accept new students based on dedication and capability instead of faction membership, they’ve also gained friends in other factions, particularly the Mind’s Eye.</p>

<p>Hit die: d6.</p>

<p>Table 3-4: The Disciple of Razule <br />
		Fort	Ref	Will		<br />
Lvl 	BAB	Save 	Save	Save	Special 	Powers Known<br />

5	+3 	+4	+1	+4	Unified Focus	-</p>

<p>Requirements<br />
To qualify to become a Disciple of Razule, a character must fulfill all the following criteria.</p>

<p>Alignment: Any neutral.<br />
Skills: Autohypnosis 8 ranks, Concentration 8 ranks.<br />
Feats: Body Fuel, Mind Over Body, Psionic Body.<br />
Special: Must receive training from a Disciple of Razule.</p>

<p>Class Skills<br />
The Disciple of Razule’s class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Autohypnosis (Wis), Balance (Dex), Climb (Str), Concentration (Con), Control (Wis), Craft (Int), Escape Artist (Dex), Heal (Wis), Jump (Str), Knowledge (psionics) (Int), Profession (Int), Psicraft (Int), and Tumble (Dex).<br />
Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.</p>

<p>Class Features<br />
All the following are features of the Disciple of Razule prestige class.</p>

<p>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Disciples of Razule gain no proficiency in any weapon or armor.</p>

<p>Powers Known: At every level indicated on the table, the character gains additional power points per day and access to new powers as if they had also gained a level in whatever manifesting class they belonged to before they added the prestige class. They do not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained (bonus feats, psicrystal special abilities, and so on). If they had more than one manifesting class before they become a Disciple of Razule, they must decide to which class to add each level for the purposes of determining power points per day, powers known, and manifester level.</p>

<p>Unified Power (Su): The potential of the body becomes one with the aptitude of the mind. While psionically focused, if the Disciple of Razule’s Intelligence is lower than their Strength they receive an enhancement bonus to their Intelligence equal to the difference between the two abilities. If their Strength is lower than their Intelligence they receive an enhancement bonus to their Strength equal to the difference between the two abilities. For instance, if a disciple has Strength 12 and Intelligence 17, they receive a +5 enhancement bonus to Strength. This ability equalizes their permanent ability scores, and does not adjust for ability burn or enhancements from spells and equipment.</p>

<p>Unified Being (Su): At 3rd level, the endurance of the body becomes one with the resolve of the soul. While psionically focused, if the Disciple of Razule’s Charisma is lower than their Constitution they receive an enhancement bonus to their Charisma equal to the difference between the two abilities. If their Constitution is lower than their Charisma they receive an enhancement bonus to their Constitution equal to the difference between the two abilities. For instance, if a disciple has Constitution 15 and Charisma 12, they receive a +3 enhancement bonus to Charisma. This ability equalizes their permanent attribute scores, and does not adjust for attribute burn or enhancements from spells and equipment.</p>

<p>Unified Focus (Su): At 5th level, the instincts of the body become one with the intuition of the mind. While psionically focused, if the Disciple of Razule’s Dexterity is lower than their Wisdom they receive an enhancement bonus to their Dexterity equal to the difference between the two abilities. If their Wisdom is lower than their Dexterity they receive an enhancement bonus to their Wisdom equal to the difference between the two abilities. For instance, if a disciple has Dexterity 18 and Wisdom 14, they receive a +4 enhancement bonus to Wisdom. This ability equalizes their permanent attribute scores, and does not adjust for attribute burn or enhancements from spells and equipment.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Trance Caster</span><br />
Trance magic is a relatively recent innovation by cipher standards. Though originally developed several centuries ago, it was only recently that it finally came into its own, spreading across the Great Ring. No one member is credited with its teachings, but rather, it is believed to be the final product of many small discoveries, uniting magic with the Cadence of the Planes in order to cast magic in an natural, swift fashion. The general idea is "magic as thought", and the ease and speed with which trance casters work their magic is surprising and disturbing, especially to "learned" spellcasters.</p>

<p>This style of magic appears restricted to those who work magic in a spontaneous fashion, and doesn't function with those that actually need to perform serious memorization or prayer behind their spells. It requires the potential to work magic without structure, casting spells according to whim and impulse. While extremely flexible, trance casting has the drawback of being dependent on the cipher trance state, which requires a fair amount of dedication to the Transcendent Order philosophy to achieve and maintain.</p>

<p>Table 3-4: The Trance Caster <br />
		Fort	Ref	Will		<br />

5	+2 	+1	+4	+4	Impulse Casting	+1 level of existing spellcasting class</p>

<p>Requirements<br />
To qualify to become a trance caster, a character must fulfill all the following criteria.</p>

<p>Alignment: Any neutral.<br />
Skills: Concentration 12 ranks, Spellcraft 12 ranks.<br />
Feats: Eschew Material Components, Improved Initiative, Quicken Metamagic, Trance.<br />
Special: Membership in the Transcendent Order.</p>

<p>Class Skills<br />
The Disciple of Razule’s class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Concentration (Con), Control (Wis), Craft (Int), Listen (Wis), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Profession (Int), Spellcraft (Int), Spot (Wis), and Tumble (Dex).<br />
Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.</p>

<p>Class Features<br />
All the following are features of the trance caster prestige class.</p>

<p>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Trance casters gain no proficiency in any weapon or armor.</p>

<p>Spells per Day: At every level indicated on the table, the character gains new spells per day and spells known as if they had also gained a level in any one spellcasting class to which they belonged before adding the prestige class level. They do not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would normally gain (such as bonus feats, bard abilities, familiar special abilities, and so on). If they had more than one spellcasting class before they become a trance caster, they must decide to which class to add each level for the purposes of determining spells per day and spells known.</p>

<p>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Trance casters gain no proficiency in any weapon or armor.</p>

<p>Trance Casting: Abandoning ritual and formula for the inner power that comes from being in tune with the multiverse, the trance caster no longer needs to use verbal or somatic components for their spontaneous spells so long as they are in a trance.</p>

<p>Rapid Casting: At 2nd level, the trance caster begins to speed the flow of magic through them to match the pulse of their body. While in a trance any spell that would normally require a full round, such as a spell modified by metamagic or a summon monster spell, requires only a standard action.</p>

<p>Instinctive Casting: At 4th level, the trance caster senses the beat to which other spellcasters move as well as her own and can react without thinking to counter their spells. While in a trance they can counterspell an opponent’s spell as an immediate action even if they did not ready an action to do so.</p>

<p>Impulse Casting: At 5th level, the direction of magical energy by the trance caster is instantaneous. While in a trance any spell that would normally require a standard action is instead cast as a swift action. The trance caster cannot force themselves to take longer, there is simply no delay between the will to cast and the actual magical effect. Because only one swift action may be made a round, the trance caster cannot cast multiple spells per round unless casting a spell that would normally take longer than a standard action.</p>       </div>

         <p>The Cadence Dancer seems a bit weak. I'd give it a full base attack bonus, and/or 6 skill points, and probably grant bardic music progression to Bard/Cadence Dancers as well.</p>

<p>The Desciple of Razule's class abillities favor Min-Maxers, which is a concern. Also, it seems like, barring said Min-Maxing abuse, it is quite weak. I recomend putting a cap on the ability bonus gained through the Unified X abillities equal to their class level (so a second level Desciple would get a maximum of +2), and giving them an extra level (or maybe even two) of Manifesting. </p>

<p>Lastly, the Trance Caster seems weak on paper, but its class abillities look like they may have potential for abuse. Instinctive casting, in particular, seems like it has the potential to be <span style="font-style:italic">really</span> annoying. Remember, any sorceror worth his salt knows<span style="font-style:italic"> Dispell Magic</span>), and Dispell Magic can counter most things. I recomend replacing it with another level of caster advancement. the other abilities seem fine, but there may bea few spells that will become broken when the duration is reduced. Lastly, I'm not sure why you're requiring Improved Initiative, but I for one hate it when PrC's require me to take feats not directly connected to the class. A non-human character that would want to qualify for the class as quickly as possible (Level 9) would have to spend all their feats on requirements, and wouldn't have time to take anything they may really want... not even a Cypher feat.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>The Cadence Dancer is really suppose to be more suitable for monks than bards, and its not a fighter class, so bumping up the skill points or the BAB seems inappropriate. I've given it continued monk abilities, which it originally didn't have because I didn't want to make it <span style="font-style:italic">just</span> for monks, and given it more abilities while strengthening its prereqs to the Cipher Trance chain. I'm considering giving it Extra Cipher Trace as bonus feats, but I'm really not sure its underpowered as is.</p>

<p>As for the Disciple of Razule, the fact that it only takes into account permanent attributes, and ignores the bonuses from spells or magical equipment, I think the potential for min-maxing is limited. In most games players roll for abilities and don't get to shift them up and down to create large gaps between stats. Along with the slow manifester leveling and the DM completely controlling access to the PrC, I feel that its admittedly powerful abilities are kept in check. Hence, I'm leery about adding more manifesting levels, as this PrC is suppose to be a serious devotion all its own.</p>

<p>I've removed Quicken Metamagic from the Trance Caster, but Improved Initiative is tied to the Transcendent Order's creed of acting instantly and without hesitation. Their feats should've had Improved Initiative as prereqs instead of Combat Reflexes. But you're right, Instinctive Casting is more trouble than its worth, so I just replaced it with Extended Cipher Trance as a bonus feat. But with two good saves and the ability to cast all spells faster, I don't see this as weak. On the otherhand, I wouldn't be opposed to adding an extra class ability that fit into the concept at 3rd or 4th level.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Cadence Dancer</span><br />
Hit die: d8.</p>

<p>Table 3-4: The Cadence Dancer<br />
		Fort	Ref	Will	<br />
Lvl 	BAB	Save 	Save	Save	Special<br />
1 	+0 	+2 	+2 	+2 	Monk abilities, pulse of the multiverse +1<br />
2 	+1 	+3 	+3 	+3 	Serene Movement<br />
3 	+2 	+3 	+3 	+3 	Follow the rhythm, pulse of the multiverse +2<br />
4 	+3 	+4 	+4 	+4 	Dream the rhythm<br />
5	+3 	+4	+4	+4	Be the rhythm, pulse of the multiverse +3</p>

<p>Requirements<br />
To qualify to become a cadence dancer, a character must fulfill all the following criteria.</p>

<p>Alignment: Any neutral.<br />
Skills: Concentration 9 ranks, Perform (Dance) 5 ranks.<br />
Feats: Cadence Whispers, Cipher Trance, Improved Cipher Trance, Improved Initiative.<br />
Special: Membership in the Transcendent Order.</p>

<p>Class Skills<br />
The cadence dancer’s class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Balance (Dex), Climb (Str), Concentration (Con), Control (Wis), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Jump (Str), Knowledge (the planes) (Int), Listen (Wis), Perform (Cha), Profession (Int), Sense Motive (Wis), Spot (Wis), Swim (Str), and Tumble (Dex).<br />
Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modifier.</p>

<p>Class Features<br />
All the following are features of the cadence dancer prestige class.</p>

<p>Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Cadence dancers gain no proficiency in any weapon or armor.</p>

<p>Monk Abilities: A cadence dancer’s class levels stack with their monk levels for determining their unarmed damage, AC bonus, and unarmored speed bonus.</p>

<p>Pulse of the Multiverse: It is widely understood that music touches on things greater than ourselves, and to the cadence dancer a harmonic beat is a direct conduit to the very Cadence of the Planes. Whenever listening to music that lasts for more than a round the cadence dancer can attune themselves to the melody and move reflexively with it, gaining a +1 bonus to initiative until the piece ends. Furthermore, while in a trance the effects of any music or song based abilities that grant a nonvariable numeric bonus, such as bardic music and some spells, are enhanced by +1. For example, inspire heroics would grant a cadence dancer a +5 morale bonus to saving throws and a +5 dodge bonus to AC. At 3rd level and 5th level, this enhancement and the initiative bonus increases by +1.</p>

<p>Serene Movement (Ex): At 2nd level, the cadence dancer shows grace and control even in the most chaotic situations. While in a trance they can take 10 on any skill that would normally allow it even if stressed or distracted.</p>

<p>Follow the Rhythm (Su): At 3rd level, the cadence dancer develops an uncanny knack to reach their destinations despite all obstacles, relying on the multiverse to guide their every step. Once a week they may roll a d20 against the difficulty chosen for Cadence Whispers. If they succeed, they gain the supernatural ability to sense the shortest route to an individual or destination. This intuition lasts for one hour, and is otherwise as the spell find the path. However, the cadence dancer automatically incurs a geas debt as described in Cadence Whispers. Such quests may be more or less difficult than the original journey would have been without the use of find the path. This ability cannot be used until all such quests are fulfilled.</p>

<p>Dream the Rhythm (Su): At 4th level, the cadence dancer's connection to the multiverse strengthens such that answers may be drawn directly from the Cadence of the Planes. Once per week they may delve for insight as the spell planar union (see Chapter 5), except only the basic forms of questions may be asked. There is no experience cost, but the cadence dancer automatically incurs a geas debt as described in Cadence Whispers. This ability cannot be used until all such quests are fulfilled.</p>

<p>Be the Rhythm (Su): At 5th level, the cadence dancer is so in synch with the multiversal harmony that they can place themselves in a state of perfect readiness and never be caught off guard. By expending a trance use for the day they gain the benefits of the spell foresight except it applies only to the cadence dancer and it lasts one hour.</p>

<p>Multiclass Note: A monk who becomes a cadence dancer may continue advancing as a monk.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Regarding the Cadence Dancer, the standard Monk class is already quite weak (that's why they added Swordsage in <span style="font-style:italic">Tome of Battle</span>), and the Cadence Dancer has many of the same drawbacks. For example, it's not really clear what the Cadence Dancer is supposed to actually do. Monk is the least useful class in the Player's Handbook, because it is a class that is geared entirely for melee combat, and yet can't survive more than a couple rounds on the front lines. Not to mention the fact that a first level Barbarian with a greatsword can do more damage than a tenth (some say twentieth) level Monk. Right now, the Cadence Dancer has all the same drawbacks, and isn't really offering anything much in return. All Cadence Dancer is offering is a couple spell-like abillities, some occasional numeric bonuses, and a few intangibles. I'm not sure that's good enough.</p>

<p>Remember, in order to be a balanced class in its own right, Cadence Dancer needs to be <span style="font-style:italic">better</span> than Monk because the Monk class is profoundly underpowered. If you want Cadence Dancer to be a decent class in its own right, it needs to either be able to survive and flourish in melee or fill another role. That's why I recomended the full BaB and increased skills, although a D10 hit die would be good too.  Also, I couldn't help noticing that if this class offered more skills and gave Bardic Music advancement, it would be perfect for Bards, Bard/Fighters, and Bard/Monks.</p>

<p>Regarding the Deciple of Razule, you <span style="font-style:italic">need</span> some type of cap not only because it would be incredibly abusable with Point Buy (which, remember, is the method preffered by the RPGA and other "official" events), but also because it would be just as abusable (but in a different way) with 4d6 rolling. Say you roll 7,9,11,13,15,17. What do you do? You mix and match put the 17 into Int and the 7 into Str. The 15 into Con and the 9 into Cha and the 13 into Dex an the 11 into Wis. At level 4 you put the ability bonus into Int at level 6 you become a Deciple of Razule, suddenly you have an extra 11 strength any time you have Psionic focus. Thanks to Mind Over Body, you can then Ability burn yourself back down to seven (taking no actual loss) and give yourself an extra eleven power points, that is, if you'd rather do something more complicated than grab a Greatsword and charge in. Also, you seem to be forgetting that it really isn't that hard to get permanent abillity bonues. Aside from the one you get every four levels, <span style="font-style:italic">Wish</span> will nab you as much as +5, the various abillity boosting books will do the same, as will many other rare items and artifacts. Please, for the sake of DMs everywhere, but on a bonus cap. </p>

<p>Of course, in addition to providing much needed sanity to the abilities, applying the cap will profoundly weaken the class, which is why I recomended more levels of Manifester advancement. You could also, give them some other cool abillity instead, although I know not what.</p>

<p>Lastly, regarding the Trance Caster, it is still fairly weak, but I'm not sure what to do with it. Honestly, you could give it another level of caster advancement without changing much. One thing though, you shouldn't give them a level of spellcasting at first level, you want this to be a dedicated prestige class, not a one level dip.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>I just wanted to make a quick point that this would not be possible, because the PrC would not up the enhancement bonus after receiving ability burn. It only considers permanent values, so the ability burn would still cause suffering.</p>

<p>I'll consider the rest of your comments, particularly regarding monks. If anyone else has thoughts, please share them.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">
