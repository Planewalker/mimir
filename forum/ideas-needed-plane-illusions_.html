          Ideas Needed - Plane of Illusions        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
        <div class="dice_rolls">
</div> <p>I altered the Great Wheel in two ways: 1) I tied the planes more to ideas/themes than to alignments and 2) I added a number of planes to provide more symmetry</p>

<p>I won’t bore you with all the details (at least not right now); but I want to throw out a few of my concepts to see if any of the more creative amongst you can add anything</p>

<p>The first of my new planes is <br />
**Samsara <br />
[Note that I stripped this down for easier reading]<br />
This is the realm of the rakshasa. The overaching theme is deceptive illusions that lead to evil.<br />
Of course the plane is similar to the terrain and climate of India and Sri Lanka. I also used a lot of the ideas from the Ravenloft module “Web of Illusions” (involving a rakshasa Darklord). <br />
In this realm, what seems to be best is worst and vice versa. Here one can find jungles full of lush, delicious fruit just ready to be plucked. However, an hour later, the eater will find no sustinence from the food and will be violently ill. Conversely, if he eats the grotesque-looking gruel that tastes like refuse, he will find himself sated an hour later.</p>

<p>In this realm, the rakshasa plot their petty rivalries amongst their kingdoms in an effort to gain more power. <br />
The rakshasa are also working to find the ways to release their dark masters. Different rakshasa owe allegiences to different masters (which furthers the internal conflicts amonst their petty kingdoms). This creates a problem, as a rakshasa lord needs power to fight off rivals; but to get power, he has to drain it from his imprisoned master, thus weakening him and keeping him imprisoned longer. Some of the greater rakshasa have realized this paradox and now only give lip service to their masters. <br />
Even among the rakshasa that serve the same master, there are rivalries between those that seek power for themselves and those truly devoted to their masters.<br />
The greatest of the rakshasa lords is Ravana</p>

<p>The petitioners of this plane are just pawns and playthings in the games and rivalries of the rakshasa.</p>

<p>So, what can anyone suggest to add?<br />
-What are the rakshasas goals toward mortals? Whereas I depict demons attempting to destroy all the good things that the gods and man have created, and devils as trying to make all things that the gods and man have created subserviant to their rule; I’m having a little more trouble coming up with a unique attitude of the rakashasa toward mortals.<br />
Do they just use mortals as pawns? Do they gain power if they turn mortals away from meditation and rumination of the divine?</p>

<p>-Are there any other deceiver gods (but not Loki as I placed him elsewhere) or deceiver creatures that would be at home here? [Asian themes prefered but not mandatory]<br />
I was also thinking of including other classic deceivers such as the “fox women” of Japan who take the form of a beautiful woman in order to manipulate love-sick men into performing great evils. [I view this as being slightly different than succubi who I see as tempting men into the sins of lust directly]</p>

<p>-Who are the Dark Masters that the rakshasa serve? Where/how are the imprisoned and by whom? Do the rakshasa have any large goals (e.g. retrieve a specific artifact or kill a specific god of good) that would benefit their masters?</p>

<p>Any ideas are welcome</p>       </div>

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Some additional ideas (most concerning rakshasa more than the plane itself):</p>

<p>-Raksahsa have many cat-like attributes<br />
-Rakshasas love luxury. Once they have secured their position, they must overcome the boredom of the idle rich<br />
-Rakshasas are manipulators. They form an Illuminti-type group. Small in numbers but strong in the power they wield. <br />
-Like the fox women, rakshasas like to manipulate others into commiting evil acts rather than outright pushing them to evil. After things fall apart, a mortal led to sin by a demon will see he was wrong to follow the demon. A mortal led into sin by a rakashasa won’t realize that he was manipulated into committing evil and will hardly ever realize that rakshasa were ever involved.<br />
-Like cats, relationships between rakshasas are only stable if one is definitely a superior of another. If two of similar rank or caste meet, they will be antagonistic towards each other<br />
-Cruelly rigid caste system<br />

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Do you own Fiendish Codex I?  There is a realm called Hollow's Heart, under the Demon Prince Fraz-Urb'luu, which is a realm of illusion overseen by a cadre of rakshasas called the Hollow Rajahs.  This might be a source of ideas for you.  In particular, the lost Staff of Fraz-Urb'luu is a great artifact that would be very useful to the rakshasas.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>What are the rakshasas' goals toward mortals?</div></p>

<p>To embroil them as fully as possibly in physical lusts and desires.  This is existentially their reason for existing, but it serves the practical purpose that people obsessed with material things and sensations are easy to manipulate with illusion magic.  People whose lives were not so much externally evil as gluttonous and selfish in this fashion would end up as petitioners in what you have called Samsara.</p>

<p>(Do petitioners reincarnate from there, or do they ever merge with the plane?  It might be interesting if Samsara's petitioners all eventually reincarnate after whatever illusory death awaits them at the hands of their masters or the terrors of the plane.  Spiritual perfection in union with samsara is practically a contradiction in terms.)</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Can rakshasa have half-human children? (i.e. teiflings of rakshasa blood?) If so, would they be mistaken for shifters or were-tigers?</div></p>

<p>I would certainly suggest that the half-human descendants of rakshasas would be tieflings.  Tieflings can vary widely in their physical attributes, though if you like I would suggest that rakshasa tieflings lean toward fur, fangs, better noses, smoky auras, and inverted hands.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>On this plane, would illusionists find powerful ingredients/components for illusion related spells/magic items?</div></p>

<p>Samsara could easily be a place where pure ingredients for illusion-related spells and items could be found, and in fact no doubt has powerful items available for purchase or theft.  The trick is isolating any real components from the illusions, of course... and no doubt the salesmen here are some of the best liars in the planes.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Given their report with felines, would to be appropriate for an elite unit of the rajah's forces to be mounted on dire tigers?</div></p>

<p>Sure, why not.  Or tiger versions of hellcats (SRD bezekira).</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Rakshasa aren't all cat-like, they do have heads of various beasts including the Mantis, Leeches, Snakes and other things.  What's distinct is their backwards hands.  The higher ranked Rakshasa can have mutliple heads.  This <a href="http://i.newsarama.com/images/18DAYS-page3_02.jpg" class="bb-url">picture</a> is an example of what a Rakshasa could look like.  Dragon #337 article on the Lords of Dust (from Eberron) describes some of the Rakshasa Rajahs who rule the Lords of Dust, and have an example of Rakshasa who has quite different forms with the stats and illustration of Sul Khatesh the Keeper of Secrets.  Outside of Eberron the Rakshasa do have a ruler, he's the God known as Ravana.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Cool photo (although the hands aren't backwards). I had seen the traditional Hindu depiction of rakshasa which are similar to the picture from Dragon; but I hadn't realized that that had been embraced by DnD.</p>

<p>I admit that giving the rakshasa feline personalities was all my doing. But as I said (or at least implied), I'm trying to find a way to make the rakshasa distinctive from other types of fiends: either through their motivations, their modus operandi, or something. <br />
Right now, except for being either feline or multi-headed; I don't have much on them except for their being evil and excelling in illusions.</p>

<p>I don't have any Eberron material. Do they give much flavor for the Lords of Dust or are they just generic "trapped evil gods" (so as to allow DMs the ability to customize them for different campaigns)? Generally, I think that is a fine thing in products but I'd like to hear more concrete ideas (even if I reject them all) </p>

<p>I was hoping to start something like the Wild West in the Outlands discussion. I didn't like all the ideas there; but people definitely came up with cool concepts I wouldn't have been able to think of on my own.<br />
So don't worry if its non-canonical. So long as it isn't too crazy (i.e. turning rakshasas into teenage vampire heartthrobs that sparkle), I'd like to hear ideas people have for how to handle a plane of evil illusionists.<br />
[I'll try to find the Fiendish Codex and the Dragon article too. I don't want to dismiss your attempts to help me out]</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

Uh, why did you name it Samsara?  Samsara is the endless cycle/wheel of death and rebirth that Buddhists seek to escape.  Rakshasas are Hindu demons, though I'm noticing that you're giving them the attributes of more vain Buddhist devas like Mara (Mara is essentially the Buddhist equivalent of Satan)  Granted, I suppose giving them such attributes can't be helped since Devas are, without exception, categorized IIRC as Archons *or was it Angels?*.  (I guess you could have fallen archons mingle with the rakshasas though)</p>

<p>""Rakshasa aren't all cat-like, they do have heads of various beasts including the Mantis, Leeches, Snakes and other things."" <br />
He's probably taking them back to their mythological roots, in which case Rakshasas are described as having tiger-like features.</p>

<p>""I would certainly suggest that the half-human descendants of rakshasas would be tieflings. Tieflings can vary widely in their physical attributes, though if you like I would suggest that rakshasa tieflings lean toward fur, fangs, better noses, smoky auras, and inverted hands.""<br />
Don't forget lawful evil.  Rakshasas lean extremely towards law, as indicated by the fact that Ravanna in the canon is placed in Acheron.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Can anyone suggest a better name for an "Hindu hell"? Naraka? I am resisting this a little as Naraka is a little more of a purgatory/hell dealing out punishments.<br />
I was trying to go with the theme of illusions and deception.<br />
I think, in Hindi tradition, most rakshasa live on earth but in remote locations.<br />
It does confuse things a bit since I bending a lot of long-standing religious traditions (and D&amp;D traditions) to fit my needs.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>You know, I really like that idea.  The leader rakshasas get power from their petitioners, but the only way to join the leadership caste is to get enough of the other major players to acknowledge you as an authoritative proxy or favored servant of a Dark Master.  This might involve offing an old leader, or somehow convincing everyone that a hidden Master is making a play.</p>

<p>So everyone's lying (or self-deluded), but each one thinks they're the only one; even most of the Multiverse believes in the Dark Masters.

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>This is the kind of stuff I was hoping for. Thanks!!!!</p>

<p>This also ties in well with a side aspect of my planar re-design. When I tied the planes more to concepts/philosophical ideas; I found that they tied in EXTREMELY well with the existing factions (and then I added some non-Sigil factions to fill in some gaps I still had)</p>

<p>In my mapping, the Sign of One was tied to my plane of illusions (where thought creates the "reality" around you - on a much easier scale than in most places in the planes).<br />
I don't mean that the Sign of One in Sigil is a bunch of disguised rakshasas (although having a small cadre within that faction would lead to some cool ideas). <br />
Rather, the factions are derivations on the planar ideal; much like the Fated embrace the "take control of your own destiny" aspect of Ysgard; but they don't embrace the heroic ideals.</p>

<p>In a similar vein, I think the self-involved Signers would be a non-evil form of the self-deluded, wheels-within-wheels self-absorption of the rakashasas that you guys described. <br />
The difference being that the Signers are trying to alter reality to see if they can. The rakshasas are trying to manipulate and alter "reality" in a selfish attempt to escape from the spiritual Ponzi scheme they are trapped in.</p>

<p>The Signers are altering reality to create a new Truth (or to reach the hidden existing one).<br />
The rakshasas are creating a new "reality" to weave a web of lies that will allow them to break free of their prison (or at least they think that's what they erroniusly think will occur)<br />
---------------------------------------------------<br />
So since I touched upon this above, (and since I've always had trouble writing adventures involving the Signers); does anyone have any ideas for what a cadre of disguised rakshasa in the upper eschalons of the Signers would be plotting?<br />
How would a group of evil deceivers that excel in illusions use a group that (especially if united) might be able to alter the fabric of reality?<br />
What goal could they bend the Signers towards that the rakshasa would think would benefit themselves?<br />
E.g.<br />
-Try to use the Signers to entice more people into the clutches of the raksahsa Ponzi scheme - such as, claims that the Signers have created a "Garden of Eden" by will power in order to lure people there<br />
-Try to use the Signers to undercut the plottings of a rival rakshasa lord<br />
-Try to free one of the (possibly non-existant) Dark Lords. [And would the belief of the united Signers be enough to create an nascent Dark Lord? Since the rakshasas probably lied about the personality of this being, would it be "Dark"? Perhaps it would be have multiple-personality disorder because the Signers all had slightly different ideas of what he was]</p>

<p>On a plane of illusions, the ability to alter the underlying reality could lead to some major mind-twisting Matrix-esque scenarios</p>

<p>Any other suggestions?</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Yeah, and Naraka/Naraku is also Buddhist.  Sadly, I don't know enough about Hinduism to help, here.</p>

That is correct.  It's prettymuch like most of the Greek monsters.</p>

<p>Red alert!  Red alert!<br />
Perhaps it's just me, but this is starting to sound just a bit too reminiscent of the Yugoloths.  (Except that most Yugoloths aren't so self-deluded and the Dark Masters bit.  Granted, most of the Yugoloth Princes are too obscure for this subject to come up-- the only ones we know of are the Oinoloth, Malkazid the Fallen, and the General of Gehenna, and we can only be certain of the Oinoloth's and Malkazid's existence unless you count that Dragon article about the Plaguebearers.  Also, Malkazid is not a Yugoloth.)</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I guess it depends on how you define your yugoloths. I always found the official explanations of the motivations and agendas yugoloth to be painfully generic and therefore useless to me.<br />
I mean what do we know about the yugoloths except that they seem to be up to SOMETHING and that they lie a lot to cover their tracks.</p>

<p>I made my own definition for the yugoloth goals; so defining raksahsas as described above don’t come close to overlapping for me. Personally, I think that having masters of deception being trapped within their own deceptions to be very poetic. </p>

<p>In simple terms, the difference for me is that the yugoloths lie to keep their goals hidden; but they might murder just as easily if it keeps their goal hidden. It's just one of many tools they use<br />
For the rakshasa (as defined by me), deception is endemic to who they are. And the more lies they can sell, the stronger they become.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

          Rakshasa rajas        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Indrajit</span> was the general of Ravana's armies, and Ravana's eldest son. That was the time of Ravana's greatest power. With Indrajit at the lead, rakshasa legions invaded Swarga itself, the great palace in Limbo where the gods Indra, Vayu, and Agni dwelled, and conquered it, making the gods themselves into their servants. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Megha-nada</span>, son of Ravana. When Ravana went against Indra’s forces in Swarga, his son Megha-nada accompanied him, and fought most valiantly. Indra himself was obliged to interfere, when Megha-nada, availing himself of the magical power of becoming invisible, which he had obtained from Siva, bound Indra and carried him off to Lanka. The gods, headed by Brahma, went thither to obtain the release of Indra, and Brahma gave to Megha-nada the name Indra-jit, conqueror of Indra.’ </p>

<p>With Indra made into a mere vassal, Ravana was able to make the maruts do his will, killing only those false immortals who displeased him or threatened his schemes. With maruts threatening even the elder cobras who ruled the serpent races, Indrajit was able to convince all snakes to submit to him.</p>

<p>Indrajit was finally slain by the hero Lakshmana on the same day that Ravana ended his incarnation at the hands of Lakshmana's brother Rama. These twin losses were grave for the rakshasa race. The gods freed themselves, the maruts ignored the rakshasas' fiendish commands, and the rakshasa holdings shrank to Lanka and a few lesser cubes surrounding it.</p>

<p>Surviving Indrajit is Garudajit, his son with a naga princess. Garudajit has inherited powers over snakes from both his parents. From his realm in Minauros, he rules many rakshasas, nagas, ophidians, and yuan-ti.</p>

<p>Garudajit is a large (18' tall) rakshasa with a serpent's lower body and three heads: two human heads (one with bestial features, the other with the subtle scales of a yuan-ti pureblood), and one serpentine. He owes fealty to Mammon.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Ravana</span> was the king of the rakshasas, having seized this title from his half-brother Kuvera. He could take almost any form, but typically he is remembered as a gargantuan rakshasa with ten heads, twenty arms, coppery eyes and long, sharp teeth.</p>

<p>For a long time it seemed that Ravana was unstoppable: his domains included many cubes in Acheron, the realm of Swarga in Limbo, and sizable holdings in the Material Plane. </p>

<p>Then Rama came, and his monkey army. They killed both Ravana and Indrajit, his son. Ravana’s treacherous brother Vibhishana took over Ravana’s capital Lanka, and the rakshasa dreams of empire were ended.</p>

<p>Still the rakshasas hope that one day their greatest leader will be reborn. Already a number of rakshasa maharajas claim to be Ravana reincarnate, but they all lie. In truth, Ravana has already been reborn: as Sisupala, a somewhat spoiled but ordinary human prince on the Material Plane. Sisupala has no idea of his previous incarnation, and none but the gods know what has become of Ravana's spirit. If the rakshasas were to find out, they could take steps to transfer the prince's soul into a body more appropriate to rule them.</p>

<p>Sisupala, however, does not want to rule the rakshasas. Though the ferocious spirit of Ravana rages within him, he would much rather settle down with Rukmini, his fiancée.  As long as Rukmini lives, he will do everything in his power to avoid the fate the rakshasas desire for him.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Kumbhakara</span> is a brother of Ravana, like him a son of the rakshasi Nikasha and the sage Visravas. Kumbhakara is maharajah of sleep, dreams, and posession. One day every six months, Kumbhakara wakes up, and his powers are weakened. His court exists physically on the same cube as Ak-Yama's, but it extends through a psychic dreamscape within the minds of all who enter.</p>

<p>On Kumbhakara's face of the cube is a field of poppies; in the center of that field is a golden palace. The palace contains Kumbhakara and his sleeping court; all who venture near the cube face sleep as well, such is Kumbhakara's power. </p>

<p>In the dreamscape the palace appears a hundred times bigger, and its boundaries shift and change. There the raja's court is aware and ferocious, and Kumbhakara has ultimate control over the dreaming reality.</p>

<p>Kumbhakara is a fiend of posession and a powerful psion, and all of his servants are as well. Regularly he dispatches minions to the Material Plane in astral form, there to enter the bodies of sleeping mortals and force them to obey his commands. </p>

<p>Kumbhakara twists the dreams of mortals, stealing from them the refuge of sleep and filling their minds with his own thoughts and warriors, creating an army of sleepers not permitted to wake with which the rakshasa lord hopes to conquer the realms of men, recreating the rakshasa empire that died with Ravana.</p>

<p>Kumbhakara's only weakness is that every six months he must spend one day awake, and on that day his whole court wakes as well. All his posessing minions must return to their own bodies and Kumbhakara must begin again, finding new mortal bodies to use as pawns if his pawns are compromised during the day of cursed wakefulness, shifting his pieces into a new configuration, moving toward his goal from new angles. Some periods he moves closer; occasionally he must sacrifice his pawns and move a step back, but he believes he is moving inexorably toward his goal of ultimate conquest.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Kuvera</span> is Ravana's half-brother, once maharajah of all rakshasas, now the self-proclaimed Rajah of Wealth.</p>

<p>Since the creation of the rakshasa race they had ruled themselves from the Waters of Creation in Acheron, wealthy and powerful beyond dreams, unassailable in their fortress-city of Lanka, a city created by the god Tvashtri himself at their commission . It was Visravas, a powerful and cunning Brahmin sage - Visravas son of Pulastya son, it was said, of Brahma himself - who hatched a plan to steal Lanka from the rakshasas, and steal the rakshasas as well from the caste that had ruled them for so many eons.</p>

<p>The mere rumor of Vishnu's coming was enough to disturb the rakshasas; they feared the great Preserver who had been the enemy of their plots and schemes since the dawn of time, and the dawn, noon, and dusk before that. The rakshasa warriors were soon at alert, but more was needed - Visravas needed to provide them with evidence. This he soon did: one day the rakshasas discovered a mace near the city gates, a mace recognizable as Vishnu's. The following day a rakshasi woman found a conch shell within the city itself, sending waves of terror throughout the populace. The day after that, a stylized wheel was discovered, carved to resemble the rays of the sun. The day after that, a lotus, and after that a jewel that shone like the sun itself. At that point the rakshasas evacuated Lanka en masse, and Visravas and his wife Idavida strove into the city unhindered. Visravas installed himself at the throne of the rakshasa maharaja and melded it to the considerable spiritual powers he posessed as a Brahmin sage descended from Brahma himself. When the rakshasas began to creep back, Visravas was unstoppable; the power of Lanka had become his own power, the soul of the rakshasa race and guardianship over the Waters of Creation had become one with his own soul, and the fiends were forced to bow to his will.</p>

<p>Visrava was mainly concerned with introducing the order, rituals, and discipline of the Vedas to the benighted heathens the rakshasas had become. He taught them the proper sacrifices and rites to honor the Vedic gods and divided their society into castes, the better that each rakshasa should know his or her place. He restructured their military and created the ministries which would rule over various aspects of rakshasa life from then on, and he taught them of reincarnation and the quest for transcendence beyond the wheel of karma.</p>

<p>Eventually, after ruling the rakshasas for millennia, Visrava stepped down from his throne, beginning a life of ascetic contemplation to prepare for his next life. His son Kuvera inherited the throne of Lanka.</p>

<p>Kuvera was a very different sort of ruler than his father had been. He had lived in Lanka among the rakshasas his entire life, and the power of the city had warped and changed him, made him both more and less than human. Where Visrava was primarily concerned with order, Kuvera was more interested in the wealth the rakshasas could provide. He sent his legions to the mortal world, where his father had not permitted them to go in centuries, to steal and raid and conquer the nations of humanity. He insisted all the wealth of the multiverse was his by right as lord of the rakshasas; sometimes he rode at the head of his armies in a flying chariot forged by Tvashtri, and beleagered mortals learned to think of Kuvera as the lord of all evil. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, the older rakshasa lords had not given up the hope of reclaiming their power. When Visrava ruled he had seemed incorruptable, but when he stepped down this seemed to them to be an act of weakness, a sign that even the seemingly immortal sage had at last grown old. They met in secret and discussed how they might exploit this.</p>

<p>A princess of their kind, a daughter of one of the ancient noble rakshasa families named Nikasha, was introduced to Visrava. Their meetings, at first, seemed coincidental and casual, and Visrava thought nothing of it. As time went by, Visrava began to see Nikasha more and more, and the exquisite spells and glamour she wrapped around herself began to affect even the puissant sage, who had forgotten the pleasures of a young woman long ago. When thoughts of Nikasha began to make it impossible for him to meditate, Visrava decided he must have her, if only to banish her from his mind. The two met in secret, and although Visrava did not at the time know it, many children were conceived.</p>

<p>This, of course, was the purpose the rakshasas had intended that Nikasha accomplish. It was necessary, they decided, to join the blood of Visrava, which the old sage had bonded irrevocably to Lanka itself, with their own blood, so that they could rule through the resulting half-breed offspring. The children of Visrava and Nikasha - Kumbhakara, Ravana, Vibhishana, Shurpanaka, Bibhishan, and Khara - six children, a whole litter of potential claimants to the throne, were raised by the rakshasas in secret, and when they had grown to adulthood the strongest of them, Ravana, led the rakshasas in a revolt against his half-brother the king, and Kuvera, Visrava, their supporters and confidantes, even the queen mother Idavida were driven from the city. Ravana was left the unquestioned master of the rakshasa race, and his own epic conquests had just begun.</p>

<p>Although Kuvera could not withstand the onslaughts of his half-brother, he was far from powerless without his throne. Blinded by greed and hubris as he was, he was the son of Visrava, clever and determined with divine power running through his veins, and he soon had a new kingdom, Alaka, among the highest mountains of the Gray Waste.</p>

<p>In Alaka, Kuvera attracted exiled rakshasas and other spirits and fiends, using slaves to mine the buried wealth of the Glooms and other planes too. Alaka soon became almost as wealthy as Lanka had been, if not more so. He is now king of the merchant rakshasas, and a lord of the Planar Trade Consortium. Besides the tremendous amount of precious minerals at his disposal, he buys and sells souls, and has many horse-headed oni servants who play sweet music in imitation of the minstrels of Swarga, where Indra rules. Many yugoloths are at his court at all times, particularly arcanaloths seeking to make deals with him on behalf of their tanar’ri and baatezu clients, though he will at times deal with both tanar’ri and baatezu directly. His palace contains that rarest of luxuries in the lower planes, a beautiful garden known as Chaitraratha that manages to remain green and lush in the middle of the Gray Waste. Kuvera is dwarfish in appearance - some associate him with the dwarven god Abbathor, even claiming they are the same entity (which is possible, though dwarves deny it). He is also represented as a pitch-black rakshasa covered in jewelry and sitting cross-legged on his throne or on a white lion. </p>

<p>Kuvera has many wives: Yakshi, Charvi, an asura woman of the danava tribe exiled to the Elemental Plane of Water, and Rambha, who Kuvera sent to seduce and spy on his half-brother Ravana in attempt to copy the trick the rakshasas had used to depose him. He has three sons; his daughter is Minakshi, who used illusions to cover her deformed appearance and eventually went to Acheron to found a kingdom of her own. Kuvera is also said to have five hundred children with the rakshasa lady Hariti, maharani of plague; these children form the ruling caste of Alaka, ranking below his other children and his Prime Minister but above all other citizens. Kuvera’s prime minister is named Manibhadra, a grim old rakshasa sorcerer who made too many enemies among the rakshasas of Lanka to ever go back to them. He has two fearsome rakshasa bodyguards, a male and female who accompany him at all times.</p>

<p>The  new realm is called Alaka; he is king of the merchant rakshasas, and a lord of the Planar Trade Consortium. Wives: Yakshi, Charvi, a danava, and Rambha, who is also Ravana's mistress and who was sent to seduce him. He has three sons and a daughter, Minakshi the fish-eyed, who has three breasts. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Ak-Yama</span> was an ak-chazar rakshasa, a master of undeath. Now he is a maharajah, a prince of his kind, and he has progressed so far from his original caste without reincarnation, something unthinkable by most of his race. Ak-Yama belongs to a heretical sect of rakshasas who believe that advancement from one caste to another is possible within a single lifetime, something that doesn't endear him to his fellows, but what did he care? He was an ak-chazar anyway, a speaker to the dead. Despite their power, they are considered untouchable by other rakshasas anyway - something to use, but not something to associate with. What did he have to lose?</p>

<p>Ak-Yama owes his puissance to his four wives, each of the Great Ghul race. The great ghuls were once of a minor race of geniekind - either the jann or some now-extinct offshoot - before they were all corrupted by the curse of the hungry dead, becoming in their devious, fallen ways personifications of necromancy. It was to these corrupt creatures that the ak-chazar rakshasa descended. In exchange for feeding each of his brides one of his limbs - the two arms and two legs he had at the time - they taught him secrets of necromantic power that even he, an adept of a caste that has specialized in the study of the magic of death since the beginning of time, had not known existed.</p>

<p>Ak-Yama is now festooned with undead grafts, which have more than replaced his missing limbs. He has also grafted on several new heads, including the head of a great ghul, a dark naga, and a shoosuva - a sort of undead hyena - stolen from the Abyssal lord Yeenoghu. Ak-Yama is the master of his new heads, although they have intelligence of their own, and secrets they keep from him.</p>

<p>Ak-Yama must occasionally spar with demons sent by Yeenoghu to harry him, but Yeenoghu's own feud with Baphomet takes precedence in the demon lord's eyes.</p>

<p>Many ak-chazar have come to serve Ak-Yama, reveling in the idea that he was once of their kind, though the ghuls have not chosen another to teach since then and Ak-Yama holds his secrets close. He also has many rakshasa sorcerers, naztharune, and warriors in his armies, though by far the bulk of his troops are undead.</p>

<p>Although his tutilage among the Great Ghuls caused his alignment to shift to Chaos, Ak-Chazar still rules from Acheron, on a cube filled with plague-wasted jungle foliage. The other faces of his cube are ruled by other maharajahs, with whom he has reached a tenuous peace. Still he is strongly considering a move to the negative inner planes, where he hopes he can continue his rise to greater power unfettered by the ambitions of his fellow maharajahs.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Mayadevi</span> was a powerful maharani, a rakshasa princess. Her specialty was illusion, something rakshasas are already experts in by nature. Her glamours, though, were really something to see, or would have been had they ever been obvious enough that those around her even noticed they were there. Mayadevi was too much of a professional for that.</p>

<p>She was born with the name Minakshi, daughter of Kuvera, who had once ruled all of the rakshasas as one people.  Too ambitious to remain in her father's new court in Gehenna, she led an army into Acheron and appeared to destroy utterly a city on a cube of there. This, of course, was an illusion. In reality she took over the cube, still under the appearance of ruins, and made its inhabitants her thralls without their knowledge. Only a secret cabal of rakshasa illusionists is aware of the city's true state; they manipulate the perceptions of the city from behind their sorcerous masks.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Shukracharya</span> is the power behind the throne of the Asura and Rakshasa: in all the myths, he's the wise man they go to for advice about what to do. Because he's a maharishi [read: ascetic superpower that could readily compete with most deities] the devas can't act against him directly--he has mojo that would spell their doom even if they killed him. He therefore survives even as the straightforward tyrants, like Ravana, rise and fall.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Pustalya</span> is a lesser known quantity--myths mentions that he founded the rakshasa race and that he, too, was a powerful sage. I've actually come to view him as a being that has drifted away from Mechanus but wants to prove by object lesson that his ideas are viable. Rakshasa development is like a twisted mirror of Nietschze's master-slave morality: in their mindset, physical, mental, and magical superiority justify their rule and their arbitration of morals.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I'm wondering if you might take the Dark Master idea a little farther.  Rakshasa look to corrupt mortals,  A certain few become completely entralled and totally under the thumb of the corrupter(s).  In turn turn the the rakshasa invests the illusion of power in the mortal.  If it works and the mortal continues to believe the in the deception, more illusionary power is invested.  Perhaps a group of rakshasa will form a syndicate to invest even more power, and the mortal comes to believe the deception even more.  At some point, the mortal is told that to get more power, a certain ritual must be performed.  The ritual is performed.  The new Dark Master is transferred and imprisoned on Samsara.  His profound belief in is own power makes it real; but the ritual has convinced him that he is imprisoned. In "efforts to free the Dark Master," the syndicate taps his power to use as they wish.  Since the power tapped combines, they always look for more mortals.<br />

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Minakshi, Maharani of Light and Illusion</span><br />
 <br />
In Acheron, in a certain group of cubes, there dwelled a race of evil spirit-creatures who had been waging a different kind of war, their battleground the mortal world, their primary foe the race called Man. Called the rakshasas, they were said to have been born from the primal rage of the multiverse against those mortals hubristic enough to think they controlled it, but most now lived disciplined existences under their great rajas.  <br />
 <br />
Pan closer, now, back to that particular island-sized cube, one face seemingly covered in lush jungle foliage and rain forest like the others in its cluster. Masked by centuries of growth are the ruins of a city. Once it must have been a great factory of pain, a place of vile learning and study; now it is shattered rubble and ash. Perhaps the magics of its natives failed, and the city was struck directly by another cube.<br />
 <br />
This is an illusion.<br />
 <br />
In reality the city is as thriving as ever, cleaned daily of all refuse by diligent slaves. The ministries of agony still function; stolen souls still wait in long lines to be devoured.<br />
 <br />
And there are illusions within illusions: few of the city's inhabitants know of how they appear to outsiders. Fewer still know who truly leads them. The rakshasas remember Khara the mighty, brother of Ravana himself, with his twin ass heads and seven tiger heads. Khara's supplicants believe they bow to him and offer him daily tribute. They are wrong.<br />
 <br />
Two-and-a-third centuries ago, a rakshasa princess named Minakshi, daughter of Kuvera who ruled the rakshasas before Ravana, conquered the city and burned it to the cube, leaving only rubble and ash. At least, that's the perception she allows the outside worlds. Within, the coup was bloodless and completely unnoticed. Minakshi, with her inner circle, rules in utter secrecy, for of all rakshasa rajas her mastery of illusions and deception is supreme.<br />
 <br />
Yet she has allowed knowledge to leak out that somewhere, among the battle-plains of Acheron, a rakshasa Court of Light and Illusion exists. The mystery that surrounds it has made it even more feared throughout the planes. The few rakshasa raiders that come out of it are not connected with the Court itself; they themselves have no idea of their link to that fabled city. Neither are they connected with the city most of the planes believe destroyed; illusions mask the name the raiders use so that responsibility goes to one of a dozen others.  <br />
 <br />
The rakshasas of the hidden city know only of the great prosperity their lord has brought them, and the amazing success they have in their wars against the inhabitants of the Material Plane. And this, too, is mostly an illusion. Minakshi conserves her troops, giving them the sensation of victory when normally they fight only phantasms of her creation, in illusory worlds she has prepared. She wants to have as large a force as possible when the time comes.  <br />
 <br />
It is true, of course, that occasionally a rakshasa will be seen to fall. Sometimes this means that Minakshi has seen fit to execute this wretch for having learned too much. Sometimes it means she has decided to let the troublemaker into her inner circle, revealing just enough knowledge to make him useful in controlling others. With the city believing a rakshasa dead, the special operative moves in secret in a thousand different shapes.<br />
 <br />
One city on one cube, of course, is never enough to satisfy Minakshi's ambitions. Ultimately she wants them all; the whole plane must fall to her lies, and then who knows?  <br />
 <br />
This is the dream that Khara himself lives. Far from being killed by Minakshi, she uses him to fulfill her fantasies by proxy, at least within her illusions. Daily the triumphs of Khara grow more extravagant; beyond his sight Minakshi watches the illusion only they share, and imagines that it her puppet is herself.<br />
 <br />
So it is that for the first time the mystery surrounding the Court of Light and Illusion has broken, a tiny bit, and an ambassador is allowed to come to the City of Brass. A treaty with one of the most fabled of the rakshasa courts; surely the Sultan would be interested? The Maharani has such sights to show him...</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

---------------------------------------------------
So since I touched upon this above, (and since I've always had trouble writing adventures involving the Signers); does anyone have any ideas for what a cadre of disguised rakshasa in the upper eschalons of the Signers would be plotting?
How would a group of evil deceivers that excel in illusions use a group that (especially if united) might be able to alter the fabric of reality?
What goal could they bend the Signers towards that the rakshasa would think would benefit themselves?
E.g.
-Try to use the Signers to entice more people into the clutches of the raksahsa Ponzi scheme - such as, claims that the Signers have created a "Garden of Eden" by will power in order to lure people there
-Try to use the Signers to undercut the plottings of a rival rakshasa lord
-Try to free one of the (possibly non-existant) Dark Lords. [And would the belief of the united Signers be enough to create an nascent Dark Lord? Since the rakshasas probably lied about the personality of this being, would it be "Dark"? Perhaps it would be have multiple-personality disorder because the Signers all had slightly different ideas of what he was]</p>

<p>On a plane of illusions, the ability to alter the underlying reality could lead to some major mind-twisting Matrix-esque scenarios</p>

<p>Any other suggestions?</div></p>

<p>I haven't had time to delve into much deeper yet into the other posts in this thread, but two thoughts:</p>

<p>1) Sort of along the lines of my original thoughts, the Rakshasas could try to corrupt the comparatively altruistic Signers by making them more sinister and parasitic in their approaches to imagining a new universe.  Basically, a Rakshasa convinces a Signer into thinking he's mentally superior to all other beings (after all, he imagines the universe into existence, so therefore everybody else are simply imaginary toys).   </p>

<p>Now, what could be easier for a person to imagine a new universe than to unload some of the burden of imagining to some of his own imaginary constructs? Man creates tools to help ease his labor, right?  You get them imagining for you, then you multiply your powers of imagination exponentially. And then you tell them to unload some of their burden onto creatures they imagine, and so on, into infinity. Of course, they're really just recruiting other beings into the pyramid of lies. So there’s basically a literal ponzi scheme of imagination, with each guy above siphoning off mental energy of all the guys below him. And not just any ponzi scheme, one with possibly an infinite freakin’ loop!</p>

<p>Now, eventually the first corrupted Signer becomes so buried in illusion and corruption he actually transforms into one of the Rakshasas.  Since the original Rakshasa passed on his duties to his "protégé", he would presumably be allowed to go free.   However, the original may have just created a rival for himself and just perpetuated the pattern of Samsara.  So poor ol’ Rakshasa’s got to start over again, but this time he’ll do it right!</p>

<p>2) A variant on the first one, but instead of transforming the right hand man Signer into another Rakshasa, the original Rakshasa just keeps siphoning off the energy for the (nonexistent) Dark Master.  The rakshasa channels the imagination of all his dupes and puts it into the web of illusion, using their mental energy to feed the Dark Master.  But all the energy is really just going back into the pyramid of lies itself (there is no Dark Master at the top!), turning the wheel.  </p>

<p>You mentioned the Matrix there, ironically. Well, here it would be kinda similar to where all those people were sitting in those goo tanks having their energy drained by the machine.   Only the machine here would be the world of illusion, a machine that was so powerful it even had the rakshasas enchained.  Paradoxically, the illusion the Rakshasas want to escape becomes more powerful as they enlist more believers into the ponzi scheme of imagination.  So in this hell, everybody’s spinning their wheels, but nobody’s getting anywhere!</p> <div class="dice_rolls">
