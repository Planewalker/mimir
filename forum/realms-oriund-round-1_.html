</div> <p>Dear Clueless,<br />
We've decided to ask for the insights of the greater interwebs in progressing on Dicefreaks' latest setting. Since it's linked to our own alternate Great Wheel cosmology (which is not all too dissimilar from Planescape), you were a natural, delicious, choice for inquiry.</p>

<p>~~~</p>

<p>"After several months of work, the Oriund Project is pleased to announce its next batch of releases. That's right, not just one release -oh no, Santa says you've been far too good for just one release! So instead, we're filling the stockings from tip to top, giving you a full, if brief, tour of the campaign setting.</p>

<p>To this end, we have produced 30 small blurbs for each of Oriund's major regions. Additionally, we have posted a map that includes the names and relative locations of the regions. To avoid blinding you with the awesomeness that is the entirety of Oriund (and because the poll is hosted at Dicefreaks which imposes a cap of ten choices), we will be posting 3 sets of 10 regions.  For each of these rounds, we will conduct a poll, asking you to vote for the region you're most interested in seeing developed and published. Each poll will run about a fortnight. The First Round's blurbs &amp; poll are already up, so check it out, vote, and let us know what you want to see more of in the future!"</p>

<p>~~~~</p>

<p><p>"I think we often forget what fantasy is. We forget that it is the limitless genre that encompasses all others; not truly a genre at all but our very desire to create and innovate, encapsulated in a word. Every tale is fantasy, and so it is bewildering to see the limitations we impose upon ourselves, ascribing one form to that which is by nature multitudinous. Fantasy doesn't need magic. it doesn't need swords or guns or elves or creation stories or jealous gods or an impending doom. Being everything, it is in need of nothing."</p></p></div>

<p><div style="text-align:center"><span style="font-weight:bold"><span style="font-size:48px">Industrial Technocracy of Arcaster</span></span><br />
<img src="http://i212.photobucket.com/albums/cc187/Dialexis/vicoalport.jpg" alt="" class="bb-image" /></div></p>

<p><div style="text-align:justify;">Like a new-born beast of iron, smoke, and steam, the Industrial Technocracy of Arcaster is a hungry realm, full of promise, but fraught with peril.  Forged by intellect and industry, Arcaster began as a colony of Vinceri, but became its own master.  Chasing reports of unclaimed lands and riches, intrepid explorers and entrepreneurs from the City of Masters settled the southern shores of the Floodplains.  Though initial interactions between the newcomers and natives were amiable, relations eventually soured as the settlers encroached on sacred lands and began exploiting the region's natural resources. As tensions turned to outright hostilities, the conflict climaxed when the colonists killed one of Wenua's archfey -an act which enveloped their fledgling settlements and surrounding lands in a field of dead magic.  Cut off from their homeland, these settlers embraced the might of coal-belching machines and cunning, clock-work devices.  Since that time, Arcaster's cities have filled with soot-covered factories, ravenous furnaces, and fume-spewing smokestacks.  Cannon-decked clippers sail the open seas while steamboats run the mighty riverways, their iron-clad hulls heavy with coin-worthy cargo.  Though some maintain the time-tested traditions of swordplay and archery, Arcaster's soldiers are better known -and feared- for their arquebuses, pistols, and muskets.  Garnering even greater fame and infamy, however, are the Technocracy's gear-spinning constructs and automata.  Guarding the secrets of such incredible creations as well as Arcaster's citizenry as a whole, a council of engineers and experts rule the Industrial Technocracy with capable, if coldly-calculating, skill.  Known as the Iron Lords, these technocrats are assisted by a bureaucracy of apprentices and locally-elected burgomasters.  Delegating much of their duties to these groups, the Iron Lords are free to focus on their private inventions and research.  Fueling such experiments as well as the rest of Arcaster's bustling economy, miners, loggers, and excavators scour the countryside for coal, copper, and other precious commodities.  Trying to curb this insatiable appetite for raw materials, Wenua's natives fight against Arcaster's confounding technology with nothing but primitive bows, spears, and slings.  In this battle between savagery and science, the worst conflict centers around the exceedingly rare mineral known as Esperite.  Called Godstone by the natives who consider it sacred, Esperite is highly coveted by the Iron Lords, as the fluorescent substance powers much of the country's greatest inventions and spell-barren infrastructure.  Also interested in this amazing mineral as well as the rest of Arcaster's artifice, more than one Vincerci citizens seeks to reclaim the 'lost colony'.  And as other nations hear of the science-wrought wonders of the Industrial Technocracy of Arcaster, only time will tell whether its innovations will ensure its independence -or spell its doom.</div></p>

<p><div style="text-align:center"><span style="font-size:48px"><span style="font-weight:bold">Empyreal Prelatries of Arelon</span></span><br />
<img src="http://i212.photobucket.com/albums/cc187/Dialexis/Arelon-1.jpg" alt="" class="bb-image" /></div></p>

<p><div style="text-align:justify;">In a world beset by sin, the Empyreal Prelatries of Arelon shine as bastions of virtue.  Founded upon Heaven's precepts, the Empyreal Prelatries are sustained by the devotion of their people and the wisdom of their ruling priests.  Born in the wake of the Drala’s deaths, Arelon grew from a fledgling faith into a mighty theocracy whose power is felt throughout the World of Broken Dreams.  Humble missionaries and proud crusaders win hearts, lands, and wealth, expanding the Prelatries' borders and enriching its altars.  Overseeing such conquests is the nation's holy pontiff, the Papess of Arelon.  Ruling by virtue of revelation and righteousness, the Papess tends to her flock with the selfless love of a watchful matriarch.  Inside Arelon’s alabaster capital, the silver-haired prophetess reigns from the hallowed Throne of Transfiguration.   There, illuminated by the holy light of Mount Sion, the beloved pontiff is assisted by a vast hierarchy of zealous servants.   Beyond the forty-nine vicars who serve as the papess' eyes, ears, and mouth, a conclave of prelates govern Arelon's provinces as both secular and spiritual authorities.  Collectively known as the Synod, the seven prelates skillfully govern Arelon’s laity as well as its subordinate clergy of bishops, deacons, curates, and lesser acolytes.  Working with the lord-prelates, but ultimately reporting to the papess, are the Golden Lions of Empyrea.  Twelve paladins of legendary power and piety, the Golden Lions are the generals of Arelon’s renowned military.  Guided by these holy warriors, the Shinning Legions defend Arelon's templed cities and gilded fields.  Marching to distant lands, they bring battle to any who blaspheme Heaven's name.  Nevertheless, the cost of such crusades is mounting.  Enemies and rivals are beginning to unite against the threat of Heaven's ‘tyranny’.  Merchants from Vinceri seek to stymie Arelon's advance with godless creeds, coveted commodities, and coin-bought mercenaries.  Necromantic plagues spill from Ras-Morthu as its undead lords try to outright destroy the holy realm.  Scelerian diabolists dream of crushing the Prelatries' domes and dominating its penitent citizens.  Meanwhile, Sha’al's overlords attempt to subvert Arelon's defenses, defile its consecrated churches, and corrupt its allies with shadowy promises.  Surrounded by such evils, Heaven cries out to its champions.  Sworn oaths and sacred duty rouse old and young alike from warm, soft beds.  Answering the call, they don gleaming armor, unsheathe polished blades, and ride out with banners snapping smartly behind them.  Angels, both sculpted and living, stand vigil over the land.  Greatest of Arelon's guardians, however, are its fabled saints.  Having already sealed their testimonies with their blood, these risen-martyrs mysteriously appear during Arelon’s times of greatest need, working mighty miracles, bestowing visions, and calling wayward souls to repentance.  Dark may be the night which threatens Oriund, but the Empyreal Prelatries of Arelon shine as a beacon of hope, promising by prayer and steel that salvation is at hand.</div></p>

<p><div style="text-align:center"><span style="font-size:48px"><span style="font-weight:bold">Windswept Steppes of Kurzakhan</span></span><br />
<a href="http://img408.imageshack.us/i/leaderbybitrixstudio.jpg/" class="bb-url"><img src="http://a.imageshack.us/img408/4664/leaderbybitrixstudio.jpg" alt="" class="bb-image" /></a></div></p>

<p><div style="text-align:justify;">Across the Windswept Steppes of Kurzakhan, arid plains stretch beneath an unbroken sky.  Rising from the northern coastlands and rushing down the spire-like mountains to the south, tempestuous winds race across the land.   Violently wavering between bare whispers to roaring gales, Kurzukhan's winds are home to wild-hearted elementals, zephyrs, djinn, and demons.  From ice-wracked winters to sun-parched summers, the Windswept Steppes are a land of harsh extremes.  Drawn to this untamed land, and somehow managing to weather it, are the horse-nomads known as the Kurzakh.  With white-hot fire in their bellies and the wind at their backs, the Kurzakh are masters of both man and beast.  To the horselords, their dominion is as far as their beloved mounts carry them, and their home is the blanket of stars under which they sleep.   Infamous for raiding the settled lands of Roslev and beyond, the Kurzakh are akin to the storms of their homeland: swift, sudden, and sure to leave destruction in their wake. Yet, despite their reputation as heartless bandits driven only by wanton bloodlust and greed, the black-haired nomads are not without culture or civilization.  Among their clans, honor and freedom are prized as surely as their matchless steeds.  Elaborate blood-ties bind the restless, roaming villages of wool and timber tents, as does reverence for the endless sky.  Breathing life into ancient traditions, shamans perform mystic rituals, tea-reading divinations, and sacrifices of milk and sapphire-hued silk at sacred cairns.  Despite these superstitions and shared-belief-system, the Kurzakh are generally a divided, scattered people.  Nevertheless, legends speak of leaders who occasionally succeed in uniting the fractious clans.  While such khans and their massive warbands are rare occurrences, their shadow looms over the western nations as surely as a winter hurricane.  Even the giants of mountainous Gorjna lock their gates during these times, having painfully learned that the horselords' hordes are not to be trifled with.   Yet, like the mighty gales of the Windswept  Steppes of Kurzakhan, the fury of the hordes inevitably gives way to the calm breeze of peace, till once again the horselords' spirits are roused by the call of wealth and war.</div></p>

<p><div style="text-align:center"><span style="font-weight:bold"><span style="font-size:48px">Eternal Icelands of Navuk</span></span><br />
<a href="http://img72.imageshack.us/i/scapeicebergs.jpg/" class="bb-url"><img src="http://a.imageshack.us/img72/6880/scapeicebergs.jpg" alt="" class="bb-image" /></a></div></p>

<p><div style="text-align:justify;">In the Eternal Icelands of Navuk, nature remains pristine, timeless, and ever-dangerous.  Colliding icebergs, ravenous winter winds, and unrelenting blizzards are but a few of the many perils Navuk's inhabitants  must endure.  Imprisoned within the towering peaks of the Icespines, the Great Basin of Navuk is a trackless tundra where permafrost and polar seas are sheathed in grinding ice.  Time creeps at a glacial pace in the Icelands, where the seasons seem perpetually frozen in winter, save for the slightest thawing of spring along the northern borders.  It is a land of midnight suns, where sundogs mark nightless summer skies, and winter's dark horizons are set afire by hypnotic auroras and otherworldly spirits.   Inside this frigid realm forgotten by the rest of the world, rare patches of lichen, moss, and snow-clad sedges feed the caribou, musk ox, hares, and other grazers that claim Navuk as their home.  Such creatures are in turn hunted by the region's polar bears, winter wolves, and remorhaz.  Warring over these resources, as well as the rich wealth of walrus, seal, and whale that swim beneath the ice, white and silver wyrms vie for dominance even as they stave off the incursions of Gorjna's frost giants. Meanwhile, ancient ice linnorms ally with cold-hearted fey, intent on keeping their hoarded secrets and gems.  Treading the deadly line between so many predators and prey, the native humens of Navuk live a nomadic life, following their food in their never-ending struggle against starvation.  Known as the Nanuit, these polar nomads live in loosely-affiliated tribes bound together by mask-wearing shamans and a common belief in animism.  While several of these tribes, such as the Kalaaluit and the Koryak occasionally trade with the natives of Tavastia and Roslev, the Nanuit stay far away from the fierce warriors of Valhan and Kurzakhan.  Yet, even more feared are the denizens of the Quaramuq, the Frozen Wound.  A massive scar in the northwest portion of Navuk, the Frozen Wound is a colossal chasm in the ice.  Riddled with treacherous tunnels and caves, the Quaramuq hisses and moans with malice born by more than the bone-biting wind.  Monsters and madness lurk within its depths, from the cannibals of the Saqqaq tribe to the demented derro who endlessly delve for terrors best left locked in the ice.  Avoiding the insanity and horror of the Frozen Wound, the majority of the land's inhabitants keeps to themselves, all-too aware that the greatest danger in the Eternal Icelandsof Navuk is nature itself.</div></p>

<p><div style="text-align:center"><span style="font-size:48px"><span style="font-weight:bold">Imperial Principalities of Roslev</span></span><br />
<img src="http://i212.photobucket.com/albums/cc187/Dialexis/518_realsize-1.jpg" alt="" class="bb-image" /></div></p>

<p><div style="text-align:justify;">Like diamonds drawn from dark cradles of stone, the Imperial Principalities of Roslev burn with fires both bewitching and bitter-cold.  Confined by the Icespines, the Imperial Principalities awkwardly crowd the lands between Kurzakhan's steppes and Tavastia's sheltered lakes.  To the north, Roslev sinks into the sea, its shores as thin and tattered as winter-worn sails.  There, blizzard-blown brine and rime-touched rivers continually carve away the fraying coastline.  From sea to icy summits, winter cloaks the land, covering both cities and countryside beneath thick blankets of snow. Smothered under this bone-white shroud, autumn's fires awaken as spring seedlings in a world flooded with melting snow and cold, clinging mud. Surviving off summer's fleeting bounty, Roslev's inhabitants stubbornly fend off the ever-present threat of famine and starvation.  Slaves to such merciless seasons, sly-tongued ravens, ill-tempered elk, and iron-brushed bears fill Roslev's boreal forests and frozen badlands.  Likewise inside the trackless taiga and tundra, majestic firebirds, fox-like unicorns, and shape-changing veela hide from malevolent dragons, massive worgs, and other monsters.  Hardened by the harsh elements, hungry predators, and hordes from Gorjna and Kurzakhan, Roslev's humens are a severe and suspicious people.  Yet, to kin, comrades, and strangers who thaw their otherwise-frozen hearts, the natives can be surprisingly warm and selfless to a fault.  Sadly, the majority of Roslev's inhabitants endure lives of luckless hardship, where honest labor, loyalty, and hope are rarely rewarded.  Nevertheless, the local sapiens, dwarves, and kin toil away their lives inside glittering cities of stone, timber, and steel.  Palaces and temples gild the skylines with golden, tear-shaped domes and tented roofs.  Along the coasts, urban tradesmen transform frigid lumber into fleets of fishing, trade, and whale-hunting ships.  Miners brave lightless, lithic realms in search of bloodstones, silver, and other precious minerals.  Luxurious furs provide not only warmth but wealth for the famed trappers and furriers of the Imperial Principalities.  Managing -or manipulating- these activities are Roslev's noble-born bureaucrats, the boyars.  Varying in loyalty, power, and ambition, these aristocrats range from almost-peers to mere puppets of Roslev's princes -princes who in turn war over the coveted title of tsar.  Outside the cities, countless serfs tend to their masters' sprawling manors, scattered settlements, and fields of barley, wheat, and chamomile.  Meanwhile, ghosts and grey-bearded domovoi haunt the rural homesteads, acting as gentle guardians or unseen terrors.  Placating -or sometimes inciting- these spirits, witches and wizened crones lead midnight sabbats and summon beings from the netherworld.  Warlocks and werewolves stalk the countryside, preying upon unsuspecting travelers and villagers alike.  Within Roslev's ubiquitous bogs, lakes, and rivers, green-skinned vodyanoi and water-slick rusalka cheat and charm passersby of their possessions, with the lucky ones only losing their purses.  Beset by such dangers and more, Roslev's citizens increasingly forsake their old faiths, abandoning their time-worn traditions for priests and philosophies both virtuous and vain.  Yet, for all their peril, the Imperial Principalities of Roslev shine like gemstones in the night -their gleam attracting the gaze of both man and monster.</div></p>

<p><div style="text-align:center"><span style="font-size:48px"><span style="font-weight:bold">Infernal Imperium of Scelerus</span></span><br />
<img src="http://i212.photobucket.com/albums/cc187/Dialexis/greekcity-1.jpg" alt="" class="bb-image" /></div></p>

<p><div style="text-align:justify;">Hell's yoke hangs heavy upon the Infernal Imperium of Scelerus. Blood stains its history, damnation its destiny. Since its brutal beginnings, Scelerus has endured countless wars, assassinations, and uprisings. Wrought by such violence, the nation has withstood numerous incarnations, ranging from fledgling city-states to feudal empires. Yet, with each shift in power, Scelerus' servitude to Perdition has only increased. As the shackles of Hell tighten, hearts abandon hope, convinced that enslavement is inescapable -or for those beyond Scelerus' borders, inevitable.  Such fears have only grown in the wake of the most recent revolution. Overthrowing the previous plutocracy, Scelerus' current ruler, Imperator Caderus Thrax, reshaped the country into a military dictatorship worthy of dread, if not devotion. Once a Golden Lion of Arelon, Caderus distinguished himself as an unparalleled general during Haziran's crusades and Ma'arath's war with the Abyss. Tragically, Caderus' fame darkened as the paladin forsook Heaven's embrace for the wanton arms of Hell. While his apostasy stunned many within Arelon and beyond, his deeds as Imperator have shaken all of Oriund -for when Caderus marches to war, victory is as sure as a devil's pact. Armed with the unwavering support of Scelerus' legions, the emperor rules the Imperium without remorse or rival. Appointed by the legendary tyrant, a host of procurators, consuls, and local prefects govern the provinces, collecting tribute and enforcing order. Unsleeping lictors and heartless inquisitors guard Scelerus' basilicas and brimstone-carved palaces. Diabolists offer sacrifices of gold, flesh, and souls while fanatical priests watch their flocks for the faintest sign of heresy or sedition. Overseeing these orders and their zealous clergy is the Infernus Sacrorum, a council of nine pontiffs.  Serving at the emperor's pleasure, each pontifex, or Dark Apostle, is sworn to a distinct Lord of Perdition, a fact that causes considerable contention among their ranks. Manipulating much of this intrigue to her own gain is Pontifex Cassia, the Dark Apostle of Nessus. Adding to the arch-priests’ machinations, deposed plutarchs and disinherited nobles conspire, seeking past thrones and future riches. Beneath them, the common citizens toil, paying lip service to Perdition even as they curse their fates. Nevertheless, Scelerus' countless slaves and crucifix-lined roads remind plebeians and patricians alike that their lots could always worsen. Aqueducts and other architectural masterpieces allow the cajoled citizenry to live in wicked pleasure, if not peace. Massive baths, brothels, and bloody amphitheaters testify to Scelerian prosperity, carnality, and decadence. At the heart of this unholy empire lies Horax, the City of Nine Circles. Built atop an ancient caldera, the Imperium's capitol is cut into nine descending tiers surrounding a lake of fire. While the entire city glows with the magma's hellish light, the lower levels' lead-paved streets and bronze towers smolder and hiss with unbearable heat, creating a climate where only devils and their descendants can safely dwell. From this haven of smoke and scalding steel, Horax' leaders guide the Imperium as it increases Perdition’s ledger of damned souls. For in the Infernal Imperium of Scelerus, Hell rules with an iron fist, its grip ever-tightening on the World of Broken Dreams.</div></p>

<p><div style="text-align:center"><span style="font-size:48px"><span style="font-weight:bold">Grand Duchies of Tavastia</span></span><br />
<a href="http://img827.imageshack.us/i/greeng.jpg/" class="bb-url"><img src="http://a.imageshack.us/img827/6660/greeng.jpg" alt="" class="bb-image" /></a></div></p>

<p><div style="text-align:justify;">Set between the snow-swept Icespines and wave-tossed Sea of White Stallions, the Grand Duchies of Tavastia are ruled by water -and the blood of those who claim it.  Rivers, both frozen and fast-flowing, continually carve the face of this cold, yet captivating land.   Ghosts of ancient glaciers manifest as gigantic gorges, sheer-cut canyons, and ubiquitous lakes.  With winter's passing, the mountains shed their snowy cloaks, flooding Tavastia's thundering falls, low river-valleys, and peat-laden bogs.  Filling these icy waterways, rainbow-hued trout and rapid-leaping salmon nourish cave bears, white-furred worgs, and giant eagles.  Supplementing the diet of such voracious predators -or challenging them for their prey, ghostly lynx, giant owls, and gluttonous wolverines dine on marten, vole, and geese. Sheltering these beasts as well as devious hags, reclusive elves, and winsome fey are boreal forests of incredible beauty and age.  Inside the taiga, lance-like pines, candle spruces, and silvery birch burst from blankets of blueberry shrubs and carpets of chest-high toadstools.  Outside the lumber-rich woodlands, lingonberries, heather, lichens, and crowberries give color and life to Tavastia's southern tundra.  Seeking to master this rugged wilderness and its rich resources, the citizens of the Grand Duchies are a calm, but confident, lot. Industrious, if still savoring a good sauna and well-told tale, the village-dwelling sapiens, dwarves, half-elves, and kin labor as lumberjacks, fishermen, miners, farmers, and reindeer-drovers.  Within the walled cities and their cobbled streets, brightly-colored buildings, and massive castles, a middle-class of craftsmen and merchants skillfully improve the nation's reputation and riches.  Reaping the largest share of such fortunes is the local nobility.  Venerable and fledgling bloodlines rule the various fiefdoms as knights, barons, and counts.  Receiving the fealty and tribute of these lesser lords, the most powerful, established houses govern the Grand Duchies of Savonia, Ostrov, and Varm. Chosen and crowned by the Grand Dukes is the Prince of Tavastia.  While some princes have wielded exceptional authority and power, the monarch's sovereignty is far from absolute -a tradition reinforced by the suspicious deaths of upstart princes.  Managing this delicate balance of power -as well as protecting the citizenry against foreign and monstrous attacks- are the Royal Magistrates of Tavastia.  Also known as the Spelgaard, the Magistrates are an elite order of mages invested with the authority of judge, jury, and as necessary, executioner.  Despite the infamy such power begets, the Spelgaard -and their leader, the High Spelgaard and Royal Mage- are generally fair and just, a fact that does much to explain Tavastia's relative peace and prosperity.  Sadly, wealth often invites war -and over the years, the Grand Duchies have seen much battle and bloodshed.  Beyond curbing Roslev's ambitions and the occasional flight of white dragons, Tavastia greatest threat comes from Gorjna and its host of giants.  Goaded by humen treasure and the loss of their once-great empire, Gorjna's Jarls brood, knowing that Tavastia was once theirs -and could be again, if they united their bickering tribes.  Likewise reminded of these facts by the ancient and more recent ruins that riddle the Grand Duchies of Tavastia, the locals look to the twilight-crowned mountains with a combination of dread and icy resolve, knowing that it is only a matter of when, not if, the next incursion comes.</div></p>

<p><div style="text-align:center"><span style="font-size:48px"><span style="font-weight:bold">Wild Runelands of Valhan</span></span><br />
<img src="http://i212.photobucket.com/albums/cc187/Dialexis/valhan-1.jpg" alt="" class="bb-image" /></div></p>

<p><div style="text-align:justify;">Fierce hearts roam the Wild Runelands of Valhan.  Reaching from Wenua's fey-touched woods to Navuk's frozen wastelands, the Runelands are vast as they are varied.  On its western edge, where land rushes heedlessly into tumultuous sea, mighty fjords and ship-rending skerries mark Valhan's glacier and gale-hewn shores.  Held by towering mountains to the east and south, icy tundra and rime-blasted taiga give way to rolling fields and falling foothills.  To the north, the landscape melts into mist-wreathed moors, starlit lochs, and trackless bogs.  Across the countryside, spring weeps without restraint, rousing summer and its fields of blushing heather and emerald clover.   With the passing of autumn's golden pyre, winter returns to Valhan with a vengeance, ravaging the land with its icy claws.  Reveling in the unforgiving beauty of such climes, mythical creatures, both fair and foul, claim the country as their own.  Within the Runelands' rocky shoals, shape-shifting selkie hide from sahuagin and man-eating sharks.  Huldra, glaistig, and other fey haunt the thistled woods and verdant glens, beguiling mortals with beauty and sorcery.  Sprites steal from dim-witted ogres while ravenous trolls scout the countryside for cattle, sheep, and unlucky shepherds.  Atop the cloud-swathed summits, wise and benevolent giants war against cruel linnorms and their loveless kin.  Across the wild frontier, ancient monoliths and towering menhirs give testament to the antiquity of these conflicts and the civilizations they have destroyed.  Living among such battling behemoths and their rune-scribed ruins, the humens of Valhan seek to leave their own mark upon the land.  Dwarves, both goodly and grey, delve beneath the soil, searching for gold and gems.  From such precious finds, the stout folk fashion works of timeless glory and undying greed.  Equally inspiring envy and awe, elves defend their moonlit forests, revealing themselves and their secrets of mithril and magic to a fortunate few.  Learning from such races, or outright raiding their treasures, are Valhan's sapiens.  Ruled by kings, the local clans are known for their fearsome tempers and untamed spirits.  Slaking their thirst for battle and blood, the barbaric southerners war amongst themselves, the wilds, and the herd-rich settlements to the north.  Heeding the banshee-like wail of warpipes and horns, armies clash across the Runelands, filling the fens and moorlands with the sound of clashing blades and the bodies of the fallen.  In the wake of such wars, cairns litter the land.  Wights and wergild beckon from dark barrows, while shieldmaidens serve their lords as death-dealing valkyries.  Within the meadhalls of jarls and thanes, skalds sing kennings and epic tales both false and true.  Druids gather in dolmens as norn-touched seers spin prophecy like golden flax.  Overshadowing each of these forces, however, are the Mists of Valhan.  Mysterious as they are magical, the fabled fogbanks drift across the Runelands, appearing and disappearing without reason or warning.  In their wake, settlements are swallowed whole or spit out transformed, heroes return from the grave, and monsters emerge like nightmares given flesh.  Fed by such legends, the Wild Runelands of Valhan beckon the bold, goading some to greatness while driving others to their doom.</div></p>

<p><div style="text-align:center"><span style="font-size:48px"><span style="font-weight:bold">Vinceri, City of Masters</span></span><br />
<img src="http://i212.photobucket.com/albums/cc187/Dialexis/vincericity-1-1.jpg" alt="" class="bb-image" /></div></p>

<p><div style="text-align:justify;">Endless wonders fill Vinceri, City of Masters.  From its cloud-touched towers, Vinceri overlooks the World of Broken Dreams with an all-appraising eye. Grudgingly accounted as Oriund's most powerful nation, the massive city-state considers itself the pinnacle of civilization.  Here, brilliant craftsmen blend spell and science, pushing their arts ever closer to perfection.  Genius and madness goad men like ghostly muses, driving minds to despair and discovery alike.  Alchemists unravel the elements while astronomers cull secrets from the stars.  Steam and sorcery create gear-toothed docks, clockwork carriages, and magnetic lifts. Menageries breed beasts whose bizarre bloodlines shame even chimera.  Exotic gardens and intricate water-wheels adorn piazza and city-spanning portals.  Drawn to such spectacles and splendors, visitors pour into the City of Masters.  Sheikhs from Nar-Qadam haggle with sailors from Roslev over flying carpets, narwhal horns, and phoenix-feathers. Slavers incite bidding wars between Scelerian diabolists and Kheptic architects.  Arnfolk barter for Athican wine, Valhan mead, and Shengu sake.  Even more fantastic are the ghosts promising crowns for flesh, genies granting immortality for eternal servitude, and night hags trading dreams for dying breaths.  While most of these foreigners return home with tale-laden tongues, many remain, ensnared by the kaleidoscope of sights and sounds.  Vying for the hearts and purses of the eclectic mob, guilds and nation-spanning consortia rival kings in wealth, power, and arrogance.  Academies and apprenticeships beckon the brightest minds like moths to flame.  Within stained-glass halls and granite laboratories, these institutions splay life, death. and other mysteries on their tables, exhuming enlightenment from ignorance.  Though all faiths are tolerated in the City of Masters, knowledge, money, and might are Vinceri's only gods.  Similarly, no monarch or noble rules here, nor do bloodlines matter a whit. Instead, only the most capable, creative, and committed rise to the top.  Fortune, however, is fickle, as riches return to rags all-too easily in Vinceri's ever-changing economy.  Nevertheless, ambitious citizens continue climbing the ladder of coins, eager to join the city's elite.  Chief among this vaunted echelon are the Signoria, the city's ruling body.  Elected by the local guildmasters, the Signoria, also known as the Council of Five, protect their nation's prosperity, guided by the invisible hand of Vinceri's true master -Aemmoral the Principle, Oriund's greatest archmage, past and present.  Under such august, if generally unseen, direction, the Signoria defend the city and its markets with a host of mercenaries, constructs, and the largely disenfranchised Chanticleers.  Once the city's elite guardians, the cockerel-plumed Chanticleers currently act as foppish stewards of culture and customs, their old role taken over by the living constructs called Corazza.  Forged with brass, gears, and piping, but imbued with intelligence, if not souls, the Corazza have become citizens of their city in every sense, serving not only as steel-skinned soldiers, but also as resilient workers unconcerned by thirst, hunger, and fatigue.  Carrying these unique natives -as well as the rest of Vinceri's countless commodities- to distant lands, galleys, caravans, and incredible airships traverse land, sea, and sky, bringing ever-increasing fortune and fame to their homeland.  Despite these profits and prestige, poverty abounds in Vinceri's bowels.  Beneath the glittering markets and opulent mansions, massive factories clang and clatter with the labor of the indigent. Slinking off to their shanties below, Vinceri's unskilled and unlucky dwell amid dross, living off the scraps of the rich and powerful.  Underground, furnaces roar with ringing hammers and smelting ore. Giant forges belch smoke, steam, and ash above, while poisonous waste seeps into the Slagpits below.  There, in the forgotten belly of the city, the refuse of an entire nation gathers. Unseen by the world above, outcasts sift through the junk, turning discarded treasures into makeshift shelter, sustenance, and strange devices.  Meanwhile, beasts both magical and mechanical live, hunt, and breed among the titanic trash-heaps.  Turning a blind eye to such dangers, Vinceri, City of Masters, gazes upon the World of Broken Dreams with unabashed greed and pride, confident that its coffers -and wonders- will continue to overflow.</div></p>

<p><div style="text-align:center"><span style="font-size:48px"><span style="font-weight:bold">Verdant Floodplains of Wenua</span></span><br />
<a href="http://img29.imageshack.us/i/wenua2.jpg/" class="bb-url"><img src="http://a.imageshack.us/img29/4084/wenua2.jpg" alt="" class="bb-image" /></a></div></p>

<p><div style="text-align:justify;">Across the Verdant Floodplains of Wenua, nature wars against the insatiable demands of civilization. Once a vast wilderness untouched by selfish hands, Wenua was a fertile paradise whose life-giving bounty was only rivaled by its breath-taking beauty.  During this timeless age, the Verdant Floodplains was home and haven to Ursug, goddess of swamps and sloth.  Uninterested in the petty squabbling of her siblings, Ursug allowed the land to develop as nature desired, content to wallow in the plentiful mires and marshes of the Floodplains.  In the absence of divine domination, Wenua fell under the sway of Oriund's all-but-unseen archfey.  Guiding the endless roll of seasons from their otherworldly realms beyond the World of Broken Dreams, these paragons of nature transformed the region into an unbroken land where the susurrus of ever-shifting tides mingled with the rustling of arboreal giants and seas of swaying rushes. Flora and fauna filled the Verdant Floodplains; the never-ending cycle of predator and prey, life and death, continually monitored by Annwn's unsleeping eye.  Dwelling in harmony with this delicate balance, the first humens of Wenua were primitive hunter-gatherers, subsisting on nature's bounty without overtaxing her generosity.  Spurned as simple-minded savages by the rest of the world, the shamans of these aboriginal tribes of sapiens, elves, and kin were nevertheless wise in the ways of communicating with and placating Wenua's protective, if fickle, fey.  Leaving little to no footprint upon the land, these societies and nature spirits coexisted in peace for uncounted centuries.  However, this verdant reverie was irrevocably shattered with the arrival of settlers from Scelerus and Vinceri.  Inspired by imperial decree and infernal ambitions, the first wave of Scelerians would sweep across the northern grasslands, devastating entire habitats and the helpless creatures that called them home.  Unprepared for this plague of diabolical conquerors, the fey of the northern Floodplains were slaughtered while the local tribes were enslaved and forced to toil beneath the lash of infernal taskmasters.  Scelerus' expansion eventually checked by Wenua's enraged survivors, the borders between the two populaces remain perennially painted in blood. To the south, further turmoil came with the appearance of colonists from Vinceri -turmoil that continues as the resource-hungry citizens of Arcaster encroach on native lands. Defending their home against such incursions and more, the native tribes, treants, and enraged fey of the Floodplains strike back with sorcery, seduction, and swarms of owlbears, griffons, and other fearsome beasts. By such measures and more, the Verdant Floodplains of Wenua remind the world that, while its purity and peace may be lost, its power remains.</div></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Without any prior familiarity with the proposed setting, I vote for Scelerus.  Looking at the graphic, I assume the region is modeled at least a little bit on ancient Rome.  Bonus points if the world creators have studied classical history to any significant extent.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>At long last... the third and final poll: vote here or at its <a href="http://dicefreaks.superforums.org/viewtopic.php?f=65&amp;t=3525" class="bb-url">thread</a> at Dicefreaks. </p>

<p><div style="text-align:center"><span style="font-weight:bold">Realms of Oriund: Round III</span></div></p>

<p><div style="text-align:center"><span style="font-weight:bold">Free Crownlands of Arn</span><br />
<a href="http://img843.imageshack.us/i/arnlands.jpg/" class="bb-url"><img src="http://a.imageshack.us/img843/9884/arnlands.jpg" alt="" class="bb-image" /></a></div></p>

<p><div style="text-align:justify;">In the Free Crownlands of Arn, the dreams of tyrants are both born and broken.  Across river-fed forests and rolling countrysides, petty  kingdoms fight for independence, dominance, and permanence.  Few succeed.  Instead, the Crownlands are a cartographer's nightmare -or paradise, depending on one's view- as Arn is infamous for the transience of its thrones and the ever-changing names and borders of its realms.  Would-be-kings, ambitious warlords, and exiled nobles battle one another with swords and silver tongues, even as they fend off the advances of the nations in whose shadows their fledgling realms stand. While many nobly -or stubbornly- resist becoming puppets of these foreign powers, others gladly forsake their freedom, lulled by promises of prestige, profit, and protection.  Yet, despite all the countless attempts by forces within and without, the Crownlands refuse to be conquered.  This uncanny streak of luck more a function of the liberty-loving commoners than the brilliance or determination of their leaders, the locals of Arn are known for being fierce patriots, even if lackluster in their loyalty.  To the average citizen of Arn, neither blood nor banner determines a man's worth; instead, men are weighed by their behavior and beliefs.  As a consequence, natives care more about a person's character and less about the color of the flag that happens to fly over his or her homestead.  Pointing to the River Arn that winds it way across the emerald landscape, the locals argue that prosperity can only come so long as they are free to follow the currents of their own consciences.  And while more than a few Arnfolk are nothing but selfish rogues or hot-headed rabble-rousers, most are decent souls, content to plant their crops and plow their fields in peace, leaving others to their own affairs so long as they are left to theirs.  Nevertheless, the generally peaceful Crownfolk are more than willing and all-too capable of defending their farmsteads and freedom.  Even so, the land's lumber-rich forests and verdant fields continually call out to would-be-tyrants and conquerors alike.  For in the end, the Free Crownlands of Arn is a place where any man can become a king -or as some claim, where every man already is.</div></p>

<p><div style="text-align:center"><span style="font-weight:bold">Hedonic League of Athica</span><br />
<img src="http://i212.photobucket.com/albums/cc187/Dialexis/athica-2-1.jpg" alt="" class="bb-image" /></div></p>

<p><div style="text-align:justify;">In the Hedonic League of Athica, passions burn bright. From such raging fires, heroes are born and epic deeds are wrought. Skillfully spreading word of such legends, renowned poets and playwrights alike capture the hearts of Athica's inhabitants with sonorous instruments and half-submerged amphitheatres. Sculptors seal the glory of their subjects in sea-veined stone and shell, while architects erect iridescent monuments to their fame. Hoping to sway the minds of the ever-fickle populace, politicians and philosophers artfully blend sophistry, logic, and stagecraft into rhetoric that is as profound as it is persuasive. Beyond the city-states, where the clamor of civilization becomes sun-dapled glades of laurel, fig, and pomegranate, winsome fey dance and sing, ever beckoning passers-by to join their lusty revels. Yet, within Athica's highlands, piscine-tailed lamia, perverse ogres, and other monsters prey upon the weak and unwary. Beneath the sahuagin-haunted shores, sunken civilizations host ravenous sea hags, kapoacinths, locathahs, and ancient leviathans.  Facing these perils and more, the Athicans test their mettle. While most of these warriors are soon forgotten or only remembered as minor tragedies, a rare few rise to become living legends. Supposedly chosen by the enigmatic entities who slumber beneath Athica's isle or atop its towering mountains, these fate-touched heroes are endowed with strength and cunning above and beyond the common man. The inevitable heirs of the Athica's thrones, treasures, and troubles, these larger-than-life kings and queens of the Hedonic League rule with the knowledge that their country's crowns are rarely still. As a result, most live only for the moment, or seek a measure of immortality through daring campaigns and courageous quests. Playing to both strategies, feasts, games, and celebrations are common events. Either ignoring or embracing the excesses of their leaders, the common citizens of Athica plow their fields, tend their groves, and sail their ships with the simple aim of a comfortable life.  All of these goals, however, were threatened during the Barthrax Crisis.  Seeing Lambryss fall to inhuman foes, Athica's normally independent city-states decided to band together to create the Hedonic League.  So allied, the Athicans survived the devastating wars of the Drala's last stand and have since held Lambryss' hordes at bay.  Nevertheless, support for the Hedonic League has begun to waver.  Weary of protecting weaker settlements or being pawns to the most powerful city-states, an increasing number of Athicans criticize the confederacy and speak of secession.  Against this rising tide, the League's supporters point to the relative peace and prosperity the alliance has provided.  Meanwhile, demagogues stir the debate, rousing the land's raucous wine-merchants, pearl-adorned priests, and brine-soaked mariners alike.  Among such manipulators, Scelerians conspire with would-be-tyrants, Kheseph anarchists incite open rebellion, and Lambryssian warlords seek to weaken their western neighbor.  Yet, despite these divisions and devious influences, the hearts of the Hedonic League are united by their common yearning for greatness -and woe to any who stand in the way of an Athican's glory.</div></p>

<p><div style="text-align:center"><span style="font-weight:bold">The Sundered Dominions of Haziran</span><br />
<img src="http://i212.photobucket.com/albums/cc187/Dialexis/seige-1-1.jpg" alt="" class="bb-image" /></div></p>

<p><div style="text-align:justify;">Infidels and martyrs mingle inside the Sundered Dominions of Haziran.  Once the southwestern jewel of Nar-Qadam's crown, Haziran broke away after Bhalshazar's death.  Revoking their allegiance to the Sultanate, the local kings nevertheless remained allies of their eastern neighbor even as they fostered relations with countries across the seas.  While this policy made Haziran rich, the flow of coins came with a price, as Arelon’s missionaries arrived alongside its merchants. Though most ignored the evangelists, a few embraced the new religion -or at least pretended to, hoping to gain the Empyreans' favor. In time, these converts, alongside their church-building pastors, faced a backlash of violent persecution.  Hearing reports of this repression, the Prelatries sent a host of templars to protect their growing flock and foothold across the waters.  Reacting in kind, Nar-Qadam sent its own soldiers to safeguard its erstwhile subjects.  Torn between Arelon's heavenly mandate to redeem the world and Nar-Qadam's oath to remain free from supernal bondage, the Sundered Dominions became a battleground where casualties are measured in souls as well as lives.  Even today, amidst an all-too precarious armistice between the Prelatries and Sultanate, the contest for converts and coin continues.  Caught up in this centuries-old conflict, local rulers take sides, motivated by faith, tradition, greed, or simple survival.  Along the southern coasts, Empyrean crusaders and lordships loyal to Arelon prevail.  Patriarchs watch over the faithful from azure-domed cathedrals, while paladins escort pilgrims and parishioners to sacred shrines.  Church-allied caravans fill westbound caravels with glazed ceramics, jeweled rugs, and rare incense.  Within siege-worthy monasteries, monks blend olives, cloves, and basil into healing balms while priors read prayers from illuminated manuscripts.  'Advised' by the local clergy and foreign-born crusaders, an aristocracy of mixed bloodlines, broken dynasties, and tangled alliances maneuver to succeed the dying Leper-King of Jurapa.  Emptying his treasury, Haziran's southern monarch turns towns into fortresses and farmers into mercenaries.  Across the stronghold-studded frontlines, fortune-blessed soldiers return as scarred veterans while the ill-fated remain in shallow graves. Beyond the cypress-cut hills and dusty passes, the northern moorlands host Arelon's unyielding foes.  Inside palace-gardens of jasmine and myrrh, damask-adorned princes listen to the counsel, if not commands, of Nar-Qadam's viceroys.  Battling with words, if not blades, amongst themselves as well as the southern crusaders, the feudal warlords compete for territory as well as the loyalty of skilled minstrels, scholars, and physicians. Playing a critical role in such contests, assassins gather in secret citadels, hiring their dark services to any who pay sufficient tribute to the Sultanate.  Poisoning wells, burning caravans, and kidnapping nobles, these spice-addicted zealots terrorize the angel-worshipping invaders and all who aid them.  Meanwhile, mighty siege weapons roll across the plains as armies marshal for the armistice’s inevitable end.  Watching the smoke-filled horizon, the land's inhabitants pray for peace even as they prepare for the next war that awaits the Sundered Dominions of Haziran.</div></p>

<p><div style="text-align:center"><span style="font-weight:bold">Shifting Kingdoms of Kheseph</span><br />
<img src="http://i212.photobucket.com/albums/cc187/Dialexis/papyrusfloat-1.jpg" alt="" class="bb-image" /></div></p>

<p><div style="text-align:justify;">Monuments, mummies, and long-buried memories mark the Shifting Kingdoms of Kheseph.  Fed by the life-giving waters of the Tuat and Isertes, fertile riverbanks teem with fields of sedge, barley, and emmer.  Settlements of white-washed brick gleam in the blinding sun, while cities rise from emerald deltas, welcoming coin and cargo from far-away countries. Inside djed-pillared courtyards, sheer-robed dancers, sharp-rattling sistrum, and wanton celebrations entertain the wealthy.  Meanwhile, architects plan generation-spanning projects, caring little for cost or the countless slaves who erect the nation's legendary palaces and pyramids.  Soldiers guard flood-blessed granaries, armed with khopesh, javelins, and swift-flying arrows, while linen-swathed scribes stain papyrus-scrolls with tales of triumph and tragedy.  Barges drift down the Rivers of Blood and Milk, braving crocodiles, hippos, and other behemoths.  Yet, beyond the reed-filled riverbeds and lapis-blue water-lilies, Kheseph's soil withers to dust.  Drovers guide cattle, sheep, and goats through parched landscapes, watchful for jackals, giant scorpions, and worse.  Merchants cross dunes of swirling sand, their camels laden with gypsum, porphyry, and carnelian.  Deeper within Kheseph's foreboding deserts, riddle-twisting sphinx and statue-bound elementals defend time-buried tombs, temples, and treasuries.  Ruling over this land of silt and sand, kohl-eyed pharaohs adorn themselves with aromatic perfumes, ointments, and the arrogance of living gods. With loyalty waning and waxing like Kheseph's twin rivers, noble houses oversee the ancient provinces. Dynasties rise and fall like the desert sun, leaving scorched ruins in their wake.  Currently divided into four kingdoms, Kheseph wars amongst itself and its neighbors. Bordering the Golden Tribelands to the east, sun-blessed Serkheb shines, its markets gleaming with gold, incense, and ivory.  Yet, from the shadows, Scelerus tightens its coils around the Land of Scorpions, swaying the local poisoners, slavemasters, and snake-priests with silver-tongued promises and steel-tipped threats.  To the west, in the Carrion Lands of Neshen, slave revolts bathe the land in blood while vultures circle the cities, hungry for more.  Among the ravenous flock, phantoms from Ma'arath  feast on the ripening madness. Adding to the anarchy, the pharaohs of Amuth's past have awoken.  Sensing the weakness of their rivals, these unliving tyrants unleash hordes of mummies, flesh-eating scarabs, and necromantic plagues, devastating the lands both near and far.  Surrounded by such menaces, Meru's angelic dervishes dwindle, their numbers too few to defend the kingdom's shrinking borders.  Seeing the waning might of their moon-blessed guardians, the famed astrologers of the Sickle Lands watch the skies with increasing despair.   For within the Shifting Kingdoms of Kheseph, fate is written in the sand, twisting with each footstep of its would-be-champions and conquerors.</div></p>

<a href="http://img685.imageshack.us/i/lambryss.jpg/" class="bb-url"><img src="http://a.imageshack.us/img685/8941/lambryss.jpg" alt="" class="bb-image" /></a></div></p>

<p><div style="text-align:justify;">Its former glories mired in maze-like ruins, the Lost Isle of Lambryss is a land of forgotten mysteries and slumbering secrets.  Shrouded by mists, the jigsaw-like coasts of the Lost Isle are riddled with towering cliffs and lightless caverns.  Above the creeping fog, desolate cities lay in shambles, ravaged by war, wildfire, and rending tremors.  Eerily untouched by the wide-spread devastation are massive palaces that rise from the shattered settlements.  Claiming the painted pillars, blood-stained frescos, and treasure-laden halls as their own, cyclopean oracles languidly scan the vagaries of past and future while their lesser kin raid the highlands.  Living in the shadow of these one-eyed overlords, bandits, beasts, and black cults hide their secrets -and kill to keep them.  Blurring the lines between the three groups are the Horned Knights.  Once adored by the Empyrean Prelatries whom they served, these former templars of Arelon gained both fame and infamy for their bloody role in Haziran's crusades.  Their fall from grace a mystery most disturbing, the Horned Knights became a secretive order, obsessed with blasphemous rituals and bizarre relics.  As rumors of such dark deeds spread, the Horned Knights fled the sun-scorched battlefields of Haziran, taking their ill-gotten treasures with them.  Drawn to the Lost Isle, the fallen templars hid themselves and their riches.  Entombing the latter in trap-laden vaults of stone, spell, and steel, the Horned Knights allegedly left, dispersing to unknown regions -their departure as mysterious as their fall into darkness. Nevertheless, their treasures remain -as do the corpses of those who sought to claim them.  Below such strongholds and the rocky scrublands of the surface, labyrinthine tunnels snake and twist, connecting to Lambryss' countless sea-caves and salt-rimmed shores.  Inside this maze of sunless stone, the primary denizens of Lambryss dwell: the minotaurs.  Plying the coastline and beyond, the bullmen defend their darkened realms against fool-hardy explorers and would-be-liberators.  While fortunate trespassers are merely slaughtered and robbed, the truly luckless are brought back to the lairs of the beast-men.  There, amid ancient catacombs violently claimed from Lambryss' lost civilizations, the horned monsters offer living sacrifices to their secret lord.  Often leading such vile ceremonies and supplicants are the spawn of The Abyss, survivors of Lambryss' demon-purge during the last war.  Yet, despite all these perils, the desperate, daring, and demented continue to seek the accursed isle, drawn to the maddening mysteries that lurk within the Lost Isle of Lambryss.</div></p>

<p><div style="text-align:center"><span style="font-weight:bold">Whispering Wastes of Ma'arath</span><br />
<img src="http://i212.photobucket.com/albums/cc187/Dialexis/port.jpg" alt="" class="bb-image" /></div></p>

<p><div style="text-align:justify;">Wounds, madness, and worse haunt the Whispering Wastes of Ma'arath. Once the cradle of mighty civilizations, Ma'arath has become a grave of lost wonders. Towering ziggurats, crumbling tombs, and forsaken temples riddle the rocky wastelands. Ravaged by war, drought, and other disasters, these ruins bear grim testimony to Ma'arath's past glories and present troubles. Like an old salt-lick in the desert, the region has repeatedly drawn the ravenous, desperate, and dangerous to its once-fertile valleys. From Malgog's hordes to Kheseph's chariots, these foreigners have fed the blood-thirsty cycle of invasion, conquest, and assimilation. Yet, Ma'arath's most recent -and undeniably most devastating- incursion came not from their neighbors, but from the Lands Below. Unleashed by the divine battles of the Barthrax Crisis, a flood of horrors swept over the land.  In their wake, kings cursed their crowns to feast on grass like frothing beasts, fathers butchered their sons to feed strangers, and soldiers burned their own cities to battle the darkness of night.  As the aberrations spread beyond Ma'arath's borders, champions of order -both benevolent and tyrannical- sought to stem the unbridled tide of chaos. Leading their armies into the infested heart of the Whispering Wastes, these forces managed to seal the subterranean rifts and defeat the majority of the marauding monsters. For many, however, victory came too late. Moreover, the war was won, but peace did not follow. Instead, Ma'arath's 'liberators' looted the land of its greatest treasures, then abandoned it, leaving its few survivors to rebuild their broken homeland. Largely forsaking the inner lands, these humens eventually resettled beside the sea, and to this day, they try to piece together the torn fragments of their former lives. From half-sunk cities to settlements founded upon layers of rubble, the black-haired natives trade exotic dyes, wool, and salts for precious timber, wine, and steel. Inside idol-adorned temple-palaces, robed kings seek the wisdom of sooth-sayers, astrologers, and sorcerers, while tasseled scribes record and preserve these revelations upon clay tablets. Between dust-blown brick buildings and ragged tents, goats and cattle compete with the clamor of fishmongers, carpenters, and silversmiths. Misers cling to their coins while widows weep for all that is lost. Along the cedar-crowned coasts of the north, giants walk among the lesser races, ruling as generals or serving as slaves. To the south, bitter springs and brackish mires house horned boggards, gluttonous froghemoths, and noxious hezrou. Assassins and alchemists scour the land for rare poisons and deadly reagents. In the desiccated highlands, shedu and lammasu battle against brigands, black cults, and blood-obsessed priests. Driving these dark hearts to greater depravity are the phantoms of Ma'arath's tortured past -for like ghosts haunting an ill-kept grave, the spirits of the Lands Below refuse to rest.  Hissing from the dust, these and other menaces continue their relentless war upon the Whispering Wastes of Ma'arath and all that lies beyond in the World of Broken Dreams.</div></p>

<p><div style="text-align:center"><span style="font-weight:bold">The Enlightened Sultanate of Nar-Qadam</span><br />
<img src="http://i212.photobucket.com/albums/cc187/Dialexis/poptt-environment-17-1.jpg" alt="" class="bb-image" /></div></p>

<p><div style="text-align:justify;">Amid the shifting dunes, the Enlightened Sultanate of Nar-Qadam shimmers like a mirage, tempting and treacherous.  Born as a paradise of wish-wrought wonders, Nar-Qadam would be destroyed by the same genies who created it.  In time, Bhalshazar would claim the sandblasted wasteland as his own, his fiery hand forever branding the once-verdant region.  Yet, from the ashes of the sun god's pyre, the Enlightened Sultanate rose like a phoenix, alight with newborn life and power.  Since that time, Nar-Qadam's flame has burned bright -its light stretching to the seas, covering a host of lesser nations and climes.  To the west, emirates cling to the trade-rich shores, their sovereignty safeguarded so long as their souks stay open and their ports stay full.  In southern mountains of red-steel and molten rivers, thoqqua-riding dwarves bow to azer-born maliks while battling efreet, fire giants, and salamanders.  Along the southeast highlands and cypress-covered coasts, beys rule the local tribes, currying the favor -or avoiding the wrath- of the area's giant eagles, copper-winged simurgh, and wind-riding djinn.  Connecting all these lands is Nar-Qadam's sandswept heart.  Dune seas slither like sidewinders across the scorched soil, swallowing entire cities.  Salt flats, scorched forests, and streams of quicksand host lamia, rocs, dragonnes, and wandering jann.  Elven nomads nurture secret gardens of desert rose, date palm, and deep-rooted grass, while gnomes create alchemical oddities, gear-clicking constructs, and metallurgic marvels inside glass-domed enclaves.  Travelers ride camels, dune-sailing ships, and flying carpets, taking refuge from sandstorms and sun inside crowded caravanserais.  Oases stretch across the sands like strands of pearls, their marid-blessed waters controlled by an ever-shifting cartel of halfling shahs.  Within communities of roaming tents and settled stone, sheikhs govern with wise tongues and swift justice.  Pashas rule the richest provinces, served by seraglios, petty princes, and sinister assassins.  Commerce and culture flow into Nar-Qadam's capital, a city famous for its gleaming domes, delicate minarets, and heady spice-fields.  Inside, mystics ponder the stars while merchants haggle over trinkets and priceless treasures.  Hobgoblin slave-soldiers serve the sultan alongside shackled magi, seductive harems, and sly viziers.  Yet, for all his power, the sultan pales compared to the Parchment of Fire.  Once Bhalshazar's slave-girl, the legendary sorceress became Nar-Qadam's savior upon slaying the god-tyrant -and to this day, continues to fight for her people's freedom.  For the genies have not forgotten their former slaves and sovereignty, but constantly conspire to reclaim their lost thrones.  Dragons, blue and brass, battle for dominance amid the dunes and domed cities, hiding behind illusions and unwitting pawns.  Beneath the burning sands, the duruban's khalif attempts to seize the Sultanate and Scroll of Fire for himself.  To the northeast, the dreaded Sea of Ash spews ghouls, dracolichs, and other horrors, while to the southwest, Arelon's armies continue to march, causing Haziran's martyrs to cry for blood.  Against such foes, the Parchment of Fire's wrath is kindled -and with it, the Enlightened Sultanate of Nar-Qadam burns with a vengeance.</div></p>

<p><div style="text-align:center"><span style="font-weight:bold">The Desolate Shroudlands of Ras-Morthu</span><br />
<img src="http://i212.photobucket.com/albums/cc187/Dialexis/RasMorthu.jpg" alt="" class="bb-image" /></div></p>

<p><div style="text-align:justify;">Death rules the Desolate Shroudlands of Ras-Morthu. Its stench suffocates the realm's breathless air, saturates its grave-like soil, and stains its pallid streams. Before gods walked the world, beasts and bandits plagued the countryside. Later, when the Drala carved earthly empires into Oriund’s flesh, Ras-Morthu became a borderland where bickering godkings battled. Men and monsters followed in the wake of those wars, fleeing immortal tyrants to seek haven among the myriad battlefields and mass graves. In time, these forsaken souls took shelter amid subterranean catacombs shielded by spine-like tors. There, Ras-Morthu’s forefathers forged a confederacy of city-states where neither god nor priest reigned. Though this freedom allowed their society to develop unfettered by divine decree, it also caused the locals to increasingly question the afterlife. Seeking answers -or at least comfort- in complex funerary rituals, Ras-Morthu’s citizenry raised elaborate tombs and bone-etched libraries even as they became ardent disciples of necromancy. As generations passed, these ceremonies grew in complexity and grandeur, as did their arcana. Born of both pursuits were the ghosts who guided the confederacy, a counsel composed of each city's last monarch and covenanted to advise their heirs until the next generation took their place. While these macabre practices protected the locals for many years, the Shroudlands suffered horribly as the site of some of the Barthrax Crisis’ most devastating battles. Vast stretches of land withered to dust, cities were shattered, and entire populations were slaughtered. As gods turned the Shroudlands into their graves, death-curses tore through the realm’s ravaged soil, sky, and souls. Corpses rose in mockery of life. Wraiths and spectres wheeled the tattered sky. Against such terrors and more, Ras-Morthu’s survivors fled, sealing themselves in underground bastions. While some sought to wait out a storm that would never pass, others turned to their ancient lore, delving ever deeper in their necromantic arts in order to defend themselves. So armed, these practitioners managed to turn back the growing tide of undead. Abandoning the now-barren fields to the diverted, but far-from-defeated, hordes, Ras-Morthu’s still-living denizens settled inside the time-worn sepulchers and crumbling crypts of their broken, besieged cities. Maggots, mold, and rotting marrow became their sustenance. Despite these adaptations, death remained Ras-Morthu’s absolute, its greatest truth, mystery, and inevitability. Even today, the Shroudlands garner fame, if not notoriety, for their peerless morticians, meticulous bone-scriveners, and puissant necromancers. Grim and stoic, these figures maintain their vigil against Ras-Morthu’s unquiet graves, defending the realm’s eastern reaches with alchemical creations, monolithic ossuaries, and silver-edged steel. Further west, however, such guardians give way to Scelerian garrisons and the shambling zombies, ghouls, and worse they war against. Within this wasteland, foreboding castles and decadent manses house vampiric cabals, pitiless liches, and soul-drinking devourers. Despite these dangers, the living still seek their half-forgotten necropolises, haunted by the cries of their spectral kings and the deranged secrets they sometimes share. Manipulating all these forces and more, however, is Oriund’s first vampire, the former lover and forsaken traitor of Arelon’s greatest saint. Unsleeping inside her death-stained homeland, this clandestine despot dreams of expanding the Desolate Shroudlands of Ras-Morthu till all of creation is smothered beneath oblivion’s dark veil.</div></p>

<p><div style="text-align:center"><span style="font-weight:bold">Umbral Wasteland of Sha'al</span><br />
<img src="http://i212.photobucket.com/albums/cc187/Dialexis/scapeumbravolcano-1.jpg" alt="" class="bb-image" /></div></p>

<p><div style="text-align:justify;">Casting its dark shadow upon the world, the Umbral Wasteland of Sha'al is cloaked by a suffocating ring of lifeless mountains and crumbling peaks. Smothering the land with oppressive smoke and eternal twilight, volcanoes hiss their poisonous vapors into a sky that continually sheds tears of blinding soot. Beyond lurid lightning storms, only a grey and umber-streaked mockery of sunlight seeps through the smog. Razor-sharp scree, spurs, and ridgelines snake across the spell-scarred land. Fallen ash clings to the barren soil, choking life from all but the most twisted and monstrous of creatures. The central, cauldron-like valley is riddled with cracks and rents that perpetually weep Sha'al's molten blood, causing the basin to constantly shed and reform its tortured visage. Claiming this nightmarish realm as its own, a dark aspect of Zul rules the Umbral Wasteland alongside a cabal of extremely powerful, if perverse, practitioners of shadow magic. Having steeped their souls in the dark essence of the Demiplane of Shadow, Sha’al’s rulers –otherwise known as the Sha’alyx- are pale, but puissant, mockeries of their once-mortal selves.  From their spell-warded fortresses and fell towers among the peaks, the Shadowlords of Sha'al govern their abject minions with malevolence and terror. Worn-down sapiens, dwarves, and goblin-blooded subjects huddle inside subterranean cities where air, light, and hope are but hollow phantoms.  From such miserable settlements, luckless souls toil amid sprawling spider-beds: immense areas where shadow-bred arachnids are raised as mounts as well as sources of silk, venom, and sustenance.  Deeper into the lightless depths, other ill-fated mortals delve in search of precious metals, minerals, and magical foci.  Acting as cruel taskmasters and pitiless wardens, drow, giants, fiends, gloom dragons, and other umbral abominations slavishly serve the whims of the Sha'alyx. When not consumed by their internecine conflicts, the Shadowlords and their immortal master seek to manipulate the world from the very shadows they summon -a mission that the Shinning Legions and other champions of righteousness seek to foil at every turn. Fortunately for Oriund, the forces of light generally succeed. Unfortunately, they don't always. Sometimes, the Umbral Wasteland of Sha'al wins -or, as the Sha'alyx whisper in their dark tongue, <span style="font-style:italic">"Every sun must set, every dawn must die with dusk."</span></div></p> <div class="dice_rolls">
