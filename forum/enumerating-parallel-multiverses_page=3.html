         <p>Parallel XXXVIII: The War of Parted Lovers</p>

<p><em>"What is this life that pulls me far away?</p>

<p>What is that home where we cannot reside?</p>

<p>What is that quest that pulls me onward?</p>

<p>My heart is full when you are by my side -</p>

<p>Calling, yearning, pulling, home to you..."<br />
   -Loreena McKennitt, 'Caravanserai'</em></p>

<p>It began with the dissolution of Apophis. Ra stood mystified on his celestial barge, his body of luminous golden light bleeding solar flares from his wounds. Every time before, meaning every day's dawning, the Serpent's blood would boil out and the ruby clouds of steam would settle on the sun god's flesh as Ra's morning dew.</p>

<p>Every time before, the blood would close his wounds as if flesh were but parted liquid. But in what was clearly their final battle Ra had watched with raptor eyes wide with wonder as blood had become sea water, as scales had become sea foam and bones had turned to brittle souvenirs of coral.</p>

<p>The eyes of Apophis became two black pearls - never had his enemy's eyes so resembled his own. Ra had summoned those pearls into his barge and continued in his daily passage across from horizon to horizon. If any of the billions of worlds whose daylight depended on him noticed the delay in the sun's rising it troubled only the wisest and the most sensitive to the interplay of divine and mortal realms.</p>

<p>The next dawn, which is the dawn of a billion mortal worlds, it was Horus who took up the Barge of the Sun as Ra slept as Thoth and Isis sought to stem the fire that leaked out of their pantheon's godhead.</p>

<p>Ra did not awaken that day, or the next, and on the ninth day since Apophis's death Osiris welcomed the god into his realm. The soul of the god had gone to its rest.</p>

<p>On the tenth day, Geb proclaimed that he and Nut should be together now that the reign of Ra had ended. Isis and Osiris, themselves painfully parted loves, sided with Geb and his wife. Seker found Geb's proclamation disrespectful and Anubis even spoke from the Astral to state that Ra's judgement should stand. Bast believed the lovers' should be reunited, and Set said the judgement of Ra should stand, likely out of spite more than any respect for Ra. </p>

<p>Shu, surprisingly, was one of the gods who abstained from saying yea or nay on the matter. Though he did not give his opinion, he continued to hold the Geb and Nut apart with his power and still does so.</p>

<p>Horus, Ra's successor, was still assuming the powers of his office and was angered by the presumption of the other gods. He might have decided the matter single handedly, but Thoth who had once bent Time itself for the lovers had now given them each a share of power bled from the body of Ra.</p>

<p>With Thoth's ibis head being shorn from his neck, the War of Parted Lovers began.</p>

<p>=-=-=</p>

<p>State of the Planes: Give the pervasiveness of the Pharaonic gods and their followers, the inter-pantheon civil war has dragged much of creation into violence. The Blood War continues but both sides in the now greater conflict, the War of Lovers, have taken it upon themselves to teleport whole legions of fiends near the realms of their enemies. This has made both the devils and demons wary of gathering in open legions without the backing of a deity on the planes of their conflict.</p>

<p>More troubling is that the Upper Planes quake with the warring of the pantheon's legions. As more and more mortals die, more soldiers appear in the planes of Paradise to serve as the soldiers of their gods.</p>

<p>Of great insult to Horus was the untethering of Ra's former realm from Arcadia. Once he killed Thoth Orisis and Isis allowed Heliopolis to shift across the Upper Planes to Ysgard, the plane that most closely matched Horus's alignment. Not only did this leave the realm vulnerable to the violent forces of that plane, but it also was a symbolic insult in that a chaotic power was hardly one to enforce his predecessor's lawful edicts.</p>

<p>That Horus is their son is now a mark of shame to Isis and Osiris, for the blood of wise Thoth is on his hands.</p>

<p>Though Ra's soul passed through Osiris's realm on the way to some Other reality, his corpse shines golden and hot against the cool argent of the Astral Void. Anubis watches over it, for while he supported the dead god's ruling the jackal headed guardian of the divine graveyard will not let forces from either side draw on the energies still contained in Ra's dead body. Every day hundreds of exemplar legions are culled from the the corpse's vicinity, though many wonder how long Anubis can resist the will of so many gods unaided.</p>

<p>What is perhaps more unusual is that Thoth's corpse has not appeared in the Astral, though his priests no longer receive any spells from him and it is clear his realm is fading away. Stranger still is that his proxies retain their power - if anything, the observant might note, they seem to now radiate with divine magics.</p>

<p>More troubling for his worshipers is the lack of inspiration that has beset them and that the ability to commune with Thoth's incredible mind and its knowledge of planar history is gone. </p>

<p>The War of Parted Lovers has resulted in the domains of the gods turning into weapons across the worlds. Horus cannot restrict the sun from rising on the pantheon's worlds, but it glares in the eyes of the "rebel" gods' peoples. Isis, with the aid of Azuth and Mystra, is turning arcane magic against those who side with Horus. Geb attacks the people who've sided with Horus with earthquakes, and Nut strikes them down it lightning.</p>

<p>Because Bast sided with Geb and Nut, and thus against Horus, it seems many hawks in the Multiverse are hunting cats in the wild and in the streets of and rooftops of the cities. </p>

<p>The priesthoods of Set have pushed their way to legitimacy in many worlds as the pantheon's worshipers have been forced to choose sides in the War. Similarly, in many places the worshipers of Geb and Nut specifically are blamed for the shifting tides of misfortune and often abused or run off from their homes. Many have fled into the crypts of their peoples, seeking protection from the living and finding it in the arms of Osirs's dead. Where need is great, his priests are being granted mummy-hood and lichdom in droves which has led to the paladins of Seker declaring war against all of the White Crown's worshipers.</p>

<p>Where Horus's power is strongest, all those who are said to follow the "rebel" gods have been tossed into dungeons. Given that many worshiped the pantheon as a whole this has led to no end of administrative headaches and rampant corruption as merchants and nobles alike seek to rid themselves of long standing rivals.</p>

<p>A great number of the pantheon are providing some measure of aid to both sides or neither. Many are unsure how to proceed, for while they pity Geb and Nut they acknowledge Horus as the rightful heir to Ra. Yet if their pantheon is to retain its strength across the Multiverse it will need a greater power at its head, and thanks to Thoth Horus can only claim to be an intermediate power at best.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>The last post (and probably several before it as this is one thread that I can't seem to keep up with considering how much is posted) made me think of one of the ideas that I've been trying to incorporate in my campaign.</p>

<p>Since the planes are all about belief, I am actually trying to make the planes correspond in different ways for different ideologies. For example, I would have a Norse character visiting the Outlands to see the trunk of Yggdrasil reaching off into infinity not the stone Spire. For him, the Spire would truly conform in all ways to an impossibly large tree (e.g. might have moss growing on the side of it, etc.). And there might be carverns at the base of the "trunk" that would lead into Nifelheim in the Wastes (and to him, the other two layers of the Wastes would appear to be "suburbs" or lesser offshoots of Nifelheim)</p>

<p>I was trying to think of other things to tie in from other pantheons such as Ra making a night trip along the River Styx before "climbing" back to the skies of the Upper Planes.</p>

<p>Does anyone have interesting parallels along these lines?</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I actually really like the idea, and would love to have a parallel where all the mythological journeys and events the gods do keep the world going were represented.</p>

<p>At the moment, sadly, I have no idea what to suggest. BUT -&gt;</p>

<p>Clueless posted a few World Tree Analogues in the Open Design project, they might be a good place to start:</p>

<p>"In addition to the Norse version, the World Tree also appears in Hungarian myth ( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_mythology#The_mythology_in_brief" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_mythology#The_mythology_in_brief"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_mythology#The_mythology_in_brief">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_mythology#The_mythology_in_brief</a></a> ), Slavic and Finnish myth ( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavic_mythology#Cosmology" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavic_mythology#Cosmology"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavic_mythology#Cosmology">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavic_mythology#Cosmology</a></a> ), and Hindu as Ashvattha ( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashvattha" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashvattha">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashvattha</a> ). "</p>

<p>In the same project Mount Sumeru was mentioned, it is the axis mundi in Buddhism (not sure how pervasive it is): <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumeru" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumeru">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumeru</a></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Had one occur to me at work today:</p>

<p>Parallel XXXIX: The Storms of Pandemonium</p>

<p>Have you been living under a rock somewhere or are you just addlecoved?  How can you not know about what's been going on?  Fine.  Here's the dark of it, as I understand it.</p>

<p>Nobody's quite sure what exactly happened.  Chant has it that some barmy greybeard figured out how to open a permanent two-way link between Pandemonium and the plane of Storms. That'd be the elemental plane of Lightning to you, Clueless.  Oh good, you do know about that.  Anyway, all anybody is really certain of is that about twelve years ago, a demon windstorm broke out across the planes.  That'd be both the Outer and Inner planes.  </p>

<p>Madness infected Lightning and spread through Air, Smoke and Steam like a plague.  The borders between those four planes just plain broke down, and apparently the whole place is now just an insane swirl.  A group calling themselves the Lords of the Storm started riding out and conquering the adjacent planes.  They say these guys are unstoppable, and the mere fact that I've heard stories about Marids fighting along side the Efreet makes me wonder if there's something to that.  They also say that winds now howl through the Deep Delve, like the place was sodding Pandemonium.  I ain't never been there, so I can't tell you if that's true or not.  But, given everything else that's going on, I got no reason to not believe it.</p>

<p>Anyway, that's what's going on on the Inner Planes.  What happened to the Outer planes is just barmy.  Fr'instance, didja know you can see all the planes of the Great Wheel from the Outlands here?  Look over there.  That's Mount sodding Celestia.  And that over there?  The four peaks of Gehenna, and yeah, they're all sodding erupting now.  And that swirl of madness over there.  Don't look too long.  I've seen cutters stronger than you go completely mad after looking it a little bit too long.  Best as I can figure, that swirl is somehow Pandemonium, Limbo and the Abyss, all mixed up together.</p>

<p>Got that all in your braincase?  Good, now look past all the scenery.  See that stormcloud?  Do you see where it ends?  You're right, it doesn't.  That damn thing has been gathering since that windstorm.  Every now and again, an arm of it drifts out over the planes and everything in its path...changes.  I can't explain what that means exactly.  It's just something that you're gonna have to experience for yourself, but you'll know it when you come across it.  It's like the places that have been touched by the storm have been unstuck.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, by the way, the Blood War ended.  After that windstorm, all the drive seemed to go out of the Ta'anari and they retreated.  Thinking they had won, the Baatezu gathered their numbers together, and in an onslaught worthy of epic poetry, pressed onwards to the Abyss.  Nobody quite knows what happened, but to a one, the armies were defeated, driven back and driven mad.  Now, there's sodding devils wandering the planes, attacking anything and everything that strikes them as needing to be attacked.  There are rumors circulating that Solars are working with the four remaining Lords of the Nine in an effort to control their wayward numbers and to bring some semblance of sanity back to the planes.  Yeah, I said four.  The others are either dead, missing or barmy.  Yeah, a barmy Lord of the Nine wandering the planes.  That’ll give anybody nightmares.</p>

<p>Let’s see.  Inner…Outer…the Blood War…what else?  Oh, the factions.  Yeah, they’re mostly still around.  There’re a few new ones these days.  The Cult of Ragnorak.  They’re big on Ysgard, obviously, though they’re really more of a sect.  Basically, they’re a bunch of barmies who’re convinced that the big doomsday show-down is immanent and they’re doing everything they can to ready themselves to fight alongside the powers against their enemies.  Come to think of it, there are more than a few of these doomsday groups.  Some are doing their best to break open Carceri.  Chant has it, they’ve already managed to free a titan or two.</p>

<p>Near as anybody can tell, the Guvners have been hard at work trying to figure out a way to bring things back under control.  The Hardheads are still around, trying to convince everybody that they already have everything under control.  Pike ‘em both.  </p>

<p>The Society of Sensation has now become the Society of Bacchus. Yeah, these days, in the face of seeming Armageddon, they’re less about experiences and more about hedonism.  The Bleakers and the Dusties have seen their numbers rise for much the same reason.  People deal with the end of times in their own way.</p>

<p>The Xaositects have surged, of course.  Can’t throw a rock without hitting one these days.  They’ve more or less taken over Sigil, if you can believe that.</p>

<p>Oh Sigil!  How could I forget Sigil?! I’m such a sodding idiot.  Look up at the Spire there, berk.  You see that purplish-bluish glow?  Yeah, that’s the city.  These days we call Sigil “The Storm Cage”.  You know why?  It’s cause the entire city is encircled with lightning.  And Her Serenity sits in the middle of the city’s airspace, acting as some kind of sodding lightning rod.  I don’t know why she’s doing it, but ever since lightning first started surrounding the city, and a few stray strikes burned down the Hive, that’s all she does.</p>

<p>And the Dabus.  They’ve gone barmy too.  They build up and tear down buildings like you’d expect, but they work over top of one another.  One puts a board up, and another tears it away.  They’ve also built whistles and pipes to catch the wind and play a sort of music.  They also put up sculptures that don’t look like anything I’ve ever seen.  Abstract-like, I mean.  And the towers they’ve built lately.  I’m sure that if you could somehow get outside the city and look down, it’d look like the spokes of a wheel.  The Xaositects, of course, love the madness in the city now and “help” the Dabus with their constructions.  Madness.</p>

<p>So yeah, that’s the screed.  You planning on writing a book or something?  You’ve taken an awful lot of notes there.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Parallel XL: The Sundered Planes</p>

<p>Sigil? Well, yeah, it exists, but we don't bother with it anymore. Not since the Multiverse started tearing apart.</p>

<p>See there are breaches that connect the planes now, and so places like the Cage and the Gate Towns don't see as much traffic. Why bother with a portal when you can lead whole legions through a rift?</p>

<p>The first one? That one was between Fire and Ice, and that war is still going on. Might be good for the arm chair generals, seeing as a rift between the Grey Waste and the Beastlands turned the Blood War into the battle between yugoloths and the Innocence of the Happy Hunting Grounds. If nothing else, at least the essence of the Wild and Innocence of animals has brought emotion to the Wastes and got the Baern running scared....At least, that is what I hope the gradual retreating of the yugoloths and mortai claiming the grey skies means.</p>

<p>The Plane of Vacuum has swallowed bits of Positive Material, clouds of Radiance, as well as varied Prime Material worlds...who knows what will come of that.</p>

<p>The Negative Material Plane has bled from various breaches into the Ethereal Plane, resulting in a surge of incorporeal undead across the Prime.</p>

<p>The thinnest of cuts has supposedly linked the depths of the Abyss to the Order of Mechanus. If nothing else Orcus has apparently allied with -or perhaps found himself dominated by - Primus, who is even now sending hordes of modrons into Thanatos. Its exact plans remain unknown.</p>

<p>Another rumor is that Chronias now shines the light of Ultimate Good and Order into the swirling lunacy of the Far Realms.</p>

<p>The Styx is being diluted by the Plane of Water, and Oceanus is leaking into the Plane of Shadow.</p>

<p>Cubes of Acheron are floating off into the Astral, drifting amongst the corpses of gods.</p>

<p>The Temporal Prime has conjoined the past, present, and future of several worlds.</p>

<p>That's just the examples off the top of my head. But hey, just take a stroll through any of the planes and you're sure to bump into a breach - There are news one appearing everyday even as all sorts of forces - elementals, celestials, fiends, jinn, mercane, spellweavers, aboleths -work hard to close off the old ones.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I could probably refine it a bit, as I was writing it on the fly, but I like the core of what I have in there.  I think I'd really like to play up the whole "These are the end times" feeling more.  I envision that particular parallel as being home to any number of doomsday sects/cults, each earnestly working on bringing about their own particular brand of Armageddon.  Beliefs on the planes being what they are, what happens if the majority of people start believing that the end of creation is at hand?</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>That would be scary - we believe in the End, so the End happens. I do think there are limits to belief though, especially its ability to effect the inner planes - though of course each parallel is different.</p>

<p>One thing I really like about parallels is what you mention - there are so many interesting what-ifs, not the least of which are end-time scenarios and Wheel spanning conflicts. Does Io take over the Multiverse? Does Primus consume all into Order?</p>

<p>There were lots of seeds over the years for crazy stuff that might tip the scales of planar life, parallels are an opportunity to play through them.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Parallel XLI: The Spirit Ocean</p>

<p>The crystal spheres here have a calligraphy of glyphs etched on the outside, nation spanning lettering interlocked into blazing wards that light the spiritual waters around them.</p>

<p>The Spirit Ocean is an infinite expanse of breathable yet murky water clouded by ether and shadow. Utilizing the dimensional currents allows one to travel via spelljammer submersible across distances that would otherwise take millennia or longer to traverse.</p>

<p>While predators of all sorts are a concern, the greatest threat as well as the staunchest allies lie in the cities that lie upon or within the gargantuan fauna and flora, those forces that necessitated the wards upon the crystal spheres.</p>

<p>Hippocampi with starlit fur and moonshine scales, kraken with tentacles grasping artifacts of healing and truth, tyrannical sea turtles carrying the cities of devils on their shells, ever twisting eternally spreading forests of madness inducing coral, beds of entangling sea weed all to willing too entrap souls by utilizing the cruelest illusions - all these and more are the representations of alignment within this Multiverse. Some serve as land for the fortresses of fiends or cities of celestials while others are the realms of the gods.</p>

<p>Within the crystal spheres, behind the protections carved out by mysterious benefactors, are the equivalent of Prime Material Worlds. However, these worlds are also the originating forces for the elements, and thus one sees mortal humanoids interacting with elementals and jinn. Sometimes there are wars, though such wars are not always between the elemental and mortal. Other times there is peace and occasionally united, civilized empires.</p>

<p>Sigil leads to the backs, underbellies, and innards of the great flora and fauna of Alignment. The city is built on the inner circumference of a torus, but as there is no Spire no one is sure where it is. Attempts to dig through the streets results in being mazed in a lightness labyrinth of heat leeching ice.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Parallel XLIII: The Contest (Rip already did 42)</p>

<p>There are only seven known sapient beings here - the rest is your run of the mill flora and fauna found on Multiverse Prime.</p>

<p>There are no dabus, razor vine has choked the Cage and the Lady seems unconcerned by the strangulation. You'll see her Serenity floating around her empty city, not bothering with the other six sentients who know better than to risk her ire as they make use of the portals.</p>

<p>The Six are incredibly powerful immortals with incredible magic at their disposal. Each of the six seeks the capture of the others - to kill one of the Six is to ensure they reappear fully restored in some unpredictable corner of this Wheel.</p>

<p>Though the Six retain their memories, the form of their reincarnation varies - a slaughtered ogre might return as a pixie or a dragon. Oftentimes one of the Six, finding himself or herself in an unfavorable form, will seek out some plant or animal to destroy the body and thus allow him or her to enter a new one.</p>

<p>Every time a body of the Six is killed, that particular person finds his or her skills and prowess greatly diminished. Such knowledge and training can be recovered, depending on the form, but during these years they are particularly vulnerable.</p>

<p>If there are more contestants, they are unknown at this time.</p>

<p>The Six, in their current forms, exist as follows:</p>

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Hainnor the Great, Archmage of Storms, Master of Wind and Flame, and Diabolist of the Three Circles - No matter what form Hainnor took over the years, he always found a way to use powerful magic in his struggle against the other five, whether as a savage Minotaur Shaman, a High Elf Wizard with classic spell mastery, or a Pit Fiend conjuring fiendish animals to his side. In his most recent incarnation, Hainnor appeared as... a domestic dog. He's more or less a large mutt in appearance, with big floppy ears, a brown and black coat, and a fairly long, round snout. He can speak all the languages he's ever known, but has so far had trouble reclaiming his magical powers. However, in the meantime, he discovered an abandoned mortal city from long ago and found that it was <span style="font-style:italic">wonderful.</span> The smell of the flowers growing through the cracks in the stone, the adrenaline-pumping sensation of hunting the numerous rats, the primal satisfaction of marking and defending his territory from another dog. While Hainnor's powerful mind has not slipped into a bestial state, he is beginning to think he <span style="font-style:italic">enjoys</span> this life more than he ever did the great contest. The man inside the dog is still torn, but he wonders if he might not be able to escape notice in this form, spend his days roaming this city, and maybe the next, and perhaps the next after that if he has time. Siring puppies, discovering new smells... it all sounds remarkably pleasant, with no worries about eternal captivity or being Mazed by the Lady on some poor decision. </p>

<p>Of course, if he does decide that the contest is more important than all this, there are always the wolves roaming the broken city, ready to send him on his way.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Parallel XLIII: Contestant #2</p>

<p>Kitteran the Chain Skinned: Whether she is a an aboleth, a bodak, a giant amoeba, a disenchanter or a prismatic dragon as is her current form, Kitteran always is marked by the fine golden links that interweave themselves into and over her flesh.</p>

<p>The chains somehow preempt binding Kitteran, who is already bound to herself in some arcane paradox that the other contestants have as yet been unable to unravel. This mystic recursion of continually triggered contingencies has made Kitteran rather insane and thus more  loquacious than the other five and certainly more talkative than the Lady of Pain.</p>

<p>Kitteran has spoken of the others and herself as the "pact-bound" and the prize as the "root-trunk of the branching histories".  Note that the "pact-bound" sometimes includes the Lady as well, but never when Kitteran is asked about it in Sigil. The Chain Skinned has also referred to the Wheel upon which the game is played as the "purposed reflection" and when asked about what happened to everyone - gods, archfiends, mortals, the Concordance of Celestials - she laughed mockingly at the "necessity of history in dreams".</p>

<p>Kitteran's comments led the chronomancers of the Fate Breakers to discovering that time travel is impossible, and temporal scrying cannot look forward and looking back only shows the Contest being played without any hint as to its inception. At which point the Architects of Infinity began to wonder if this Wheel is in fact a constructed copy of some other Multiverse with all sapients save the six contestants and the Lady removed. </p>

<p>While she enjoys the company Kitteran refuses to speak further on the subject, repeating herself once before chastising visitors for distracting her with questions about origins when victory should be the sole concern. For someone mentally touched, Kitteran plays the game incredibly well. Her resistance to binding allows her to be more direct in seeking out the others who are more prone to using armies consisting of some combination of constructs and charmed non-sentient life.</p>

<p>Kitteran enjoys the use of arcane enhancement, transfiguration, and abjurations. When witnessed in direct battle with the other five, Kitteran was a jovial and sporting combatant, apparently bearing no ill will towards the others.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>"Remember, it's all just a mirror we made to see ourselves in."<br />
  -Invisibles</p>

<p>I am Rune and I am Musical Note and I am letter of Ink...</p>

<p>I am Fey and I am Leviathan-Behemoth-Whale and I am bastard child + secret shame of Griffon and Horse.</p>

<p>I am a woman grown, rising from grass, drops of my own urine racing down my legs, but I remember the budding of sloping but unobtrusive mole-hill breasts and the shoots of hair prickling the valley between my round, kissing close thighs.</p>

<p>I remember being an eagle headed foal clawing through the womb of a mare and I remember a crown set on my head as prince of the Seelie. I am a calf in a salt water world, the girth of my cetacean mother dwarfing nations.</p>

<p>But I have no past, even as my memories glitter in the depths of the recorder stones. My own secret fortress, infinitely recursed to infinitesimal proportions in what seems to be the Sigilian headquarters of the Society of Sensation.</p>

<p>I come here to remember that I am Nydra, and to forget for a moment that I must never let myself be caught - that I should bleed myself or burn myself or explode into chunks of muscle and shards of bone rather than feel the clamp of a shackle or the weight of a ward.</p>

<p>Do the others remember lives never lived? Do they follow the map of their memories to unearth artifacts that have never been made but still lie in ruins and crypts guarded only by supposedly "non-sentient" life? </p>

<p>Whoever made the rules never owned a dog, that's for sure. But then again, I probably never owned one either...</p>

<p>I don't think the others remember the memories of their forms. I don't think the others can find the eye that (maybe?) never lay in a socket, the hand that (perhaps?) never connected to the bones of a wrist. I don't think they could give them to <a href="forum/enumerating-parallel-multiverses_page=1#comment-62841" class="bb-url">Laquera</a> and thus make a new friend who promises to help me win the contest...I think Laquera is more real than anyone, because she is always giving orders to herself, always attended by her selves young and old...</p>

<p>I don't think Laquera should give a dead man's eye to a child, but we don't know each other so well so I keep my mouth shut. I don't want to lose such a valuable friend.</p>

<p>Still, I can't wait until the contest is over. I can always be friends with the rest of the Laqueras, so you couldn't even really say I murdered the one that was the meanest.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Parallel XLIII: Contestant #4</p>

<p>"I love a challenge, and saving the Earth is a probably a good one."<br />
 -Six Ways Mushrooms Can Save the World: <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/paul_stamets_on_6_ways_mushrooms_can_save_the_world.html" title="http://www.ted.com/talks/paul_stamets_on_6_ways_mushrooms_can_save_the_world.html">http://www.ted.com/talks/paul_stamets_on_6_ways_mushrooms_can_save_the_w...</a></p>

<p>When I awoke, I thought for a moment I'd been buried alive. I thought I was frozen, unmoving, tasting the rotting alchemical waste of untold generations. This seeping garbage affected my own arcana, preventing the triggering of my contingencies. Unable to even destroy the body I now inhabited, and thus reincarnate, I thought the contest had been lost.</p>

<p>As none of my rivals came to gloat, my panic settled, and finally the revelation came: I had not lost. </p>

<p>Rather, I had been dealt a winning hand.</p>

<p>=-=-=</p>

<p>Most survivors of the Cleansing worship me as Tohgrut  the Omnipresent, and surprisingly I have come to the find that through the ingestion of my flesh a communion opens between me and my priestly vessels. I can grant spells to my chosen hunters, allowing them to utilize arcana via new born instincts.</p>

<p>But my body, of which my ambulatory children take part daily, that is my true miracle.</p>

<p>I feed the starving, and give revelation to the worthy. My stalks pierce the earth and offer up my majesty to all who are willing.</p>

<p>The druidic prophecies in empty aboreal libraries denounce me as aberration, but have I not healed what they could not...and is not their lack of presence proof of their failure? </p>

<p>=-=-=</p>

<p>The wolf, the bat, the beetle and and the dolphin. All come to know themselves as my spores carry the gift of my consciousness across the planet. Apes rebuild ruins with the aid of messenger birds and varied beasts of burden. </p>

<p>There are clerics and mages now among the animal kingdoms, the truly blessed who have survived taking in my flesh and let my mycelium wrap around their veins and bond with their nerves.  The less fortunate still have a part to play, their corpses the soil in which new aspects of my divinity grow.</p>

<p>These mycanoids are myself born anew, the ones I have remade the world for. I am their Alpha and Omega. </p>

<p>=-=-=</p>

<p>Let the others come, let them come and face the glory of Myself, the Lord of the World and One true God of this Multiverse.</p>

<p>=-=-=</p>

<p>One of my mycanoid children vanished, and I felt as if an eye had been plucked out of the body of a previous incarnation.</p>

<p>=-=-=</p>

<p>My child was lost, and now is found. It tells me not of other worlds, but other Wheels...other Multiverses waiting for the Revelation....</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Parallel XLIII: Contestant #5</p>

<p>Chentatel</p>

<p>Those other fools have it all wrong. It's not about magical power, sheer physical might, or even knowing the best routes to travel the planes. The Contest has less to do with defeating the others, and everything to do with not being defeated.</p>

<p>Chentatel has honed its skills as an escape artist first and foremost. Some incarnations, it merely does its best to avoid capture, escaping snare after plot after trap before the other contestants even realize Chentatel is on the same plane. Other times it has willingly let itself get caught - the fools are far more likely to divulge information about their own schemes once they believe they have Chentatel firmly in their grip. Once it's learned all it can, it slips away again, using the new knowledge to outmaneuver the others. The best part of the contest is that, since forms change every time, most of Chentatel's foes have yet to figure out it even exists as a distinct entity. Rather, they blame each distinct escape as bad luck or poor planning on their own parts. </p>

<p>An interesting thought, if you like, is that Chentatel's current incarnation has willingly become "blessed" by Tohgrut. Through a series of magical tricks and intense mental disciplines, it has managed to maintain its own will and hide its true identity, while gaining immense knowledge from its association with the fungal network. These other Wheels could be truest escape Chentatel has ever dreamed of...</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Parallel XLIII: Contestant #6</p>

<p>Annael</p>

<p>You can hide a whisper in a symphony, a cube of sugar in a sea of salt. But for what I am composing, for my masterpiece...such a thing could only be hidden in the boundaries of an infinite Wheel.</p>

<p>I walk into the unmanned mists of Raven's Loft and bend the land of my domain, birthing canyons that blush with the emergence of calligraphy. I walk out and enter the Caverns of Thought, finding their center so that I might focus the scattered animal attentions of its gray matter to streaks of tarnish painted in the distant reaches of the Astral Void.</p>

<p>I die and come back, I swim and crawl and fly as serpent as xorn as djinn. I write, and I paint, and I sculpt. The fractures of crystal upon the plains of Mineral, the hoof beats of horses on the snow, the turn of a gear in Mechanus and the currents just under the surface of a billion oceans. The cry of the osprey and the fall of a thousand redwoods into Hell's fallow Pit of Flame. </p>

<p>All are stanzas in my miraculous poetry, all are movements in a dance that confines.</p>

<p>The kernel, the center of my works is arcana not my own. A ribbon of unfading echo that quivers like flesh in ecstasy, thrumming that lends shivers to Her shadow on the cobbles. All of Sigil is a spell unlike any other, magic that I will answer with my own and so make the City of Doors the lynchpin to my own plane-spanning Cage.</p>

<p>I am weaving a web made from Everything, and every day my supposed rivals tangle themselves freely while daring to think they are players instead of prey.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>This is a complete ripoff... but i thought it would fit nicely... </p>

<p>I hide in the last place you would ever look, I am your greatest enemy. Would you look into yourself, in your own mind for an enemy? and would you look behind the masks of greed and fear?</p>

<p>I am the greatest player of the greatest game, I am the biggest con of all cons... where does the game begin and where does it stop? </p>

<p>There is always an opponent and a victim, the trick is to know when you are the latter, so that you may become the former.</p>

<p>But you see my greatest trick of all, was to convince you, that I am you so that you may listen to my voice and do as I please. </p>

<p>(total ripoff from Revolver, the enemy is EGO, this contestant has learned how to slip into your mind and affect your greed, fears, desires and talk to your mind nudging you in his desired directions.)</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Heh, weird as it was I liked the premise of the movie though I wasn't 100% sold on the execution.</p>

<p>It would be interesting if there was some bizarre conditioning/compulsion that makes the contestants play the game. </p>

         <p><em>Yes Wicke, you should do another summary to match your awesome previous entries!</em></p>

<p>Parallel XLIV: The Lady is Naked, But Veiled by Stone.</p>

<p>Sigil is a collection of stone plinths rising up out of white sand. The plinths are the width and height of a half-giant. The sound of lapping tides and the smell of salt spray are everywhere, but no one has ever found the ocean shore. The sunlight always shines silver through the perpetual cloud cover.</p>

<p>Each plinth has a keyhole. Put the key in, turn it, and the plinth becomes viscous in the manner of honey. Walk into the stone and arrive at your location.</p>

<p>Any who have looked upon the Lady are now blind, their skin the rough consistency of rock. They are not statues, not completely, but enough of their insides are made into stone so that what remains of their lives is agony. Yet all consider themselves blessed, having claimed to seen the very definition of both Beauty and Truth.</p>

<p>Instead of being mazed, those who do not displease the Lady to warrant such punishment are instead left on miniature islands, adrift in a mysterious ocean whose fruit sustains all forms of life.</p>

<p>The Inner Planes are Positive, Negative, the Ethereal, The Mists of Water and Air,  the Burning Caverns of Earth and Fire, and the Twilight Savannah of Darkness and Light.</p>

<p>There are seven Outer Planes, which are as follows:</p>

<p>Heaven: The Plane of Mercy and Justice, Heaven is dominated by a great mountain that slopes downward in a gentle curve, ultimately becoming the rest of the land. At the top of the mountain, from which the entire plane radiates, is a shining pin point of light. It is this silver orb that provides the majority of illumination in this plane's eternal night. The stars are far too distant, and far too few.</p>

<p>Heaven is overseen by the lycanthrope celestials who both mete out justice across the Multiverse but also raise and protect Heaven-born mortals and arriving petitioners as if they were the archons' cubs.</p>

<p>Heart Wild: The Plane of Freedom and Passion, the Heart Wild is a forest that shifts without warning from temperate pines to sweltering jungle to a land of dead, sun bleached trees. The weather above is even more inconstant, often subject to the whims of the mortai.</p>

<p>The Heart Wild is guarded by a variety of beings including eladrin, oreads, valkyries, and sphinxes. It is commonly accepted that the wisdom of the ratatosks is the ultimate arbiter when conflict arises.</p>

<p>The Iron Desert: The Plane of Tyranny and Control. A vast plain of metal that ends up with rust covering its surface in compex, and as yet indecipherable, calligraphy. Upon it the Riaa conduct their endless slave trade. The Riaa are a race of lawful evil fiends that are some born from the patterns of rust that long to complete themselves. They are gangly, emaciated beings whose black metal bones are clearly present under the thin cover of translucent white flesh that stretches over their forms.</p>

<p>The Riaa are constantly at war with each other, but it is a war rarely of violence and more often of politics and riddle contests. In fact, Riaa flat out refuse to kill one another, so instead most conflicts consist of capturing and attempting to brainwash the enemy. Given the untold eons they've had to practice on each other, they easily create armies of broken souls to fight their battles for them.</p>

<p>The Shattered Mountains: The Plane of Excess and Madness. A mountain range of broken stone under an angry red sun, the air filled with chastising insects, the Shattered Mountains continually shift their paths and threaten travelers with avalanches and earthquakes. </p>

<p>The stone, or at times crystal, takes on varied hues and consistencies and often is covered over by poisonous moss,strangling vines, or sentient mold. Caverns and hidden valleys lead to sybarite kingdoms of the varrangoin, sibriex flesh crafters, and bebilith hive minds, each using its will to create a nightmare realm to sate its own alien pleasures.</p>

<p>The Ink Wells: The Plane of Creativity and Transformation, the Ink Wells are pools of various shapes and sizes, each holding a swirl of variegated ink. Fey and Slaad race around the pools, using the ink of various materials, including their own flesh, to alter their persons or bring fictional beings to life. The ink is said to be the petitioners who come here, conjoining their personalities into a wondrous whirlwind of insane imagination.</p>

<p>Many artists come here as well, forming protective communities in order to utilize the ink in more controlled fashions. They are aided by the monastic, unified races of Gith, who help ensure the underlying, foundational reality of the Ink Wells is not overwritten by the wildness of its more chaotic inhabitants. Note that despite the high body count there is no malice in the conflict between the races of Gith and the children of either Titania or Renbuu.</p>

<p>To dive into the ink wells is to throw the dice regarding identity, location, and perhaps even one's place on the timeline.</p>

<p>The Web (Inspired by China Mieville): A weaving of energy touching all creation, a fractal plane that ever revises its patterns in unpredictable fashions, the Web is also known as the Threads of Synchronicity and Indra's Net. No one knows who set the spidery constructs that oversee this place their duties, nor does anyone understand how these arachnids use the Web to traverse both space and time, mysteriously pushing this Wheel toward Order or Chaos as it suits them.</p>

<p>The Ocean of Blood: It is said that the exemplars of a primordial age had their veins opened here, and that they lie at the bottom of what most sages agree is a depthless body of liquid.</p>

<p>The mysterious Rilmani forever patrol this plane in their boats, using lanterns to guide them through the red mist. While their motivations are unknown, and supposedly tied to the concept of Balance, one cannot help but note the mercy they show in rescuing those who are stranded, drowning, or beset by the monstrous yet natural reptilian, amphibious, and ichthyian vampiric horrors of this plane. </p>

<p>Somewhere, it is said, the waters turn from red to cleansed cerulean, and one can land upon the beach that leads to the secrets of Sigil.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

As on many of the lawful planes, constructs have found great favor with the deities here.

<p>Admittedly I have a lot of catching up to do on this magnificent thread, but I just had to interject quickly here to express my absolute joy and amazement that you just worked Voltron into a Planescape thread.</div></p>

<p>This made my day - thanks! I'll admit I was rather proud of that bit.</p>

         <p>Parallel XLV: Blessed are the Liminal Messiahs</p>

<p><em>Credit to Jem, who introduced me to the idea of and potential of the Liminal. Dragon empire credit to Robin Hobb.</em></p>

<p>"We should leave..."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Jacen, get off your knees and look outside the thrice-damned window! There's an army of demodands and yugoloths marching toward this city. We should leave here, leave Carceri entirely."</p>

<p>"I'm not leaving. I told you, I saw the Truth out there. You go if you want, I couldn't leave if I tried and you can't run forever." </p>

<p>"Jacen -"</p>

<p>"Faith roots me to this red lit soil that casts my shadow upon the clouds. It knows I've submitted. It knows I wait for It here."</p>

<p>=-=-=</p>

<p>Multiverse Forty-Five, until the turn of its last quarter century, was similar in many ways to Multiverse Prime with not quite minor differences but no radical shift from the Prime's planar configuration. </p>

<p>Differences? Orcus never became Thanatos but he neither was he slain, Vecna remains an immortal lich king on Oerth, the Expansionists and Incantifiers never ticked off the Lady and are still around.</p>

<p>Other differences...hmmm....oh, that whole weird thing with Chaos hatching out of an egg on Krynn? That never happened....You sure Chourst didn't have something to do with that on Multiverse Prime? Rather...random, that....</p>

<p>Anyway - Twenty-five years ago, something appeared in the midst of the Blood War, upon the Field of Nettles. At first it seemed like the Indigo Death Mother dancing, then a fiend that was either an enriynes or a succubus...then the fiends blinked as lightning momentarily blinded even their generals and it was clearly a miscegenation of a pit fiend and a gorristo, then a Kyton and a Marillith, then an ice-devil sweating rain on account of its burning balor head. </p>

<p>Neither tanar'ri nor baatezu attacked. Seven ultroloths appeared, surrounding the shifting creature, their thoughts stabbing at the meat housed it is iconoclast skull. Thought it wept black ichor and even coughed out its innards, in the circumference of their circle it became a towering baernoloth with three heads, each bearing a different face of the demodand castes. Every finger was the length of one of their blank canvas faces.</p>

<p>The ultroloths know they didn't blink, know their iridescent opal eyes never turned from the one they had come to pass judgement on. It walked through them, and as it walked it seemed to become amorphous shadow, a tyrannical darkness that bore an abstract resemblance to a bebilith. </p>

<p>When it changed again, into a humble hordling quasit, the battle field somehow grew a brighter shade of grey yet everyone on the field knew that luminescence had been lost. Perhaps devoured.</p>

<p>The one it passed through was now blind, now named The First. It shared its last sight with the other six, and the shifting figure had its first seven disciples. They left the field of battle, not in a flash of space-twisting arcana or even inches above the soaked grey soil that hungered for color and anger alike.</p>

<p>The ultroloths walked. The baatezu and tanar'ri parted, though the nycaloths and arcanaloths refused to be so easily cowed.</p>

<p>Their statues still sit upon the battlefield turned fiend-sacred ground, the footsteps of the Seven walking around them undisturbed despite the billions of fiendish visitors.</p>

<p>=-=-=</p>

<p>Water that offers light and warmth, air that is cut into blocks and hammered into swords, clouds of gemstone that can be breathed in, fire that when set upon the soil causes the crops to grow.</p>

<p>=-=-=</p>

<p>The red-gold dragon is the brilliance of the setting sun, and the metallic and chromatic dragons listen to its sermons whether they are given upon tundras, in the depths of the swamps, or the highest mountain reaches. They fly across the world, or even between worlds, at first as spectators then later as genuine witnesses.</p>

<p>Later, a black-silver wyrm offers the same salvation on an Alternate Prime.</p>

<p>Twenty years ago, almost all the chromatic and metallic dragons across all the Primes of this Wheel vanished. When they returned, they seemed more at peace, their faces the very definition of serenity as they explained to the lesser races across the Rainbow Oceans that they would be assuming control of the crystal spheres.</p>

<p>This war is being fought today, though there has been no siting of the liminal dragon. None but the dragons know the contents of its scriptures, none but they know the purpose of these draconic empires.</p>

<p>=-=-=</p>

<p>Sigil remains the City of Doors. The Lady of Pain flays anyone who speaks aloud about the Lords of the Boundaries, but curiously enough does nothing to those who put speak their thoughts through ink and paper, chisel and stone, or mind to mind. </p>

<p>Only those who allow breath to become voice face the sentence in Her shadow.</p>

<p>There is something else in the air, an all pervading feeling that one's long lost siblings, lovers, or perhaps it is enemies have finally returned.</p>

<p>In the midst of the Second Unhuman Wars, the seed of a child is formed in the folds of a flower, a wet fetal thing tumbling out of the cusp of a tulip, plopping into the water garden of one Elven Admiral Elana.</p>

<p>Believing it to be a blessing from the Tel'Seldarine, Elana nurtures the embyro, turning the attention of its bio-mages away from the creation of more Spirit Warriors and towards the gestation of the miracle.</p>

<p>Then, before it is fully developed, it is both clear that it is a boy and that it bears features that are both elven and goblinoid.</p>

<p>Clerics and conjurers, alchemists and druids, all are brought in to study the child while chronomancers work around the clock to freeze its development. They are barely managing to keep it from maturing any further.</p>

<p>Though elven worlds are reporting droughts, locusts, rivers and rains of blood, still the Elven Armada is under strict orders not to allow the completion of the fetus to term.</p>

<p>They do not know the druids plan to betray them and take the child to their co-conspirators amongst the orcish shamans.<br />

<p>No Liminal Messiah has visited the Celestials. Instead, they have united on their own in order to prepare for the advancement of a unified Lower Planes. Thankfully, the prejudices of the Nine, the Baern, and many Abyssal Lords has prevented this from coming to fruition.</p>

<p>All the balaena have retreated from affairs beyond their river domain, and no longer aid travelers unless they witness them under attack by intruders or they are drowning. Many planewalkers claim they have seen shadows of the celestial whales in the murkiest depths of the Oceanus. They are, apparently, singing lieder of celebration whose watery echoes are dirges of mourning...or perhaps it is the other way around.<br />

<p>Have you seen the Silver Monk? Hairless, voluptuous, compassionate, stern - her flesh is the Philosopher's Stone. She is Ether and Astral, Matter and Mind, and she offers Enlightenment if we are willing to serve her to the end of our days.</p>

<p>She will save us from the dragons. I know She will. But first we must find a boy being kept apart from his predestined birth.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Parallel XLVI: The Dreamers' Exchange</p>

<p><em>"I'm with you in Rockland - in my dreams you walk dripping from a sea-journey on the highway across America in tears to the door of my cottage in the Western night."
 -Ginsberg, Howl</p>

<p>Marie is afraid to fall asleep, despite the fact that her restraints feel secure. She can see the black soot stains upon the charred stone, she knows that sometimes Hell can sweat through her pores.</p>

<p>The men and women gathered around the pentacle that circumscribes her seem cautious but rather than overly worried you might characterize their leering as overly eager. They stand with ledgers in hand, ready to record Bel's thoughts and observations.</p>

<p>One of them, Marie is sure it is someone different every time, says something in words that are achingly familiar and yet utterly foreign.</p>

<p>Marie yawns and with a haze dulling the edges of her fears quickly tumbles into slumber. The smile on that sleeping face stretches out until lips bleed, showing the folly of a human trying to mimic the wicked grin of a pitfiend, especially one who has earned a place among the Nine.<br />
</em><br />
=-=-=</p>

<p>Parallel Forty-Six is another parallel that bears an incredibly strong resemblance to Multiverse Prime, though here the Astral is an argent ocean lapping at the Outer Planes on one end and the Plane of Dreams at the other.</p>

<p>The Plane of Dreams is at once capricious and constant, a land of subjective environments based on individual dreamers as well as the foundational home of those archetypal forces that unite all aspects of creation. It the nature of this place to act as a sieve to subjective experience, revealing meaning in dreams by referencing events and symbols easily looked up in any planar's Dream Dictionary.</p>

<p>Portals attempting to connect the Inner and Prime Material Planes to the Outer Planes almost inevitably collapse, oftentimes in catastrophic or at least chaotic ways. These portals, if they can be salvaged at all, from then on lead to the Plane of Dreams rather than their intended destinations. It doesn't matter if the portal is constantly open, occasionally used, or a never used escape plan. The very magic attempting to link the Outer and Inner Planes is ultimately made wild by the Plane of Dreams. </p>

<p>Anyone attempting to make such a portal should be ready to account for dangerous, miles-wide wild surges.</p>

<p>Sailing the Astral Ocean from the shores of Dream is a safer method to get to the Outer, but time on the silvery waters is at best stretched and shortened unexpectedly and at worst violently nonlinear. There is also the danger of astral dragons, streaker flocks, and the terrifying Astral Dreadnought. (Whether there is more than one of these on this Wheel is as unclear as it is on Prime, if not more so.)</p>

<p>The most common means to make contact between extraplanars and innerplanars (including primes) is through dreams. However, there is an extreme difference between common and reliable - there seems little rhyme or reason why some beings on different sides of the Astral Ocean would end up dreaming each others' lives. Even more dangerous, at times the dreamer becomes a planar vortex themselves, channeling the plane in their dream onto the one in which they are physically present.</p>

<p>Perhaps the answer lies in the clockwork steam city of Sigil, where it is believed the dabus-tended machines upon and under the streets of the Cage set up the exchange of dreams. The entire shining, colorful, razor-vine free, and <em>clean</em> city supposedly manipulates dreams at the behest of a mysterious Lady no one alive (or un-alive) can claim to have encountered.</p>

<p>Why then, you ask, does anyone believe in the Lady? Because she visits us in our dreams. Sometimes it is only one person, sometimes whole nations all at once dream that they are kneeling in worship before the Lady of Pain, their sins shriven by the scalpels of Her shadow.</p>

<p>Whether or not the Lady is real, the machines of Sigil have no known purpose. They are regarded as important because though those who try to ruin them or get in the way of the dabus end up as sleepwalkers destined for eternal slumber. Those looking into the minds of the sleepers describe the dream of a Labyrinth to which all enemies of the Lady are confined.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Your Multiverse 45 had some elements that reminded me of a homebrew campaign I ran, so I guess I'll throw that in here.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Parallel XLVII:  The Evolution of Evil</span></p>

<p>-<span style="font-style:italic">Excerpt from the journals of Decirius Bael, noted fiend historian, now missing for 6 years:</span></p>

<p>For two races that regard each other with such murderous intent, the devils and demons (Baatezu and Tanar'ri to be more precise), sure do share an awful lot of similarities - just be sure never to mention this in their presence unless you are willing to face their wrath.  While looking at the two races from a military historian's perspective, I began compiling notes on their separate caste systems and noticed some startling parallels.  </p>

<p>Both races have "familiar" creatures - sent out to the prime plane to tempt and weaken mortal spellcasters (Imp vs Quasit).  Both have endless legions of mindless soldiers to act as cannon fodder (Lemure/Nupperibo vs Manes/Dretch).  Each side has their elite "shock troop" soldiers (Barbazu vs Bulezau).  For heavy cavalry the devils use their hellish Narzugon, and the demons counter with an Armanite charge.  Arial support consists of the Abishai vs the Vrock.  Each side has very capable unit leaders/lieutenants - the Cornugons for the Baatezu and the Hezrou for the Tanar'ri.  Both races boast clever tacticians or information holders - the Amnizu and Gelugons on one side, opposed by the Marilith and Glabrezu on the other.  The Osyluth handles internal affairs and recruitment for the devils, while the demons rely on the Chasme, Babau, or Molydeus to fill this niche.  Each side has a specialist in seduction and espionage - the Erinyes and the Succubus.  Lastly, both forces have nearly all powerful generals to lead their terrible hosts - the Pit Fiend commands the infernal armies, while the Balor rallies the abyssal hordes.</p>

<p>The careful observer will note the devils and demons have disturbing similarities, despite the tanar'ri's propensity towards chaos and mutation.  This is no coincedence.  It is because every devil has a personal demon counterpart.  In fact they are flip sides of the same being!  Perhaps this is one of their many sources of discontent and bloodlust.  Every fiend feels "incomplete" and is driven by an illogical hatred to annihilate the opposite race.  This is not to say if the races were ever merged or integrated to their true forms they will lose an ounce of malice or spite.  It is interesting to note that a fiend's <span style="font-style:italic">true name</span> can give a hint as to its counterpart on the other side.  It is said that a Tanar'ri <span style="font-style:italic">true name</span> is simply a corruption of the name of his Baatezu mirror.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Note:  it is generally believed there are far more demons than devils in existence, thereby casting a dubious shadow on the counterpart theory.  However, this is chalked up to the many peculiar vagaries of the multiverse.  Perhaps not all the demons are "true" fiends, and these dregs will eventually wither out and die during this</span> "Evilution" <span style="font-style:italic">process.</span></p>

<p>                  -end of final journal entry</p>

<p>*<br />
*</p>

<p>Decirius went missing because he stumbled onto a truth he was never meant to realize.  For millenia the yugoloths have manipulated the devils and demons into fighting each other in a brutal, plane-spanning Blood War.  As one side seems to gain an upper hand, there you will find a group of 'loths undercutting and sabotaging.  And in the other camp you will no doubt find more 'loths supplying conscripts and hideously powerful weapons to help turn the tide.  The reason for the perpetuation of the most violent conflict ever known is simple on the surface: pure greed.  The yugoloth's official stance is they are simply a lower planar race of traders, merchants, and mercenaries.  The label of "fiend' is decidedly unfair, as they are only trying to make a comfortable living - just as every other sentient being in the multiverse does.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for everyone that is not a Yugoloth, the truth is much more sinister.  The 'loths have in fact been steering the course of the centuries-long Blood War as a means of battle training.  For only in the heat of combat does one innovate the greatest advances in tactics, instincts, and weaponry.  The Celestials of the Upper Planes train hard to be sure, and while their skills are formidable, they are child's play compared to the utter brutality and violence unleashed by the fiends against each other on a daily basis.</p>

<p>The enigmatic leaders of the yugoloth race have decided the baatezu and tanar'ri have warred with each other long enough.  Their skills have been honed to a razor-edge, and now the time has come to unleash what they have learned against the upper planes.  Once the celestials are wiped out, the rest of creation will fall like wheat before the scythe.  And so the 'loths have begun their master plan to merge the devils and demons into one super-powerful race of True Fiends - the ultimate battle-hardened warriors.</p>

<p>Ages ago, deep in the endless deserts of the Gray Waste, the Yugoloths unearthed an artifact of incalculable power: The Heart of Darkness.  In the <span style="text-decoration:underline">Book of Derelict Magicks</span> it is theorized that <span style="font-style:italic">"one ultroloth created a gem which it used to "purify" the yugoloths.  This magnificent jewel spilled the law and chaos into forms of the larvae nearby, which were then herded to the Abyss and Baator, where they evolved into the baatezu and tanar'ri."</span></p>

<p>						- from <span style="text-decoration:underline">Faces of Evil</span></p>

<p>Now, untold centuries after the split, with the devils and demons having perfected the art of war, the yugoloths wish to use the power of the Heart of Darkness to pull the two separate races back to their original daemonic forms.  Fortunately for all, the yugoloths are not able to wield the Heart of Darkness to this end.  Either the technique of the original ultroloth has been forgotten, or the artifact is simply not able to undo what it did those long years ago.  Whatever the case may be, the 'loths have surmised the only way to complete their plan is to destroy the Heart.  Ultroloth overlords have theorized that if the gem is smashed, the original "purification" spell will be broken and each devil/demon counterpart will be forcefully integrated.  However, every spell of weakening or sundering, every weapon or force of nature that has been brought to bear upon the Heart simply slides off it like water.  </p>

<p>Except in Parallel 47....</p>

<p>Here, through a series of circumstances likely never again to be duplicated, the yugoloths successfully smashed the Heart of Darkness - thus setting the <span style="font-style:italic">Evilution</span> in place.  On battlefields all across the lower planes, infernal and abyssal forces feel an irresistable pull towards one another, so strong it even overrides their ages-old racial enmity.  Fiends of like "type" (see unit comparisons above) find themselves merging together into uber-fiends - creatures several times stronger than the sum of their parts.  Gelugons and Mariliths combine into a horrid insectile/reptillian nightmares, while Cornugons and Hezrou meld into brutes that resemble giant slaadi, only covered head to toe in razor sharp bony spikes and ridges.  Worst by far though are the nigh-omnipotent <span style="font-style:italic">Balrogs</span> - the terrifying union of a Pit Fiend and a Balor.</p>

<p>Parallel 47 is lost.  It is a forgone conclusion that this mighty host of True Fiends - who have no compunction against using the precepts of law or chaos (having seen the strengths and weaknesses of both over the centuries) - will swallow up all of existence, with the various angelic armies offering whatever meager resistance they can.  Our only hope is that these beings are somehow unable to traverse the parallels, and that this particular turn of events cannot be duplicated elsewhere.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>sciborg2</em> wrote:</div>Personally I'd definitely post them here and let us play - for me at least this thread was always meant to be an informal one that shapes itself to the interests at hand.</div></p>

<p>Fantastic - I'll probably post a few things before the day is up, but here's the introduction:</p>

<p><strong>Parallel IIL: </strong>(intro/draft)</p>

<p>Sigil is a city of bunkers and towers, cast in scarred and scorched black iron. With little upkeep to do, the fearsome draconic dabus monitor the city from their high-up perches, glumly carrying out their absent Lady's final order. The impression is of a city under siege, with visitors and residents alike spending no longer in public spaces than it takes to do their business. Only the Clueless linger.</p>

<p>Wheelwalkers are uniformly taken aback by the shrines to the Lady of Pain, though locals will quickly point out that she deserves the reverence and is frankly in no position to do anything about it. Even on the planes, it is a rare municipal official that has closed a gate to the Far Realms from the wrong side.</p>

<p>Centuries later, pilgrims still deliver flowers and trinkets to the spot where the Lady sacrificed herself, an entire city block of charred, black earth. It was mid-afternoon when the portal opened - exemplars and urchins alike stood by slack-jawed as buildings suddenly tumbled into the darkness. All was quiet for a moment, before their surprise turned to horror at what emerged. This was a parallel with no Vast Gate, no Blood Queen - while being remarkably similar to the Multiverse Prime, it had been blessedly untouched by the Far Realms. Not even the most sagacious celestial or fiend had precedent for the monstrosities that emerged.</p>

<p>The Lady was lost early in the ensuing battle. Accounts tell of her acting with no hesitation, arriving at the scene of the calamity and immediately descending towards the dark pit, meeting its geyzer of monsters in an explosion of alien gore. She disappeared into the portal and moments later it simply vanished. This and other stories of the Battle of Sigil have brought a tear to the eye of many a hardened wheelwalker - proxies of warring powers standing back-to-back against a sea of gibbering aberrations, a trio of shining angels luring a tentacled horror into a waiting mob of ferocious devils, the gentle dabus transforming into death-dealing creatures of the sky.</p>

<p>Unfortunately it was many hours into the fighting when the Guvners realized that the creatures may have been the least of their problems. A shimmering, noxious fog had also come from the portal. That it was transforming any being it encountered into an insane, misshaped beast was bad enough - now it was drifting unimpeded through the city's portals, to hundreds of locations across the multiverse. Mages were able to corral what remained of it as the warriors butchered the last of the invaders, but both were pathetically small victories. Half of the city was leveled and thousands were dead, with the damage across the planes yet to be measured.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><strong>Parallel IIL</strong> - the idea grab bag:</p>

<p>Originally I was imagining many aberrations escaping Sigil for the planes, though they all seem to have turned out dead. This may change. The mist could wreak terrible havoc in some places (turning entire prime worlds into cannibalized wastelands) but less so in others. Centuries and generations later, perhaps the "realm-touched" are a sizable demographic in various societies.</p>

<p>Terrorism is a fact of life in Sigil, from cultists and assorted aberrational crazies (most intent on reopening the portal, naturally). Thus the iron architecture and the dragon dabus (the latter being one of the Lady's incapacitation contingencies...).</p>

<p>The elemental planes have been thoroughly infected (or conquered), though they remain as elemental as before. Splitting the difference, I suppose. Maybe I just want giant gasbag creatures all over the Plane of Air. Probably. </p>

<p>Traveling the Styx is basically a death wish considering what's living in there now. This has thrown a large wrench in a great deal of lower planar commerce.</p>

<p>Spots of weird, alien beauty exist across the upper planes. </p>

<p>Some races no longer exist in their natural forms.</p>

<p>I haven't even considered how the powers are with all of this.</p>

<p>edited to add: I'm trying to keep in mind that this is a world with no experience with the Far Realms before this incident or since, which seems interesting. I suppose this is where it makes a genuine difference if any invaders actually survived or not.</p>

<p>edited once more: thinking about Monte Cook's Chaositech and how an incident such as this one might instigate a boom in novel and heretofore unavailable magic-tech of some kind.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Parallel XLIX: The Luminous Deluge</p>

<p>"I'm not a baby, I'm a tumor."<br />
  -Hellboy II</p>

<p>Parallel 48 is awash with energies from the Positive Material Plane. The Bastion of Unborn Souls expands across the infinite golden blaze of Life, producing such an excess souls that many - too many - are housed in too few bodies. The madness of Demogorgon is now common occurrence.</p>

<p>Mutations occur constantly and randomly, crustaceans born from burrowing insects bursting out of the bellies of ancient dragons, fungi that sicken whole forests exploding into spore clouds that block nations from the sun while producing a rain of mycanoid giants.</p>

<p>Swarms of Ragnorra type Elder Evils devastate the crystal spheres of the Prime Material and its varied alternates, bringing about twisted life even as all the worlds see a rise in fecundity to such an extent that deserts become jungles of choking disease laden humidity.</p>

<p>Elemental energies across the Multiverse shift toward their positive quasielemental aspects. A single candle can flare with the light of a sun, blinding an entire continent. Storms deliver enough lightning to pound mountains to rubble even as oceans evaporate into steam. Once fertile soil hardens and pales into lifeless diamonds and gold.</p>

<p>Most undead are eradicated, those with the means have traveled to the Negative Material Plane which in turn has led to a massive influx, over the years, in the numbers of undead Dustmen and Doomguard.</p>

<p>In the midst of this madness Siva has become savior, protecting the worlds in which he is worshiped by placing necromantic moons in the sky to balance the overflow of Positive energy. (Each moon is an Atropus type being guarded by Atropals)</p>

<p>Siva's intervention has allowed the mages and scholars of billions of worlds to work together to answer the ultimate question: What has caused Life itself to run amok in this Multiverse?</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Thoughts on Parallel 48, the Far Realms Freestyle</p>

<p>I really like how the Lady closed the gate from the other side. I wonder if She is now Otiax, the strange vestige connected to the Far Realms in some mysterious way. (I present Otiax as working with those Far Realm beings that want to keep our realities apart because we can be just as poisonous to them.)</p>

<p>Since vestiges likely exist outside linear time, she became Otiax and existed as both the vestige and her blade-haired self before the Far Realm invasion.</p>

<p>I like the idea of alien beauty you mention, glowing honeysuckles that hum transcendent music kind of beauty. The Far Realm is usually sort of boring to me, lots of cysts and octopuses with some insect thrown in. The Far Realm should bring about all kinds of weird, transplanar beauty as well. The flora and fauna from the movie Avatar could fit as Far Realm touched Nature as could other depictions of life in SF.</p>

<p>In fact to have this alien, but possibly non-fatal spillover from the Far Realms could turn Spelljammer into a much more Science-fiction leaning game than it was before.</p>

<p>One could also play out scenarios like those from Solaris, or make it lean to Zerg + Event Horizon + Crysis. Be cool to bring in Monte's Chaositech stuff.</p>

<p>Don't know how many people read Mieville's latest offering Embassy Town, but the alien species known as the Host could be less hostile creatures coming out of the Far Realms or evolving from the touch of the fog.</p>

<p>I think many of the gods would be incredibly disturbed by the transformations of the Multiverse, and might utilize their powers to create safe areas or even safe-worlds for their followers. Of course this creates conditions similar to the black plague, where you have to eliminate those approaching just in case they are infected.</p>

<p>Many of the gods of nature are either diminished or dying, and in their place arise new deities as well as new druids who represent the newer, less sane, natural order.</p>

<p>On the Plane of Shadows there is now great opportunity for some Lovecraftian Noir.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Parallel LI: His Death Throes Echo in the Caverns of our Skulls</p>

<p>The Cataclysm of Parallel 51 (50 is the Shadowverse, which was the duplicate 27):</p>

<p>In this Multiverse, Gith was a little kinder and perhaps Zerthimon a little less wise. Their people still separated but it was more amicable, each promising to keep peace with the other. And so the githzerai settled upon Limbo, the place where reality is shaped with a thought. Their brothers and sisters, the githyanki, settled upon the Astral, the place of Thought itself.</p>

<p>One day, the monasteries of the githzerai wove themselves together in the seas of primordial chaos, shaping themselves into some greater structure. On that same day, the githyanki projected the energies of the Astral through the crystalline tangle of now interconnected houses of meditation. Argent mirror-toned light moved through initiations of refraction and reflection, raising the meta-monastery through levels of thought, awakening the chakras of its being.</p>

<p>Silver light shot back through the Astral, burning lines of light blazing through pools colored in the brown shades of soil. Arrows of illumination all piercing the Caverns of Thought, all of them conjoining in the assassination of the mind flayer God.</p>

<p>Ilsensine screamed without voice, and sanity across this Multiverse was butchered.</p>

<p>=-=-=</p>

<p>Status Quo on Parallel 51:</p>

<p>Ilsensine is still screaming. The sane and nearly so speculate he might take forever to die.</p>

<p>Alignment is a nebulous thing. Disorders and delusions can turn raging pyromaniacs who have no regard for life into supposed messiahs attempting to teach love to lions and tigers and bears.</p>

<p>Cultists open portals to fiends who are too busy dealing with their compulsive disorders involving the counting of grains of sand to wreak havoc on the Prime.</p>

<p>Elementals think they are human children, human children think they are plants. Plants think they eat meat, which leads to ambulatory sentient flora wasting away even as they feast on the flesh of their farmer neighbors. Their madness keeps them from absorbing nutrients from sunlight and they refuse to draw nutrients from the soil due to their denial.</p>

<p>Vampires and ghouls suffer eating disorders. Beholders become so paranoid their eye stalks always face in different directions. Merfolk become terrified of drowning and drow develop arachnophobia.</p>

<p>Ssendam is so strong all of Limbo shines with her golden light. The slaad lord seems content with the security granted by her burgeoning power, and has seen fit to use her power once - this is why Ygorl has been reincarnated as a mortal in possession of but also unaware of his powers as the Lord of Entropy. Ygorl's mount is searching for him across this Wheel.</p>

<p>In Sigil, even some dabus babble in lunatic rebuses and the Lady finds Herself culling them from the herd...<br />
=-=-=<br />
Notes:</p>

<p>Undead eating disorders inspired by stuff on Ravenloft forum Cafe De Nuit. Merfolk terrified of water is from Tower of Babel, a JLA comic story.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>I feel a bit the same about it. Maybe that's the hazard of having such a sophisticated, thoughtfully-created setting (as we were discussing in the other thread) - by comparison this unknownable realm of madness is just kind of dull. Xoriat seems a bit more interesting to me, but not terribly much so. All that said, I was trying to think of something completely horrific to befall Sigil and why not? Far Realms reboot!</p>

<p>Thank you for the feedback - some great suggestions in there. I'm going to let them percolate and will surely have more thoughts soon.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>That's the one - thanks!</p>

<p>Thinking more about Far Realms Freestyle, it is rife with possibilities and in fact inspired my idea of having Positive Material infect everything. A lot of that would be horrific, but the increase in quasi-elemental beings might allow for some beautiful yet still hostile places.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Parallel LII: That's Why the Lady is a Swan</p>

<p>"Do I know what a swan looks like? Are you serious? It was a giant, colorful swan. A phoenix swan. Am I painting a picture for you here? Stop making that face and just take my word for it. The Lady of Pain was a phoenix swan. I'm not sure what's so complicated about this.</p>

<p>Listen, did you hire me to find the Harvester or was I secretly supposed to be plying the Lady of Pain with stale bread the whole time? Can we move on? Thank you.</p>

<p>It's a remarkably tough place to get around, for how simple it is. Sigil isn't so much a city of portals as a fickle and undependable transit system - it floats through the Inner Planes on a cloud and when it's drifted somewhere that you'd like to go, you get off. There are rope ladders and helpful leprechauns. It's very charming. So that can take some time and is frankly the least of it. There are four Inner Planes, but talking about them individually is kind of pointless for reasons that should become clear. </p>

<p>The gnomes told us that the Harvester was on the Plane of Summer and off we went. The Plane of Summer moves in and out of phase with the Plane of Moon and the Plane of Sun, which means two things: first, it's either midnight or noon. Those are your options. Second, when two planes are in phase they actually coexist at the same time. I cannot emphasize the mind-boggleness of this, and even the natives screw it up once in a while. </p>

<p>Case in point: It was nighttime (aka Moon) on Summer when we departed Sigil. Phases sometimes last hours, sometimes months - there's allegedly some kind of pattern to it, but I remain unconvinced. We traveled for several days across rolling hills and through luminescent forests. It was lovely. A flock of Summer Dragons flying in front of the moon is one of the most breathtaking things I've seen in all of the planes. We rested in an Elven Summer village and a domed Dwarven Moon city and even the dwarves were cheerful and hospitable. Don't worry, I'm almost done with the saccharine bits. Several hours after leaving the dwarves, everything began to shimmer - the planes were changing phase at last. My halfling guides warned me to avert my eyes, as the Moon to Sun transition could be understandably jarring. But apparently they'd forgotten to carry a one in their calculations or some such thing, as we hadn't been tied to the Plane of Summer at all. We'd been tied to the Plane of the Moon, which was now in phase with the brutal Plane of Winter and for which we were basically completed unprepared. We doubled back to the dwarf city, fighting against the bitter wind and stumbling in the darkness over treacherous patches of ice. The great glowing dome was just in sight when the wind turned to a blizzard, apparently to announce the arrival of a shaggy hulk who introduced himself as Turaq the Devourer; the dwarves later explained that Turaq is one of the Lords of Winter and is encountered only very rarely, as he is usually in the mountains plotting against Shamstamp the Moon Bear. Wherever their afterlife is, I hope that the halfings can take some comfort that they were not eaten by a snow monster - they were eaten by an elusive local celebrity.</p>

<p>By the time I'd woken up from a much needed rest, it was Summer again. The halflings had been quarreling about our actual destination in a tongue I didn't quite recognize, so getting directions from the helpful dwarves was a bit complicated. After my fifth or sixth attempt at wrapping my mouth around the strange syllables my hosts began discussing amongst themselves what in the world I might be talking about. Someone mentioned duruch'i-lin and that was all I needed to hear. This was the Harvester of Horses, after all. I headed to the west, where I would find the Realm of The Hoof King and his Court of Great Unicorns."</p> <div class="dice_rolls">
