      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>The laws of physics themselves may also be drastically different from Prime to Prime and from one plane to another.  (I seem to vaguely recall that Oerth is one world where smoke powder literally doesn't work; is this correct?)  The local laws of physics may literally not allow for the invention of firearms, much less electronics.  </p>

<p>There are also cultural factors that may prevent the invention/widespread use of technologies.  For example, even some of the ancient Greeks understood some principles of both automation and steam power!  However, many ancient societies, including ancient Greece, had a means other than technology to get stuff done:  a hot and cold running supply of slave labor.  Why build an expensive contraption to do something when you could buy slaves cheaply at the local market to do the same thing?  A typical fantasy society has access to magic, lots and lots of it, to get things done.  Someone wanting to do some project would likely just hire a mage or research a new spell rather than trying to build a new magic-less invention.</p>

<p>I believe that some ancient Earth societies also didn't really see the need to mass-produce a new technological marvel or put it into general, widespread use.  A new technology was something to put into a temple (to honor the Gods and impress visitors to temples?) or a curiosity, maybe something to impress one's peers, but not something really designed to make people's lives easier or to be used routinely by the 'masses'/lower classes.  Large-scale industrial production assumes a certain cultural mindset.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Yes, but it has nothing to do with a change to the laws of physics.  The gods literally force smokepowder and gunpowder to not function within the crystal sphere, but only those two specific substances and other replacements that could be used in their place in firearms.  Those that worship Murlynd are an exception.  And other similar devices, like the laser guns captured from the spaceship wreckage in the Barrier Peaks, work just fine.</p>

<p>Still, there are crystal spheres like Truespace where the laws of physics <span style="font-style:italic">are</span> different, so your point does still hold.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><span style="font-style:italic">I think the reason planars dismiss all those Primes is that they can't wrap their head around the size, or the sheer numbers. Sigil, now, Sigil is an ambition a planar can handle. You can be somebody in this fishbowl. But you can't be a big someone on every one of those Primes, so you tell yourself that none of them are important.</span></p>

<p>No, the point of their arrogance is that they are doing things that affect every prime world, rather than just affecting a single Prime world directly.  Also, the PS canon is quite clear that Sigil, the City of Brass, and many other planar metropolises are far larger than anything on any prime world.  Oerth and Toril of course have far greater total populations than Sigil or the City of Brass, nobody will dispute that.  However, those worlds are not unified into a single tribe or civilization.<br />
This same arrogance can be found outside of Sigil, too.  In my works, Cryonax holds a condescending view of Auril (who likewise views him as insignificant).  Cryonax views her as a fool for focusing on freezing a single measly prime world in a single crystal sphere when she could try freezing the inner planes, which will thus freeze the entire multiverse (thus, why try to freeze one prime when you can go to the source and freeze them all?)</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Not far larger, no.  Sigil has a population of around 350,000.  Waterdeep has around 130,000 people, and the Greyhawk metropolitan area has around 160,000 people, with the city itself having around 70,000.  Since you're a northwesterner too, comparatively you're talking about comparing Portland to Boise, basically.</p>

<p>Also, be honest, Hyena; when was the last time in-canon that a Planescape event affected goings-on in Toril, Oerth, Krynn...any Prime world, really?  It's far more the opposite, in fact.  Look at, for example, how the events of Apocalypse Stone completely ruined Moloch's work in Baator.  From a meta-view, it's because as a meta setting Planescape would be far more likely to incorporate the events of other settings than other settings were to incorporate the events of Planescape (same as with Ravenloft of Spelljammer), but in-setting I can't remember any Greyhawk, Forgotten Realms, or Dragonlance products mentioning fallout from events in a Planescape product.  The closest is probably that Infinite Staircase crossover Realms adventure, but even that was officially a FR product.  (And it was, again, Primes interfering in planar affairs, not vice-versa.)</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>The Incursion.  Though that doesn't actually require Planescape, just some knowledge of githyanki and the Astral Plane.</p>

<p>There are lots of opportunities for planar involvement in Prime worlds, though, as well as some examples (such the githyanki attempt to colonize Athas in the far past).  Blood War spillover into the Prime is another possibility.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><span style="font-style:italic">Also, be honest, Hyena; when was the last time in-canon that a Planescape event affected goings-on in Toril, Oerth, Krynn...any Prime world, really? It's far more the opposite, in fact. Look at, for example, how the events of Apocalypse Stone completely ruined Moloch's work in Baator. From a meta-view, it's because as a meta setting Planescape would be far more likely to incorporate the events of other settings than other settings were to incorporate the events of Planescape (same as with Ravenloft of Spelljammer)</span></p>

<p>That's more due to not wanting to affect other separate settings than anything else.  The history of Oerth, Toril, and Planescape seems to have quite a few examples of planar goings-ons affecting the prime (and in fact, in my timeline topic I came up with the idea that occurrences on the Inner Planes were responsible for the near-identical natural histories and extinction events of many prime worlds like Toril and Oerth, which many here agreed was a good or at least workable theory)<br />
Many of the settings-- both canon and 3rd party-- involve stories of epic battles waged by deities on the Outer Planes spilling into the prime.  Presumably this would include Iborighu's murder of Hleid from Frostburn, and from the Violet Dawn setting seems to include the war between Temulea and his children (though the story is intentionally very abstract, and it's difficult to tell if the authors intended for the war to take place in Violetspace or not, though the general theme of the gods not appearing physically on Avadnu seems to suggest this war was waged on the planes, with effects on Violetspace as though the land of the gods functioned as a transient plane)<br />
Another example of Outer Planar events affecting the prime is the creation of the Great Glacier from Ulutiu's body (which is actually on the Astral-- so again we see how this affects the Prime.)</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>No doubt everyone thinks their home is the best.  The particular prime giving that speech just got a little snippy momentarily.  ^_^  For what it's worth, despite numbers being tricky to pin down, Sigil probably <span style="font-style:italic">is</span> one of the largest metropoli anywhere short of Dis or the Great Mazework, and it's certainly more accommodating than those two locales.

Not at all.  I recall now that the primary reason for condescension of Primes is that new planewalkers tend to be extremely ignorant of how things work on the planes.  For instance, they see a succubus and think she's some weak damsel they can have sex with, when in reality she's likely to subject them to a fatal dose of BDSM.  Or they'll come to Sigil without some means of leaving. Or they'll make the mistake of referring to a Slaad as a frog (likely considered a derogatory term), or they'll be dumb enough to try and pick pockets without realizing that the Harmonium are watching them.<br />
Or they're from Dragonspace and assume that their steel pieces are worth jack on Sigil, and start marvelling over all the steel structures in the place.<br />
Part of this is also arrogance of course-- many Sigilians view all other cities of the planes as "just some Berg", and view the non-planewalking natives THERE as ignoramuses.  (hence the derogatory term I created for Sigilians as 'Sig'-- which in the Inner Planes is usually combined with a local profanity or blasphemy *generally a word associated with the opposite element-- Outer planar languages are much more complicated, due to the evolution from Dark Speech, True Creation, and the lawful and chaotic equivalents-- similar to English's evolution from Norse, Saxon, etc.*)</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Sigil probably is one of the largest metropoli anywhere short of Dis or the Great Mazework</span></p>

<p>I thought it was the largest one.  Also, the problem with Prime traffic, as mentioned above, is that you always end up with a fair share of "Green Primes" who came to Sigil physically and academically unprepared.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Yes, I know, and I disagree that that's true.  That's a case where I think the canon, taken literally, is just stupid.  I can buy that there are some extreme cases where people just don't get how things work, yeah, or people from worlds with a strange conception of the planes would have the wrong impression of the configuration of the multiverse maybe, but I've never seen a group of PC-run primes act like that at all when they first come to Sigil.  Even accidental arrivals with players that had never played anything Planescape before.  NPCs, maybe, but the kind of people that are most likely to accidentally come to Sigil are adventurers, who if they were stupid enough to make mistakes like that, wouldn't have survived past their first couple adventures anyway.</p>

<p>My own interpretation: I don't see examples like that as how Primes actually act for the most part when they first come to Sigil.  I see examples like that as the horrid stereotypes of Primes when they first come to Sigil.  They're basically the Sigilian equivalent of Polish jokes, only in even worse taste.  It's the sort of anti-Prime othering that led to things such as the blatant bigotry of Cirily's would-be faction.  (I also see that as part of the reason the Harmonium are looked upon so badly, but that's another issue entirely.)</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Those examples are a little weak, though.  I think a big part of the disdain for primers is that they come to the Planes, a big person on their one tiny world, and think that makes them someone big in Sigil and the multiverse.  But they get a thousand heroes of legend from planet Y running through there every day, berk. </p>

<p> It would be like this: You are a big man in your home town; all the girls love you, all the boys want to be you.  You are treated like a prince because you are a sports star, or somesuch thing, and everybody knows you're something special.  Then you move into a metropolitan city like New York and you expect everyone to think you're hot stuff ... but chances are none of the people there have even heard of your little town, couldn't care less if you were allstar quarterback for your team, and find your cocky posing rather absurd ... you may have been big in Smalltown Nowhere, but now you're a fish out of water. (now, instead of New York, change that to Tokyo and you're a small town westerner)</p>

<p>That's how Cagers -and most Planers in general - see Primes.  Sure they are huge names in their one, poorly known world, but now they're in a much bigger fishbowl and everyone who lives out here is used to dealing with stuff on a far grander magnitude.  Those elementals you summon to fight for you on your Prime?  Yeah, I've been to the elemental planes, talked to the unmoving philosphers of stone, shopped and adventured in the City of Brass in the Elemental Plane of fire.  Those undead you butcher on your world?  I've talked magical theory with a Lich, traversed the horrifying boundaries of the Negative Energy plane, and only escaped because I carry a piece of pure creation in my pocket. </p>

<p>In Sigil even your average bartender has had to negotiate prices for a meal with a Baatezu, break up a fight between a Githyanki and a Githzerai, throw down his anti-magic shield to deal with a drunken archmage, and chastise his vampiric waitress for sipping on the clientele.  The BIG BAD STUFF that most adventurers spend their lives fighting or avoiding is part of everyday life for a Cager, and they only survive if they're smart enough, clever enough, confident enough, and know how to play that Multiversal game of Poker Kenny Rogers sings about. (Gotta know when to hold em, fold em, walk away and run) </p>

<p>Cagers are cocky compared to even other Planer travelers, because they live in the single most cosmopolitan city in the Multiverse; and you can't get by there just on your charm and fishing stories.  Hell, I've seen - in a game - a player go from being a 9th level fighter to a homeless man fighting with bums, and losing, because he got rolled in the Hive and had no way to dig himself back out.  And stuff like that happens to Clueless every day.  In my depiction of the setting, Sigil has a near mythical reputation even in the other bergs of the great ring and everywhere inbetween ... to the point where half its reputation is just rumor and hyperbole, but most people are a little more respectful, and a little more frightened of people who call the Cage their kip. (had a great scene in one game where the party defused a potential fight with a group of swaggering mercs simply by telling them they wanted to get back home - to Sigil.  Thing is, they *could* have mopped the floor with those mercs, too, and the players took pride in the fact that they actually lived in the City of Doors.)</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>YPMV, I guess, to borrow a phrase from Greytalk.  But I just can't see the <span style="font-style:italic">average</span> Prime coming to Sigil acting like that.</p>

<p>I mean, let's look at things based on the central conceits of Planescape.  Planescape was designed in part to encourage low-level adventuring on the planes, with Sigil helping to serve as a base for that, right?  So it stands to reason that most Primes coming to Sigil will be low-level sorts.  Medium at best.  Taking that in in-game terms, most Primes coming to Sigil won't be big names back home.  They won't have had a chance to do anything yet on the level of saving a world.  Maybe a kingdom.  But consider most D&amp;D Prime worlds.  They almost always have big names already there.  How big a head will a moderately skilled wizard get in a setting with Khelben Blackstaff?  Or a moderately skilled fighter in a setting with Robilar?  The average Prime coming to Sigil won't have done anything yet to get a huge ego, because the setting was specifically made so that it isn't the people that have done enough to have a huge ego that are the only ones playing around on the planes.</p>

<p>As for the ones that <span style="font-style:italic">have</span> gotten a huge ego, well, Sigilians don't seem to mind them so much as it is anyway.  Let's look at what little evidence there is of people that actually could have deservedly high opinions about themselves coming to Sigil.  There's two examples that come to mind.  First, canonically, concerns about the timeline aside, the College of Bigby was located there, a relatively large campus with a half-dozen buildings, which given how precious real estate is certainly suggests Bigby had some level of prominence in the city.  Second is Duke Rowan Darkwood, and he's probably (pre-Faction War) one of the most powerful men in Sigil.  He's not well liked, sure, but I've never heard him called Clueless.</p>

<p>I know that's the popular conception of the setting, and it's the conception described in the work.  But I just don't see the underpinnings of Sigil supporting a straightforward reading of how Primes act in Sigil.  And besides, if I take your statement at face value, that's akin to saying that the <span style="font-style:italic">majority</span> of people from small towns that head to New York act in that way, which is just silly.</p>

<p>And besides, isn't the common conception of the New Yorker that they have an unreasonably poor opinion of people from outside New York anyway? <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/tongue.png" title="Sticking out tongue" alt="Sticking out tongue" class="smiley-content"/></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Most of the low level people you see in Sigil are going to be born on the planes and have been taught how to behave and survive there; the vast majority of them will be members of factions or sects and have a working idea of how to relate to their environment.  If you grew up in Tokyo, you are going to be significantly more informed on how to behave and survive in Tokyo than some tourist from Oregon.  In fact, if you've ever lived in a tourist town you'll realize how irritating the "clueless" behavior of these people can be ... and that's just visitors from out of state or - more dramatically - another nation.  Imagine how significantly worse that would be when dealing with tourists from another world.  </p>

<p>Clueless are wandering around, gawking at everything, misusing local terminology, going to areas they aren't welcome, asking the most basic questions - that to you are common, remedial knowledge, and so forth.  No, not every single clueless is going to fall into these categories ... some people are more savvy about travel etiquette, but those aren't the most common people, so they aren't setting the groundwork from which the stereotypes are formed.  Stereotypes exist for a reason, even when there are exceptions.  (typically because they are the loudest and most recognizable)  And let's face it, as much as we Planescape players and game masters know about Sigil, we'd still be gawking idiots if we suddenly ended up there.</p>

<p>It's going to be a rare thing to have a party of low level primes stumbling into the Planes.  Can it happen?  Sure ... and these people make up a large portion of the business done by the morgue, the Gatehouse, and filling the gutters of the hive until they are eaten by something.  The very clever will manage to survive and thrive, but by that time they're not clueless anymore.  </p>

<p>One does not remain clueless forever ... though Cagers like to say, "either you're a cager or your not", that doesn't mean the fact you originated on some Prime means you'll always be a berk.  Bigby was probably clueless when he stumbled into the Planes, too, but he was powerful enough not to be swallowed up by them while he learned the ropes.  I'm guessing you could find some greybeard with stories about Bigby angering some Baatezu, being chased down by Hard Heads and trying to convince some Bleakers things aren't as bad as they seem.  The same goes for Darkwood, who also found himself a place in a Faction, which is often the first step in curing yourself of being clueless.  But I guarantee you neither of those people look at the universe the way they did when the stepped off their Prime worlds.  They are always going to be attached to their Prime in some way, and may never get over the misconception that it is more important than it really is ... but that is a personal bias born from an circumstance of birth.  But in the scheme of the multiverse Oerth is no more important than Krynn or Earth, or anything else.  </p>

<p>Coming to the planes is, typically, a much more unlikely event for the average person than moving from their small town into the big city ... and many people never accomplish even that!  Hell, most adventurers already have an overblown opinion of themselves - no matter if they've saved a few towns or an entire continent - just ready to be squashed the second they step into the planes.  </p>

<p>You step through that portal and suddenly most of what you thought you knew was wrong ... you might be a professor in your world, but suddenly you know less about the multiverse than a child raised in Sigil.  The bad rep comes from the people who can't come to terms with that.  </p>

<p>And again, Sauron, Voldemort, they're still stuck trying to take over their own worlds - and compete with the forces fighting against them there - and when they're done they are, what - in the scheme of things?  They're the equivalents of the "Grand overlord of Shelbyville".  Elsewhere a group of adventurers has just stopped (or initiated) a shift of belief that would influence thousands of Prime material worlds.  Planers simple tend to play more dangerous games with higher stakes.  (and, seriously, Voldemort is - what - effectively an 18th level mage?  Impressive, sure, but on the Planes that isn't what it is in London.)</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>^^Exactly.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">maybe, but the kind of people that are most likely to accidentally come to Sigil are adventurers, who if they were stupid enough to make mistakes like that, wouldn't have survived past their first couple adventures anyway.</span><br />
Well, that's part of the problem.  Plenty of people who end up in Sigil AREN'T adventurers-- they're low-level adventurers (at best) who stumbled into a portal.  Also, the "survival past first couple adventures" thing depends partly on the adventures in question-- an adventuring party could go through 2-3 adventures and never encounter a single drow, erinyes, or succubus.  Maybe their first adventure involved orcs, leading to ogres, leading to giants, and then their second involved dinosaurs and mammalian megabeasts *such as elephants and rhinos*, leading to a juvenile or young adult green dragon.<br />
Well, at that point, they've never had the opportunity to make the mistake of flirting with the Drow priestess or grabbing her boobs.  And the other encounters would have mostly involved dumb, aggressive creatures requiring stealth rather than diplomacy or "if you don't know what it is, don't talk to it".<br />
For that matter, such adventures would also leave them ill-prepared for polymorphed dopplegangers or outsiders *although they probably encountered some illusions during their first quest*</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>First - YPMV?</p>

<p>The technology question reminded me of something from the novel Prospero Lost - that science works not because the world really works like that, but Prospero created a system of alliances with all the spirits of the world to make the world run in a way to allow for technology to advance.</p>

<p>Similar spirits in the D&amp;D worlds likely aren't interested in doing anything of the sort, and we see in Eberron that they had to be tasked if not enslaved to do so.</p>

<p>Regarding clueless, I think that planars coming from the outlying, non-cosmopolitan areas of their planes are at a much bigger disadvantage than primes. Imagine coming from Elyisum to Sigil - even if you are aware, theoretically, of how things really work it must be jarring to realize these jerks are getting where they want to go because the rules of the Traveler's Way don't apply.</p>

<p>I also think people coming from Oerth would have a better sense of the planes than other prime worlds, I think the prime world you come from should determine how planars react to you. Some worlds should have resonance on the planes, I think in one of his novels Gygax noted Oerth was a magical nexus or energy resevoir of some sort.</p>

<p>Really, it depends on the characters of Sigil itself. I'd rather have a more mixed reaction than planars dismissing primes as clueless, but admittedly it can be fun sometimes to do so.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Part of that is indeed just generalizing and discrimination, of course.  And, like I said, the same problem exists on the Inner and Outer planes-- Genies view themselves as superior to everything else, and most elementals view themselves as superior to fleshy beings (whom they call "fleshlings"), though there is a certain degree of respect for elemental outsiders.  Discrimination against mephits is absolutely rampant, with most types of elementals and elemental outsiders refusing to even view them as people.  Ice and Mineral are among the only planes where they get along with/are viewed as equals by the other indigenous races (mostly due to indifference on Ice and necessity on Mineral)</p>

<p>Oerth and Toril are the two Prime worlds with the most accurate view of the cosmology, though moralists (yes, Al Qadim definition) on both prime worlds, of any deity, hold an extremely skewed view (for the unaware, moralists are the type of faithful in Al Qadim who believe that their faith and their viewpoints are the ONLY correct ones and that any other view and faith is tantamount to blasphemy-- blatantly based off of the Abrahamic faiths and IIRC Zoroastrianism.)</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I think even if elementals were willing to aid mortals create technology, the Multiverse simply doesn't work the way our reality does. What is lightning but a by-product of air+positive? Fire is a chemical reaction in our reality, in the Multiverse it is one of the foundations of reality. Darkness can be real, a material thing in D&amp;D as opposed to the absence of light.</p>

<p>I think that one can use rationality and the scientific method to make advancements, but they will resemble something along the lines of Eberron rather than the products of our world.</p>

<p>All that said, I would love to see ideas for high-tech but different enough from our world that seeing their presence doesn't break my personal suspension of disbelief.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>sciborg2</em> wrote:</div>First - YPMV?</div></p>

<p>"Your Planescape May Vary"; "Your Greyhawk May Vary" was a pretty common comment on the Greytalk mailing list when this sort of disagreement came up. <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/tongue.png" title="Sticking out tongue" alt="Sticking out tongue" class="smiley-content"/></p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Really, it depends on the characters of Sigil itself. I'd rather have a more mixed reaction than planars dismissing primes as clueless, but admittedly it can be fun sometimes to do so.</div></p>

<p>This is basically how I feel on the issue.  I mean, so many of the examples that have come up so far, I literally have no idea how even starting adventurers could be so stupid as to do them, in Planescape or otherwise.</p>

<p>I mean, have you guys defending Clueless as being a reasonable term instead of a stereotype seriously been in campaigns where one of the PCs would go up and start attacking a fiend walking down the street when literally no one else on the street even reacted to them?  Or where they would go up to some random woman and start molesting her in public just because she's wearing Drow priestess-wear?  Coming to Sigil without a way out is a mistake anyone can make, Prime or not.  Being misled by a succubus is what succubi do, and planars can be victims just as much as anyone.  (In canon even, look at <span style="font-style:italic">Harbinger House</span>.  This wasn't some Prime, this was a major high-up in the Believers of the Source in charge of one of their most important facilities and entrusted with one of their major artifacts, and a succubus still tricked him.)  Even calling a slaad a frog, I don't even know if that's a mistake a planar not familiar with Limbo wouldn't make, even a Sigilian.</p>

<p>I know I'm arguing anecdote vs. anecdote here, but all the examples that have come up so far (except steel pieces from Krynn, I'll grant you that one) fall into one of two categories for me: anyone could do it, Prime or not, or it wouldn't actually happen, even from a Prime.  And I'm saying that from my own experience in D&amp;D, not even characters I've played but rather characters I've played with, either as DM or as a player myself.</p>

<p>I just cannot agree with this assumption that Sigilians are <span style="font-style:italic">right</span>, and I never even considered that that was the intended interpretation of Planescape stuff.  The existence of Cirily's sect was just more evidence to me that the Clueless stuff was never intended to be acceptable or correct, just the arrogance of Sigilians that, for all their talk about being so knowledgeable about the planes, completely forget about Center of All.  (In fact, if you look through the material, you'll see Rule of Threes and Unity of Rings brought up way more often than Center of All, especially in Sigil-based stuff; almost as if they don't want to acknowledge it as a philosophical underpinning because it would point against Sigil's importance.)</p>

<p>Some more evidence to me: a lot of them point to how some Primes don't get how the planes are really put together.  Some examples are pretty silly, yes, like Krynnish thinking everywhere is the Abyss.  But others are subtler issues like the arrangement of the planes; metaphysical questions, basically.  And yet every time some Sigilian mentions a greybeard's metaphysical theory (for example, the old arrangement of the Inner Planes in the Wavefire entry in PSMCIII), they dismiss it out of hand because greybeards don't know what they're talking about.  They simultaneously dismiss both Primes and intellectuals for saying things that disagree with their own personally-held common knowledge, without having any care about if the common knowledge is correct or not.  It just so happens that Primes probably are wrong, but all the evidence points to Sigilians not caring about that part.  They just care that the Primes are <span style="font-style:italic">disagreeing</span> with them.</p>

<p>I do have to mention one other thing too:</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>Jack of tears</em> wrote:</div>
Stereotypes exist for a reason, even when there are exceptions. 
</div></p>

<p>Yes, they do exist for a reason.  To otherize a group of outsiders.  Not necessarily purposefully, or even consciously, but stereotypes are universally only to allow you to set your group apart from another group as better than they are.  The same is true for stereotypes in real life, it's people blowing a minor set of events noticed through the filter of confirmation bias out of proportion and applying it to a wide mass, assuming it applies to everyone because the people it doesn't applied to aren't as prominent to the person watching them.  Stereotypes exist essentially because the human brain is a pattern-finding engine, it looks for patterns even where none exist, and when these stereotypes emerge from it, they allow people to treat outsiders as a large mass rather than a collection of individuals in order to make it easier to ostracize or belittle them.</p>

<p>I'm certainly not accusing anyone here of that, of course, since in the end we're just talking about fictional characters in a game.  But Jack, it sounds like you're from a tourist town yourself (I might be wrong about that).  How do you know the majority of tourists act the way you describe?  I mean, you wouldn't even be able to recognize the tourists that don't act the way you're describing, because since they don't act the way you're describing, they wouldn't stand out as tourists.  You can't have any sense as to what proportion of tourists act that way without holding some kind of survey to figure out who is and who isn't, all you can do is identify people that act the way you're describing.  That makes this the sort of statement that can easily fall to confirmation bias.  And confirmation bias is a tenacious thing that is so subtle it almost becomes unnoticeable, and it's really easy to succumb to it.  It's like the mental equivalent of a blind spot, the brain just paints right over it unless you go out of your way to force it into appearance.</p>

<p>(I really hope you don't take that personally, Jack, because I don't intend that at all.  We're just having a neat debate about RP funtimes, that's all.  I was wary about even using what you said as an example, but it seemed so illustrative of what I meant that I couldn't help it.  If I did offend you with bringing that out in particular, I definitely apologize for it.)</p>

<p>It's possible that that's what happens in Sigil too, of course.  There's a small percentage of Primes that do make excrutiatingly stupid mistakes when they arrive in Sigil.  These are the Primes that get recognized, because the Primes that don't make those mistakes aren't identified as Prime unless they announce themselves as such.  So everyone assumes <span style="font-style:italic">all</span> Primes act stupid.  And when a Sigilian meets a Prime that doesn't act that way, they must simply be "one of the good ones".</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>This is pretty much what I said when I noted that some people are more savvy about travel etiquette than others.  Some people will blend in better, because they are either more aware of the fact that they're outsiders and don't want to make fools of themselves, or they're well traveled and used to avoiding the goofs most tourists make.  </p>

<p>As to your question, yes I used to live in a tourist town and tourists aren't really that hard to pick out - as there are certain locations they congregate to and certain behaviors they tend to indulge in. (one of those being making quite clear they are tourists)  And while it is true not all tourists are bad ... probably no more than half of them ... it's always the idiots that create the stereotype.  </p>

<p>Speaking of stereotypes, they don't only exist as an, "us vs them" shorthand, (though certainly that is one of the functions they serve) but also as a tool for noting certain behaviors in certain peoples.  It is simply a truism that a majority of certain cultures behave in certain ways ... because that is the cultural norm for them. (nothing wrong with a stereotype if not used to discriminate; not all stereotypes are bad, after all)  Obviously not all people from that culture behave in that fashion, but it is prevalent enough to have been recognized and associated with that group.  (again, I'm going to state "not *all* stereotypes are bad", certainly there are some which are made for the sole purpose of discriminating against others ... so one has to consider who is using the stereotype as well) </p>

<p>I'm not going to even comment on your list of things you've never seen people do in a game for two reasons.  First, I think that list was a little exaggerated (by the individual who mentions those examples earlier in the thread), and second: PCs really can't be held up as the norm.  For one, players are more sensitive and careful of their actions because they know the GM is watching ... in real life people behave in idiotic ways all the time, because they don't feel they are being actively watched or tested on their behavior.  And second, players have a metaknowledge that they are dealing with creatures more powerful than they, with stats to reflect this, etc.  A Player comes into a game with far more knowledge about the "universe" (the DnD universe that is) than even many seasoned adventurers would have.  They have had the benefit of looking at monster manuals, adventures, settings, etc.  So while their characters may be Clueless, it is far less common to find clueless players ... and this simply bleeds through, whether they intend it to or not.  </p>

<p>I think it clear that Cagers are supposed to be perceived as elitist jerks, but at the same time they have a lot of reason to be ... as I stated elsewhere, your average Cager is going to run into and deal with a far more diverse populace than even many experienced Planeswalkers ... simply because they live in *the* biggest and most popular planar hub.  (I use the example of the bartender previously in the thread to illustrate this)  An individual raised in the Cage, or who spends a great deal of time there, is going to know how to deal with a huge variety of races because he needs to in order to survive; so he'll know how to come out of petty bargains with Baatezu without losing his soul, how to distinguish a Githyanki from a Githzeri, what color Slaad you absolutely must avoid, and have a basic understanding of which Factions you can deal straight with and which you can't. (and, for that matter, most Primes coming into the planes are going to be completely clueless about the Factions and what they represent - the idea that belief can shape the planes, and so forth.  Most will simply never have had access to these ideas)</p>

<p>As to the "Center of All" thing, I don't believe that was in the original release of the setting, so you can't accuse Cagers of being ignorant because they don't recognize something which hasn't been written into the material yet.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Actually, I think the three precepts were in the PSCS, though I could be wrong on that, yeah.  But I'm pretty sure I remember reading them even in the first box set.</p>

<p>And I think in the end, it looks like we aren't that far apart in how we see things, it's just a question of scale.  Something I think we can settle on agreeing to disagree, really.  I can see more where you're coming from now, yeah, and I can see that kind of stuff definitely.  I think it's just that most of the examples even in the book really do have them as being as exaggerated as some of the examples upthread, which always rankled me.  Then again, most of the books are usually from a Sigilian perspective, which could explain it.</p>

<p>...You know, that actually gives me an idea.  A Planescape book or module or something, in-character same as so many other books, but from a Prime perspective.  That could be a really interesting piece, I think. <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/lol.png" title="Laughing out loud" alt="Laughing out loud" class="smiley-content"/></p>

<p>Edit: Oh!  Even better!  A Spelljammer book or module, in-character, written for <span style="font-style:italic">planars</span> that are heading to the Prime for some Spelljamming.  I've always loved the idea of there being some sort of feud between planewalkers and spelljammers, and seeing the tables turned like that could be hilarious and awesome.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>One thing you also have to remember about stereotypes and generalizations:  At the end of the day, it's the people doing something wrong who are going to stand out, while the majority doing something right or normal are not noticed.  We see this IRL with generalizations and even news coverage (which sensationalizes and focuses on scandal and fearmongering because that's what people want to watch-- people want to hear about the scary stuff, scandals, etc. because the scandals are interesting, the scary stuff is useful in their eyes to self preservation, and hearing about people doing what is everyday or what is expected is boring)</p>

<p>Just like, I remember a few times in school, one or two out of 30 students would be jeering at me for fumbling in a class spelling bee, but it SEEMED like 1/3rd of the class was jeering at me.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I like the idea of a Prime perspective on the planes, as well as the spelljammer guide for planars.</p>

<p>I think the idea, originally, was to emulate the tourist town where locals look down on yokels. What I think kind of got missed a lot of times were the number of powerful primes - especially the planet of Ortho.</p>

<p>Perhaps the books should have been more explicit, but PCs should over time overcome the prejudice of the planes even as they take in the vastness of them in relation to their home world.</p>

<p>I think the usual relative insignificance of a single Prime is more realistic than the idea that infinite (or even light year spanning) planes exist with focus around a single mortal world.</p>

<p>BUT I think there can be some worlds that have importance on the planes, as Oerth obviously does. I think D&amp;D players seem to like the spotlight, which is understandable. Call of Cthullu is really more for the insignificance of mortal life.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I really think that is only an issue if your players come from Oerth, Krynn, or somesuch.  Most of my games involve native planers, born in Sigil, the outlands, or other non-prime locations, so the idea that Oerth is insignificant doesn't bother them.  (though I recently had a player who portrayed the first Prime to travel from her world and that was rather fun ... she was a princess on her own prime and behaved like everything revolved around her and her world) </p>

<p>I seem to recall, in my early years of running Planescape, though, that one of my players had a difficult time accepting it when Cagers where dismissive of Oerth, from whence he had come.  This was still back in the day when DnD pretty much revolved around Oerth and the Forgotten Realms so - because they were big names in the game itself - he couldn't wrap his mind around the idea that they weren't big names in Sigil. (in fact, he kept trying to compare Sigil to the capital city of Greyhawk)</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>I like the ideas of tech items lacking protection and being destroyed by certain magic using merchants. Maybe some magic could just inadvertently cause electronics to fry?</p>

I don't see why the tools would be difficult to create. But that's probably besides the point as the topic is just looking for reasons why technology hasn't advanced past a certain point on the planes; and I think a number of good suggestions have been made</p>

<p>I did enjoy your jokes though</div><br />
Do you know why the Analytical Engine couldn't be built? It wasn't that Babbage's ideas on it were unfounded, or that his blueprints wouldn't have worked. It was that, at the time, they couldn't machine parts fine and precise enough to actually construct it. Tools are extremely, extremely important to technology, and they aren't guaranteed to be available.</p>

<p>.<br />
WRT the original question,</p>

<p>The Inner Planes can be categorized and divided by their elements. This one is the plane of fire, and that other one is the plane of earth. Their different elements are what make them different.</p>

<p>The Outer Planes can be categorized by by belief, in d&amp;d terms they are organized by their alignments. This plane is a place of chaos and good, while that place is chaos and evil.</p>

<p>The Prime Material Worlds can be categorized by the culture and technology of their people. That is the big, dividing, thing for them. That's what makes one Prime unique compared to all of the others. Culture and technology. If Planars hold Primes in such contempt, why would they want to embrace their ways of life and spread <span style="font-style:italic">their</span> ideas, and <span style="font-style:italic">their</span> tools across the Planes?</p>

<p>Spreading technology and ideas from a prime across Mechanus is as natural and intuitive to a planar as spreading the chaos of Limbo, or the evils of Baator. Trying to do it makes you a supporter of the supremacy of that idea -- that <span style="font-style:italic">prime</span> - and an enemy of the ideas of the other planes. You want Mechanus to become influenced, tainted, by this other plane and <span style="font-style:italic">it's</span> ideas? You think they're superior to the ways of Mechanus? I don't think the natives will be very happy with you.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">
