          The disappearance (and return?) of Gith        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
        <div class="dice_rolls">
</div> <p>As quoted earlier, from the Guide to the Astral Plane:</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Soon after the githyanki had established themselves in the virtually lifeless Astral, a wizard4ess named Vlaakith began advising Gith on matters of state. She advised the ruler that the Githyanki were in need of allies, and Gith reluctantly agreed. After a failed attempt to gain the slaadi, Limbo's native race, as allies against the githzerai, Vlaakith advised Gith to descend into Baator to meet with the legendary Tiamat.</p>

<p>What actually occurred at that meeting is one of the best-kept secrets in all the planes. Simply put, no one knows but Gith, Tiamat, and apparently one of Tiamat's consorts, a red great worm named Ephelomon. What is known is that Ephelomon came to the Astral and instructed Vlaakith that Gith had named the wizardess as the githyanki leader's successor, and that she was to carry on her legacy of conquest, for Gith would not be returning. The great worm also announced that an eternal pact between red dragons and the githyanki was now in place.</div></p>

<p>It's critical to any discussion of the outcome of Vlaakith CLVII's destruction to go back to these strange events which crowned Vlaakith I as Gith's successor.</p>

<p>What of Tiamat? Was Gith the victim of duplicity on the part of the dragon? While that's entirely possible, the subservience of the red dragons for millennia afterwards would seem to indicate an honest bargain where both sides gave something valuable in order to receive something they considered equally valuable. Yes, this does help the dragons a bit, but it helps the githyanki considerably more. Particularly since the dragons *serve* the githyanki. Also, recall that in "The Lich-Queen's Beloved", the destruction of the Staff of Ephelomon immediately renders the pact with red dragons null and void, so the bargain is more than mere words. The githyanki lost Gith, and received the incredibly valuable resource of red dragons to aid them in their conquests. What, exactly, was the price Gith paid them for this ongoing service?</p>

<p>What of Gith? Destroyed or not? The idea of Gith somehow voluntarily sacrificing herself to Tiamat somehow rings false. She would be depriving her people of her galvanizing leadership, while merely gaining an alliance. Perhaps she did so in exchange for the promise that Tiamat would do whatever necessary to prevent the githyanki from ever suffering a wide-scale genocide or enslavement? Any of these things could be true, but it doesn't really add up.</p>

<p>Was Gith's disappearance a well-crafted plot by Vlaakith to seize the throne? If so, it was an elaborate one. Again, note the existence of the Staff of Ephelomon and the service of red dragons. The pact with Tiamat in fact exists. If it was Vlaakith that traded with the dragons, what did she have to offer? The head of her leader, while perhaps of interest to Tiamat, would have hardly been adequate payment for thousands of years of dragon service.  The red dragons that cooperate with githyanki receive easy loot and conquest, and that is of some benefit to Tiamat's long-term plans to spread the influence of evil dragons. Is it the githyanki who actually serve the dragons, in a way? Again, the fact that the dragons stop supporting the githyanki when the Staff is destroyed would indicate that they would prefer to not assist the githyanki if they were not bound by Tiamat's agreement.</p>

<p>Perhaps Gith went on some important mission for Tiamat, performing a task that the dragon found impossible to do without her assistance. It must have been an epic task to merit an open-ended promise of aid from red dragons from that point onward for thousands of years. What could it have been? We know that a "short time" after Gith met Tiamat, Ephelomon comes with the message of the pact. So had Gith already died attempting to do something for Tiamat, or was she merely unable to return? Either way, she succeeded at acquiring the aid of the dragons, so in at least that respect, her mission was a success.</p>

<p>So without knowing how or why Gith disappeared, there is no way to know if she might return, either in her original physical form, or as one reincarnated with the spirit of Gith. Is it possible that her pact with Tiamat also included the provision that Tiamat arrange for her return should her people ever need her? The so-called gods certainly won't be provided that service to Gith's heathen people. </p>

<p>The githyanki have no doubt discussed all these scenarios, and many more. And I'm sure the theories have become increasingly elaborate in the eons since Gith first left on that ill-fated errand. The points above are merely a starting point for a more detailed discussion of the possible scenarios of those events, and the ways in which they might impact the current drastic events that are even now shaping the next era in githyanki history. </p>

<p>The successor of Gith is gone, with no heir. What will become of the throne of Gith if it is  simply taken by the most powerful and influential githyanki? What will become of the traitors who committed blasphemy by arranging for the attack on Vlaakith? What will these events do to the well-established and strict boundaries of Githyanki culture and society?</p>

<p>And what will happen when the githyanki equivalents of religion and prophecy, come into play? When githyanki realize that they are once again in a time of monumental change, a time of future legends?</p>

          Gith        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>It must be remembered that, ultimately, the githyanki (and githzerai) are "human", in the loosest sense of the term.  Whatever bargain was struck between Gith and Vlaakith I and Tiamat, included obviously Gith's absence for whatever reason.  I suppose that Gith herself was reasonably powerful, so she might have become one of Tiamat's favored servant in Baator, or some such.  True, the "deal" for red dragon assistance (to characterize it as servitude is excessive, and some sources specifically speak of it as an equal partnership) seems to favor the githyanki, but god-only-knows what Gith herself had to offer.  Vlaakith seems to be a secondary figure.  Perhaps Tiamat makes the deal in the hope that (or expectation based on knowledge of the future) Gith herself, now in the "care" of Tiamat, will/may someday return to the Githyanki and bring the whole of that race (and maybe the human race as well) into "the fold", in a Power-going-for-the-big-money sort of way.  Face it, humanity is the ultimate worshiper-base on the Prime.  There is no race so successful or so widespread as humans.  Githyanki, as a human off-shoot, are a major prize.  In the long-term, multiversally speaking, they might be the only prize that matters.  And if the gith races can be instrumental in the development of humanity as a base of divine power, then Tiamat may already be in a unique position to "corner the market", under certain circumstances.  I mean, really, most of Western mythology is based, one way or another, on the story of the Assyrian god Marduk making the world out of the body of Tiamat.....................  Tiamat's "revenge", so to speak, might be the coopting of the human race for her own ends.  I digress, therefore I stop.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

          The disappearance (and return?) of Gith        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>I've always been fond of my theory, that Tiamat gave Gith to the highest bidder, entity who wanted her the most - Ilsensine, whose thirst for vengeance against the woman who destroyed the illithid empire ran deep. Ilsensine, in return, gave Tiamat the sort of payment a greater god can give - an entire world, perhaps, or another major sphere of influence. The death of a rival. Something pretty that she can wear at clubs.</p>

<p>Ilsensine, after torturing Gith for a millennium, realized the best revenge possible - he implanted an illithid larva in her, transforming her into the species she hated the most. But for such a special host, only a special tadpole would do - a divine tadpole, suitable to create an illithid god. An illithid god, who consumed the soul of the being whose body it transformed to create itself.</p>

<p>This is how Maanzecorian came to be, and why it is only now, aeons later, with Maanzecorian's destruction that the soul of Gith is finally free.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>to characterize it as servitude is excessive, and some sources specifically speak of it as an equal partnership</div>
Calling something an "equal partership" where one party uses the others as mounts is stretching it. Particularly when the party being ridden is a member of an unbelievably egotistical race, and is considerably more powerful than the rider in most cases. Whether it is referred to as equal or not, servile behavior is expected on the part of the dragons, and that behavior is contrary to both their nature as well as contrary to Tiamat's feelings about dragons' ultimate role in the cosmos. It just doesn't add up.</p>

<p>Tiamat obviously got something she wanted *very* badly, but I see very little indicating what that was. It certainly wasn't simply the opportunity to possess Gith as an anonymous slave. Something stinks here.</p>

<p>Also, keep in mind Vlaakith's bid for godhood, using red dragons to create the duthka'gith. Was Tiamat involved, making a move to somehow gain an advantage? Even if that's not the case, I'm quite certain Vlaakith's gambit would not have escaped Tiamat's notice. Does this in any way affect the red dragon pact?</p>

<p>Of course, Rip brings up at least one scenario where Tiamat may have bartered the reletively worthless Gith for something she valued more, to someone who wanted Gith in particular.  Interesting!</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;Invisig0th&#039;</em> wrote:</div>Your story states "serve the githyanki...". If anything, that supports my point.</div></p>

<p>Not to be too snide, but I wrote it and know what my intentions were. Dragons serve the githyanki because the githyanki serve them; it's a partnership, like that between the Melniboneans and their dragons (the Phoorn) in Michael Moorcock's novels, or like that of the Dragonriders of Pern in McCaffery's books.</p>

<p>My idea, which isn't disputed anywhere in published sources, was that the deal didn't stop with Gith; githyanki agreed to a continuous service to the red dragons in perpetuity. Each time they call a dragon they have to offer it a significant sacrifice. They may have to perform other favors for the dragons as well. We know Gith formed some sort of pact with Tiamat's consort, but we don't know the details of this. I assume that I'm right, and it was a mutual alliance. Gith's disappearance may have been entirely incidental to the details of the agreement.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>"Gith's disappearance may have been entirely incidental to the details of the agreement."</p>

<p>That's quite possible. That's a very good point.</p>

<p>As to what you meant with your story, all I can go on is the words you wrote. If you meant it to be both parties "serving" each other, I don't see that mentioned as such in this story. You mention the dragons serving githyanki, but you didn't mention githyanki serving dragons as such. Youdescribe the githyanki giving the dragons valuable things, but that is not servitiude. that is at best a tribute, and at worst a bribe. </p>

<p>IMHO, a pile of gold is small compensation for letting someone saddle up and ride you like a flying horse. I just don't see how that  sits well with the incredible ego and general feelings of superiority that red dragons are notorious for.  The dragons seem to be getting the short end of the deal. Conjectures in the direction of your story even the scales a bit (no pun intended), but in my mind the bargain remains heavily slanted in favor of the githyanki. I find no evidence of the githyanki serving the red dragons except perhaps in a poetic sense.  The dragons, however, serve in a literal sense.</p>

<p>Allies don't serve each other. They cooperate. Red dragons are consistently said in all available sources to "serve" the githyanki. The Guide to the Astral Plane states that red dragons are "compelled to work with" the githyanki, and that "normally it's the younger members of the species that are forced to heed the call". One cannot claim that being "forced" to serve someone is the same as voluntary working with them. I've seen no description of what the githyanki do in return other than references that say the dragons get some loot and a warm place to live. The role of a servant is undeniably out of character for dragons, and I believe it is reasonable to question why they would tolerate it.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Githyanki are no less arrogant. They swallow their own pride and treat the dragons with deference. </p>

<p>Honestly, I don't think dragons would find carrying allies degrading (I specifically mentioned the absence of saddles, note). I suspect they carry their humanoid slaves/servants in such a way all the time (it leaves their claws free to carry other things), and this is no different. </p>

<p>Look at the Dragonlance series for another example - the Dragon Highlords rode evil dragons, but there was never a hint that they were superior to them. If anything, the dragons were running the show (this is certainly true in Lord Toede's case).</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>  The dragons seem to be getting the short end of the deal. </div></p>

<p>I don't agree. There are any number of advantages to an alliance with a planar race as powerful as the githyanki. Red dragons have many enemies, from humanoids to their metallic cousins. There's no reason they should see carrying someone around as humiliating - it's a position of great superiority, if you think about it. When a githyanki rides a red dragon through the air, she's trusting it with her life. The dragon has the githyanki at its mercy, should she fail to uphold her half of the pact. It's as if the githyanki agreed to be carried around in the dragon's mouth.</p>

<p>The horse analogy isn't one that a dragon would care much about. Dragons don't ride horses - they eat them. Githyanki don't ride beings they consider inferior (at least in <a href="http://planewalker.com/rrakkma/node/" class="bb-url">my version</a>, nightmares are considered the siblings of the knights who ride them), and red dragons are probably more familiar with githyanki traditions than human ones.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Allies don't serve each other. They cooperate.</div></p>

<p>These are mostly chaotic evil beings we're talking about. "Serving one another" is probably as close to cooperation as you're going to get.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>I've seen no description of what the githyanki do</div></p>

<p>Use your imagination. It's not hard to think of any number of things the githyanki might do for them, as a nation and as individuals. I don't think it's reasonable or interesting to think of dragons as the githyankis' slaves, not when there are so many other possibilities. It seems to me that it's common sense that Ephelemon and Tiamat would have bargained for the best deal possible.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>The role of a servant is undeniably out of character for dragons, and I believe it is reasonable to question why they would tolerate it.</div></p>

<p>Exactly. Because the role of servant is unreasonable, it's reasonable to assume that's not their role. While nothing in print specifies what githyanki might do for their allies, neither does it say they do nothing. The interpretation, therefore, is up to us - does it make more sense to assume theirs is an alliance of mutual benefit, or to assume that githyanki have a one-sided mastery over a chaotic species due to a pact that took place eons before? </p>

<p>I've presented, in this thread, what I think is a very elegant solution to the problem.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>I don't think your question is invalid. Which is why I asked that question myself in the first post of this thread.</p>

<p>However, the description of red dragons serving githyanki isn't vauge or even open to interpretation. The docs say the dragons serve the githyanki, and are even "forced" to do so. That's simply not a description of a voluntary action, or a situation among peers. It's conscription. </p>

<p>To say that evil allies "serve each other" is using poetic license to describe simple cooperation in which no one plays the role of servant and no one the role of master. Cooperation and servitude are mutually exclusive scenarios. This scenario is clearly described as one party "serving" the other.</p>

<p>That said, your explanation is certainly an arguably valid extrapolation filling in the parts that the books don't say. You're absolutely right to say that the holes need to be filled in with imaginination. That particular explanation doesn't happen to ring true with me, and there appears to be at least a bit of direct evidence to the contrary. You are certainly welcome to disregard that evidence.</p>

<p>In some respects, it is the easy way out to simply expand the service of the dragons into cooperation among equals. You are correct, this is a common theme in dragon fiction. </p>

<p>However, the idea that the dragons dislike the servitude that is dictated by Tiamat is more intriguing  Provided the orders are coming from Tiamat, it's easy to see why they would comply, albeit begrudgingly. The only only open question is: what did Tiamat gain that compensated her for offering her powerful dragon followers up as involunatary servants for all time? Provided she got something spectacular out of the deal, my theory is logically sound, doesn't contradict any sources, and still renders the dragons as selfish and egotistical as they are portrayed in the D&amp;D source material.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Your quote is out of context. They're forced by older dragons, not by the githyanki. However, that doesn't mean they're getting a raw deal, or that the service isn't mutual. AGttAP goes on to say, "The githyanki respect these powerful friends and generally use them as efficiently as possible..." If they're friends, they're not slaves, as you seem to think.</p>

<p>Here is what the entry for githyanki in the <span style="font-style:italic">Planescape Monstrous Compendium Appendix One</span>:</p>

<p>"On the Prime Material Plane, githyanki have a pact with a group of red dragons. These proud creatures act as mounts <span style="font-weight:bold">and companions</span> to the githyanki." [Emphasis mine] I would argue that companionship is incompatible with servitude.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">A Guide to the Astral Plane</span> said: "Whenever, wherever the githyanki arrived on the Prime, red dragons were <span style="font-weight:bold">willing</span> to work with them in their schemes and goals." [Again, emphasis mine]. So it's explicitly voluntary. Voluntary for red dragons in general, I assume, although specific dragons may force younger dragons to go in their steads.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Cooperation and servitude are mutually exclusive scenarios. This scenario is clearly described as one party "serving" the other. </div></p>

<p>The only use of the word "serve" is in one fan-created article (mine). While it may have connotations of servitude, it has other meanings as well (see <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=serve" class="bb-url">the dictionary definition</a>. </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>However, the idea that the dragons dislike the servitude that is dictated by Tiamat is more intriguing</div></p>

<p>Obviously, I disagree. I think it's more interesting to consider that an eons-old, mutually beneficial partnership was forcibly severed to the dismay of both dragons and githyanki. Yet without the magical link between the two, how can they find one another? How can they prevent rogue dragons from attacking their former allies (for, as beneficial as it might have been, there will always be dissenters).</p>

<p>I like the idea of powerful dragons and githyanki working seperately to reforge the artifact - with the help of the PCs, of course. </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>My theory is logically sound</div></p>

<p>I don't necessarily disagree with the substance of your premise, only the details. I like the idea of an alliance far more than slavery, but I don't dispute that magic and some amount of compulsion was involved to smooth the way - these are chaotic evil creatures we're talking about, after all. But I don't agree that Ephelemon and Tiamat would give their followers a blatantly disadvantageous deal - an alliance is all Gith asked for, and it's all she needed. Slavery of dragons to a humanoid race would be anathema<br />
to Tiamat, and it's not something she needs to promise. I think the idea she would promise such a thing is not logically sound.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I maintain my idea fits the published material better than yours, as outlined in the quotes above.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Your quote is out of context. They're forced by older dragons, not by the githyanki.</div>
I said they were forced by Tiamat, not by githyanki. And therefore, the quote is not out of context. </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>If they're friends, they're not slaves, as you seem to think. </div>
I absolutely do not think that, nor have I stated anything of the kind. I have correctly referred to the fact that the source material says that the red dragons "serve" the githyanki. A servant is not a slave. The terms are not interchangable. </p>

<p>Example:Alfred is Batman's butler. Alfred is Batman's friend. Alfred is a servant. Alfred is not a slave. </p>

<p>Please try not to read things into my posts that I do not actually say. I'm usually pretty specific about my word choices.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>The only use of the word "serve" is in one fan-created article (mine). </div>
Nope. The 3E Manual of the Planes and the 3E Monster Manual both say "Githyanki have a racial pact with red dragons, who sometimes serve githyanki as steeds". "The Lich Queen's Beloved" mentions dragons serving githyanki ("Vraxanault a very old red dragon polymorphed into the form of a githyanki warlock, serves as the warlord's steed and military advisor."). </p>

<p>More importantly (and more fatal to your theory), the module also describes the Staff of Ephelomon, which has the power to dominate any red dragon within a half mile. If Ephelomon and Tiamat expected this to be an equal partnership, that sure is a strange way to show it -- by giving the other side the ability to mentally control their "allies".</p>

<p>So no, I'm not making up the fact that red dragons are said to "serve" the githyanki. They do indeed act as servants to the githyanki, sometimes against their free will. You can choose to disregard those references, but please don't say they don't exist. It's not a matter of opinion.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>I think it's more interesting to consider that an eons-old, mutually beneficial partnership was forcibly severed to the dismay of both dragons and githyanki.</div>
It may be more interesting, but that directly contradicts Dungeon 100. In the description of the Staff of Ephelomon, it states "If the scepter is destroyed, the pact between the red dragons and the githyanki dissolves. The red dragons do not immediately turn against the githyanki, but only the most subservient one continue to serve or assist the githyanki in any way. Red dragons in Vlaakith's service continue to serve the lich-queen, out of fear but not loyalty". It doesn't sound to me like any red dragons will be crying over that. The githyanki will be quite upset, however. If this were an alliance between friends, the staff would be merely symbolic. It isn't. </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Furthermore, I maintain my idea fits the published material better than yours, as outlined in the quotes above.</div>
We'll have to agree to disagree there. The source material consistently talk about red dragons serving, service, and servitude to the githyanki. This contradicts your theory. You've attempted to address that problem by insisting that references to "service" are poetic license, and that the githyanki "serve" the red dragons as much as the dragons serve them -- something that is never actually mentioned in any source material. That falls somewhere between being a stretch and being inplausible.</p>

<p>My theory, on the other hand, takes the source material at face value, warts and all. There is a pact, it is enforced from on high, and those personally gaining the least from it like it the least. If the pact ends, the red dragons aren't terribly interested in continuing to help the gitnhyanki at all. After referencing these things as stated in the source material, I simply conjectured as to WHY things are as described. If you're going to say that such an approach that entirely accepts the source material doesn't fit the source material, then I'm not sure what more to say. </p>

<p>Your ideas about the red dragon pact are interesting and they would open up all sorts of interesting possibilities. They appeal to the romantic in me. However, they also do deviate slightly from the published information. As such, I personally don't find them plausible as an answer to the questions raised here.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>I think the text implies they're forced by older dragons, not Tiamat. Certainly, the staff of Ephelomon mandates that <span style="font-style:italic">some</span> dragon comes to the githyanki's aid, but the fact that only the younger and weaker ones come indicates that the dragons are able to decide among themselves who it should be. </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div> absolutely do not think that, nor have I stated anything of the kind. I have correctly referred to the fact that the source material says that the red dragons "serve" the githyanki. A servant is not a slave. The terms are not interchangable. </div></p>

<p>That's true. A servant works willingly in exchange for a wage. A slave is forced to work by his master and is not fairly recompensed. You were describing slaves, not servants.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Nope. The 3E Manual of the Planes and the 3E Monster Manual both say "Githyanki have a racial pact with red dragons, who sometimes serve githyanki as steeds".

<p>The context above is more "to meet the requirements for" than it is "to be a servant of." As in, "this spoon will serve as a decent catapult" or "this car will serve as well as any." </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>More importantly (and more fatal to your theory), the module also describes the Staff of Ephelomon, which has the power to dominate any red dragon within a half mile.</div></p>

<p>That's rather beside the point, as only one person - Vlaakith - has the Staff at any time. The githyanki in general are equal partners with the dragons. Apparently Tiamat gifted the githyanki ruler with the ability to be more than that.</p>

<p>No, not fatal at all. Someone forced into servitude by magical compulsion is without doubt a slave, however. I'll not dispute that Vlaakith herself thinks of dragons as much less than friends or companions, but it's hard to imagine that she'd deal with them at all if she were forced to deal with them as equals as her knights do.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div> They do indeed act as servants to the githyanki, sometimes against their free will. </div></p>

<p>That would be a slave, not a servant.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the references don't seem to say what you think they do.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>It's not a matter of opinion.</div></p>

<p>I think there's room for interpretation; I'm not going to say you're out and out wrong. However, I think your interpretation is weak.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div> You've attempted to address that problem by insisting that references to "service" are poetic license</div></p>

<p>No, I'm insisting the word has many definitions, and you're choosing a rather unnatural one in order to force a point. My investment banker provides me with a "service," but isn't my servant. Someone at a restaraunt may serve me, but we're both benefitting from the transaction thanks to wages and tips.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>and that the githyanki "serve" the red dragons as much as the dragons serve them -- something that is never actually mentioned in any source material.</div></p>

<p>It says directly that the dragons are their friends and companions, which pretty much kills your idea that they're slaves serving despite their protests. A friend or companion is an equal. I'll agree that Dungeon #100 takes a somewhat harsher approach than Planescape did - but I always give Planescape priority.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I did make an error above: it's important to note that I am actually not pushing any alternative theory here. What I have done is simply go back to the source material and lay out what is well defined and is not well defined. I also posted some questions about what is not defined, and the many different ways in which it could be defined while still staying within the constraints of the existing source material. As far as listing the facts as documented, basically none of that is guesswork. Either the source material says something or it doesn't.</p>

<p>Therefore, for you to say that my "idea" is not as valid as yours makes it clear that you are missing what is happening here. You're alone in pushing any sort of "idea" here --  you have a very firm idea as to how you would answer the unanswered questions mentioned above regarding the mysteries of the red dragon pact. Personally, I don't have any strong feelings one way or the other on it. Instead, what I have done is to point out several logical problems with your suggested explanation. That should not be confused with me advocating a competing explanation. It is merely a factual analysis of the suggested answers you have put forward. And in this case, the factual analysis shows that your suggestions deviate from the material under discussion in significant ways, undermining the plausibility of your solution.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

          The disappearance (and return?) of Gith        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>A servant works willingly in exchange for a wage. A slave is forced to work by his master and is not fairly recompensed. You were describing slaves, not servants.</div>
I have specifically used the words "serve" and "servant".  The only one calling red dragons slaves is you. By misquoting me, you undermine your argument and do a disservice to the discussion. I also clearly said that the red dragons are paid. Using your criteria above, I was therefore describing servants, not slaves. So your statement above is also self-contradictory.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Someone forced into servitude by magical compulsion is without doubt a slave, however. I'll not dispute that Vlaakith herself thinks of dragons as much less than friends or companions, but it's hard to imagine that she'd deal with them at all if she were forced to deal with them as equals as her knights do. </div>
The staff was given to Vlaakith I, the legitimate and non-lich heir to Gith's throne. So, according to your own words, the successor to Gith was given the ability by Tiamat to treat any number of red dragons as slaves at her whim, a power that she is allowed to bequeath to her descendents for an unlimited aamount of time into the future. Please don't try to tell me that the average red dragon isn't deeply offended by that. It is important to note that the ability to remove their free will was provided to the githyanki by the red dragon's own deity. By doing this she has, to one degree or another, sold out her "people" in a fundamental way as part of the trade. And she has most certainly set up nothing resembling a friendly alliance between her magically brainwashed followers and the brainwashers in question.</p>

<p>Individual red dragons and githyanki may form friendships on occasion. That proves nothing about the nature of the relative relational dynamics.  Servants and employers form friendships, as do slaves and masters. Friendship and servitude are not mutually exclusive. </p>

<p>Even the 2E Planescape material which you are now falling back on clearly states that the dragons who serve are at times "compelled" and "forced". Who or what compels and forces them is irrelevant. As long we all agree that compulsion is present, even if only in some cases, then your theory of a voluntary alliance between peers is  shown to be contradicted by the same Planescape sources you're quoting. Tiamat is allowing her 'people' to be used as automatons, and that is about as far from "friendly alliance" as you get.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Yes, but "slave" is a better word for what you're describing. I'm not sure how you can dispute that someone forced to labor for someone against their will is anything else.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Please don't try to tell me that the average red dragon isn't deeply offended by that. </div></p>

<p>The average red dragon doesn't know about it. The amount of red dragons Vlaakith is going to be able to bind is comparatively miniscule compared to the amount who have friendly relations with the githyanki.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>By doing this she has, to one degree or another, sold out her "people" in a fundamental way as part of the trade.</div></p>

<p>Sure, but not to the degree you were describing. The vast majority of relations between dragons and githyanki are on an equal basis.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div> Friendship and servitude are not mutually exclusive. </div></p>

<p>I would argue that it is. Someone forced to obey your will is not your friend, regardless of how you have both deluded yourself. That's not something friends do. As prideful as we've both agreed red dragons are, they're not going to want to be "friends" with anyone who's shown they have power over them or forced them to do what they don't want to do.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Who or what compels and forces them is irrelevant. </div></p>

<p>Not really - who compels them makes all the difference in who they focus their anger on. If the githyanki force them to do things (though their queen's possession of a magic staff) then friendship is impossible.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Tiamat is allowing her 'people' to be used as automatons, and that is about as far from "friendly alliance" as you get.</div></p>

<p>That <span style="font-style:italic">would</span> be far from a friendly alliance - since a friendly alliance is the relationship that is described, it cannot be the case, excepting, I'm willing to allow, in the sole exception of those relatively few dragons forced to serve Vlaakith directly.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;Invisig0th&#039;</em> wrote:</div>I can see now that you have no interest in an honest, open discussion of your ideas, or in revising your opinions in light of new information.</div></p>

<p>I seem to have enraged you, and for that I apologize. I've been trying very hard to keep our disagreements amicable, but I seem to have failed miserably. Although I seem to have become a dark force of Message Board Evil in your eyes, rest assured that I hold you in no ill regard.

<p>I have no desire to insult you or to be your Internet Enemy. However, my view is my honest opinion and I've supported it with documentation. I believe the same is true for you. However, you are unwilling to admit that there is ambiguity in the sources you site, while I am not. I do maintain that my view better fits the evidence as a whole. I disagree with you in this one minor issue, but I hope this won't color your opinion of future posts I make.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

Let's ponder that statement for a second, because it highlights exactly what I'm dealing with here. </p>

<p>According to the definition of the term "slave" that you have clearly stated above, someone who gets drafted into the army is a slave, since they are "someone forced to labor for someone against their will". They are, according to your own definition above, an honest-to-god slave in the same sense of the word used to refer to black slaves in early America. </p>

<p>I think we can all agree that this is an absolutely preposterous assertion.  I mean, seriously, you've been trying to shove the word "slave" into my mouth for, what, the past 4 posts?  Only to now misuse that term yourself? Come on. So no, slave is demonstrably *not* an applicable term for what I am describing. You're mistaken.  Red dragons are described as both conscripts and servants. I wouldn't (and didn't) call them slaves. There's no point in pretending I did so.</p>

<p>Based on your abuse of this word here, it could be argued that you demonstrate behavior indicating that dictionary definitions are also "open to interpretation" and easily discarded if found to be inconvenient. I'm afraid I disagree. That being the case, I'm sure you'll understand why I will politely be declining to discuss anything with you in the future. You can't have any sort of meaningful discussion if one of the two parties is consistently abusing and redefining the underlying terms and facts that are the basis for the discussion to suit their own whims. You also cannot have such a debate if a person gets caught making an utterly perposterous statement and then ignores that fact. I'm sorry to say that you've actually done this several times now.</p>

<p>Have a nice day, and best of luck to you. If nothing else, I can say that you've been fairly cordial, and that counts for something. No hard feelings.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

          The disappearance (and return?) of Gith        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;Invisig0th&#039;</em> wrote:</div>According to the definition of the term "slave" that you have clearly stated above, someone who gets drafted into the army is a slave, since they are "someone forced to labor for someone against their will". They are, according to your own definition above, an honest-to-god slave in the same sense of the word used to refer to black slaves in early America. </div></p>

<p>Whether or not I think conscripted soldiers can be considered slaves is beside the point (for the record, I think they can be; their lives are, at least temporarily, no longer their own). We're talking about using magic to take control of a sapient being's mind, which is an order of magnitude worse.</p>

<p>Just as comparing conscripted soldiers to people made the property of another for life seems extreme, comparing them to dragons who are magically compelled to fight for "lesser races" against their will is also a bad comparison - but in all three cases, the difference is one of degree, not in type. Yes, it's better to be enslaved temporarily than it is to be enslaved permanently. Perhaps it's better to be a $1000 a night prostitute than a $5 a night prostitute. But it's still slavery, and it's not something that friends do to friends.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>I wouldn't (and didn't) call them slaves. There's no point in pretending I did so.</div></p>

<p>I never claimed you called them slaves. That is, however, what you described, and there seems little point in claiming otherwise. If you abduct someone at gunpoint and force them to clean your house you've enslaved them - you can call them a servant, as that word is accurate as well, but the uglier word is more appropriate. If you abduct someone at gunpoint and force them to carry you around on your back or fight your battles they are no less a slave, no matter how you pretty it up with words.</p>

<p>Regardless of whether you call them slaves or servants, they're not your friends.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div> You can't have any sort of meaningful discussion if one of the two parties is consistently abusing and redefining the underlying terms</div></p>

<p>I don't feel I've done that. I think I'm being honest with words, calling a spade a spade. I refuse to try to turn an argument about dragons on the internet into a moral crusade, where one person has to be a dishonest dissembler and the other is a defender of truth. It's enormously tempting for me to think of you in the same terms as you apparently think of me, but I can see the world from your point of view, even if I don't agree with it, and I know you think you're the good guy here.</p>

<p>I would suggest that, in the future, if you wish to have cordial debates with others, that you refrain from impugning your opponent's character, as not everyone is as willing to ignore it as I currently am. You've made this much uglier than it needed to be, and if I weren't trying so hard to be polite it could have been a flame war.</p>

<p>We're talking about <span style="font-style:italic">dragons</span>, for God's sake.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;ripvanwormer&#039;</em> wrote:</div>I've always been fond of my theory, that Tiamat gave Gith to the highest bidder, entity who wanted her the most - Ilsensine, whose thirst for vengeance against the woman who destroyed the illithid empire ran deep. Ilsensine, in return, gave Tiamat the sort of payment a greater god can give - an entire world, perhaps, or another major sphere of influence. The death of a rival. Something pretty that she can wear at clubs.</div></p>

<p>I've always thought it was implied in the story of Vlaakith's acendence that she somehow double crossed her leader, selling Gith to Tiamat in return for the throne and the service of the Red Dragons.  </p>

<p>I've never, however, managed to figure out <span style="font-style:italic">why</span> Gith was worth so much to Tiamat.  Rip's theory pulls it all together for me.  <span style="font-style:italic">Of Course</span> Ilsensine wanted Gith; when Gith broke the Ilithid Empire she delt It a more terible blow than perhaps any mortal ever has.  In fact, she came D*mn close to killing It; only the Two Skys stopped her from exterminating the Ilithid race.  As long as Gith was around, she was a potential threat to It.</p>

<p>So; Tiamat gets to trade Gith to Ilsensine (a detail which Vlaakith may or may not have been aware), Vlaakith gets the throne, and the Githyanki get the powerful Red Dragons as allies.</p>

<p>It also occurs to me that the service of the Red Dragons to the Gith may also have been something that Tiamat found desireable.  Consider:  the Red Dragons are Tiamat's most powerful children, but they have also strayed from the fold.  Tiamat, a Lawful diety, may have been hoping that forcing the Chaotic Red Dragons to abide by a contract and cooperate with another race would make them more Lawful.  This would explain why she would grant Vlaakith the ability to enforce the Pact, why the Pact made the Reds the slight inferiors of the Githyanki, and why the Reds do not wish to continue to work with the Githyanki once the Pact is broken.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

          The disappearance (and return?) of Gith        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>I had an Idea about the Staff of E. It goes something like this:</p>

<p>Githyanki and Red Dragons form an alliance. Red Dragons fly Gith around in return for X. (I don't know what X is. Thats up to greater thinkers then I.)</p>

<p>Now, what happens in the event of a member (or small group) of either side of the Bargin breaking their agreement and going to town on the other side. <br />
(Egotistical Red Dragons eating the Gith who would dare think to treat them as rides, or Xenophobic Gith who go Dragon hunting).</p>

<p>It has already been stated that the Gith are (in most cases) weaker then the Red Dragons. Especially with the level 16 soul buffet. So, if any of the Gith go looking for a fight, they get eaten by the Red Dragons and the problem ends quickly. Unless the Gith decide to attack in mass, and in that case Tiamat would conisder Vlaakith to have a lot of explaining to do.</p>

<p>On the other way around, if a singel/ small group of red dragon/s decides to go Gith Hunting, this becomes a HUGE problem for the Gith. A singel Great Wyrm Red Dragon is CR 26. Thats 10 levels higher then the Gith are allowed to get.</p>

<p>Could Gith and Tiamat forsee the paranoid actions of our lovable undead Vlaakith oh so long ago? Probably not. But the differance in power would have to be addressed. </p>

<p>So, the Staff of E. was part of Giths reqirment in the bargin. And she might have had to throw herself into the bargin to get it. In the event of a powerful enough Red dragon breaching the pact and (for one reason or another) Tiamat not doing anything about it, the Gith would have a last ditch means of neutralizing the red Dragon threat without killing it. After all, a dead Red Dragon is a Red dragon no longer pumping Tiamat with sweet, sweet worship.</p>

<p>This would also explain why the Pact falls apart after the staff is destroyed.  In order to keep the Red Dragon from harming any Gith without killing it, the Dragon would have to stay within the power of the staff. That ends up as mental domination for all eternity. Got to love that timeless immortality. </p>

<p>Now, I don't know about you, but I think that the prospect of un-ending mental domination if you put up too much of a fight is enough of a reason for the Red Dragons to grumble a bit, but do as their told. They don't like it, but what can they do? Their God wants them to do it, and if they dont they end up worse then dead. </p>

<p>As soon as the Staff is gone, so it their reason not to go to town on the Githyanki.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Could Gith/Vlaakith’s pact involved committing the souls of the Githyanki people to Tiamat? I also like the twist that Rip threw in about Gith being given to Ilsensine – it sounds like something a Baatorian power would do.<br />
Now- when the lich queen begins taking the souls of the most powerful of the Githyanki that starts to rub Tiamat the wrong way but she’s still bound by the pact which technically hasn’t been broken because this soul draining happens to living Githyanki. However this does mean that once there is an opening Tiamat will jump on the opportunity to take a bit of revenge on the race which has been screwing her over for the past 1000 years or so. </p>

<p>I can see a few flaws with this theory but I like the idea of the pact involving Githyanki souls- it explains why deity worship is so discouraged- it jeopardises the pact, and why Tiamat was willing to trade the services of the dragons- she reaped a huge reward in the souls of an entire race. </p>

<p>Critique at will</div><br />
I like it, though the creation of the Duth'Ka'Gith is problematic if Tiamat has gotten "stiffed" by the Lich-Queen's rise. If Tiamat was feeling like she'd been getting short-changed with no new influx of souls, it's unlikely that she'd sanction the creation of half-dragon gith warriors.</p>

<p>The problem with this conundrum is that the simplest explanations don't stand the "test of time."</p>

<p>I used to wonder if perhaps Tiamat agreed to the bargain for a short-term gain. After all, the chances of the newly-freed githyanki surviving in the Astral for very long was a long shot. So Tiamat struck an accord to gain something in the short term, assuming the githyanki would soon scatter to the Astral winds and free her from any oaths or alliances. Instead, the githyanki flourished. But that idea also suffers from the pitfall that Tiamat would come to resent the alliance, giving her no reason to cooperate further down the road, and meeting her end of the bargain with only the bare minimum.</p>

<p>But that's not what happened. Instead, Tiamat and Ephelemon seem perfectly pleased with whatever they're getting from the alliance. Enough, anyway, that they assisted (or at least permitted) with the creation of the Duth'Ka'Gith and have never (to our knowledge) tried to break the alliance.</p>

<p>So, the question of gain becomes the only question we can't answer. Clearly, the githyanki have gained substantially from the alliance. What have the red dragons gained?</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

          The disappearance (and return?) of Gith        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;Azriael&#039;</em> wrote:</div>I just had a thought and I haven't researched it too much so it could be full of it but- </p>

<p>Where do Githyanki souls go? They're basically an athiest culture so probably to their plane of alignment (or possibly to Asmodeus if you believe some sources). <br />
</div></p>

<p>I think that officially, an otherwise unclaimed githyanki soul goes to the Outer Plane of appropriate alignment (usually a Lower Plane).  Those of very high-level githyanki generally ended up being added to Vlaakith's huge collection of captured souls in the Palace of Whispers (and, in scenarios where the Revered Queen is dead, were freed and went to their alignment planes).  It seems likely that many githyanki knights (particularly those of high level and unusual renown) were transformed into tla'ikiths (undead sword spirits) and commanded to guard locations of particular importance.  Let us not also forget that, in the reign of the most recent Vlaakith, undeath is probably not seen all that undesirable, probably because undead are generally <span style="font-style:italic">totally immune to telepathic influence</span>.  Given that illithids are Enemy #1 to them that's a big deal.</p>

<p>However, the "go to the Outer Plane of appropriate alignment" explanation bothers me.  Especially since one of the themes of Planescape is that belief shapes reality.  The Outer Planes, as far as we know, do not occupy any special place in the githyanki belief system.  At least to me, it just doesn't seem to... fit.  I think a gith would be quite upset at the notion that, after a lifetime of service to the Revered Queen, working toward the utter annihilation of the illithid race, and the concept of liberty as githyanki understand it, his reward would be an anonymous damnation for eternity alongside the souls of inferior barbarian races.  </p>

<p>While there's a certain ironic value in that, it casts the githyanki as colossal dupes.  By comparison, the drow <span style="font-style:italic">know</span> they're evil and they absolutely revel in it.  They also have access to a very non-anonymous afterlife in the form of Lolth's plane (or dimension of the Abyss depending on which cosmology you're using).  Going to the Demonweb is <span style="font-style:italic">desirable</span> to them.  </p>

<p>The big problem here is the premise that a true deity is necessary for a race to have a... culturally appropriate afterlife.  If we wish to deviate from canon, here are some ideas:</p>

<p>Personally, I like reincarnation.  A githyanki soul reincarnates endlessly (as a githyanki, of course, the only 'pure' race) until it either is taken up by the Revered Queen (perceived as a very desirable state) and either added to the Palace of Whispers or transformed into some kind of undead entity, or it totally screws up (goes renegade).  </p>

<p>If the githyanki have a concept of hell, it would almost certainly be an afterlife-model of an illithid city, complete with an eternity of repeated brain extraction, forced gladiatorial combat, being forced to feed on the corpses of other thralls, and other unspeakable horrors.  Given their history of enthrallment, I'm sure the githyanki have very detailed notions of what eternal punishment would be like.</p>

<p>To me, this seems far more realistic than ending up in the realm of, say, Mephistopheles.  Should an entire race in a Planescape setting end up in a version of Hell that has little to no place in their own belief system?</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

The Revered Queen in that case simply co-opted the existing belief system for her own purposes.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>What about this?</p>

<p>Gith is the reason githyanki are evil. Not even because she stirred the fervor and thirst for blood and forged them into a ruthless army. Well, because of that but also because of the deal she made with Tiamat. Gith signed over the soul of all who swear to her name to Baator. Githyanki souls, once they are indoctrinated into the Astral culture, are damned to the Nine Hells. This dark brand on their souls has led to an innate disposition to evil. But Vlaakith found a way to save her people. By taking those souls into herself, she, as matriarch of the race, also becomes the path to salvation. The Revered Lich Queen is there to pull souls off the path to ruin.</p>

<p>(Ideally, I think this concept would work better if Vlaakith could do it for all githyanki souls. That would motivate them toward some hefty devotion on the part of the githyanki.)</p>

<p>Of course, this hasn't gotten around very far among the githyanki. But now with the pact broken, githyanki souls are freed. What does that do?</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

          The disappearance (and return?) of Gith        </div>

         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;Azure&#039;</em> wrote:</div>
I favor githyanki reincarnation as well.  In fact, it makes sense to me that somehow the pact kept Gith's soul from coming back, somehow.  Surely the soul of the most powerful psion the mutiverse has ever known served Tiamat well over the centuries.</div></p>

<p>Aside from being an awesome psion, the Liberator is probably the one mortal NPC in the entire multiverse who has, as an individual, had the most impact on said multiverse.  That alone would make her soul worth quite a bit on the market.  </p>

<p>As for the Tiamat angle, I wouldn't say the Revered Queen is in any way interested in the salvation of the githyanki -- especially since she planned to turn many of them (or even ALL of them) into half-red-dragons, who would become champions of her new order.  The duthka'giths, especially, make me think she wasn't interested in messing with the red dragon pact.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">
