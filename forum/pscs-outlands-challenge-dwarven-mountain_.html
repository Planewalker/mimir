</div> <p>The second thread of our ongoing Outlands exploration...</p>

<p>In a simular vein as <a href="forum_.html" class="bb-url"> the Tir thread</a></p>

<p>I'd like to gather up some information on Dwarven Mountain. Not just the information on the three powers of the place, but also information on the local traders, the plots and intrigues that are ongoing there. Things GMs can use as plot hooks. NPCs they can use... etc.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">What we know:</span><br />
1) The <a href="encyclopedia/node/_.html" class="bb-url">Encyclopedia entry for the Mountain</a><br />
2) And for <a href="encyclopedia/node/_.html" class="bb-url">Ironridge</a> a nearby trading partner.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">What we need to know:</span><br />
1) Primary NPCs<br />
2) Adventure hooks in the area<br />
3) Organized groups, politics, post-FW changes<br />
4) History for the three major parts</p>

<p>Again, there's many thanks and a credits line in a PSCS release in it for ya. <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/smile.png" title="Smiling" alt="Smiling" class="smiley-content"/></p>       </div>

         <p>Both.</p>

<p>We usually start a project off by pulling together what we already know from canon - usually the Encyclopedia entries will do, though anything that's not covered in those that folks know anything about - it'd be nice to have mentioned. That way we don't contradict ourselves. <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/wink.png" title="Eye-wink" alt="Eye-wink" class="smiley-content"/></p>

<p>Then we get into making things up, riffing off each other and canon to produce new material, more in-depth materials and other such nifty information for DMs and Players alike.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>This is purely on my behalf and there's not much connected to it at the moment, but it suddenly strikes me that Vergadain's gambling halls could host a small contingent of Ring-Givers from nearby Ysgard.  There are a couple of interesting ways in which the gambler's mindset of risk, loss, and payoff interplays with the Ring-Giver's philosophies of giving and receiving.</p>

<p>Brainstorming:</p>

<p>(1) Philosophically, a dedicated Ring-Giver is sure that what he gives away, he'll get back, and more.  How does that compare to risking something in a game?  You're not giving it away; you're essentially paying it for the uncertain opportunity to get more back.  It's almost the opposite of the Ring-Givers.  Do they go around preaching against gambling?  In that case, they wouldn't be welcome in Vergadain's halls, but they might be able to stay in Brightmantle's.  On the other hand, they might be accepting of it, since giving to get is what they believe in.  This flavor of Ring-Giver would be philosophically very interested in the ramifications of gambling and how it furthers the cycles of giving.  The Ring-Givers here (a sort of Ring-Giver monastery, or pilgrimage site?) might be pretty accomplished gamblers themselves, or poverty-stricken gamblers, or, somehow, both.  (Or a mix of the two types, as pilgrims come and go.)</p>

<p>(2) A berk can lose some valuable traits in Vergadain's halls.  This makes the interesting opportunity for a Ring-Giver to fulfill a unique and deep need.  Perhaps they often have a way of giving something he's lost back to a gambler, in return for an even deeper payment later (somehow they always seem to be owed a favor by someone who can collect the loss on an old debt, or they have their own mysterious ways of simply transferring valuables like a destiny or a level, or maybe they're simply really good at negotiating good value to the petitioner who won the bet, though sometimes, of course, the winner isn't going to give it up).  When this loss is something like a cherished memory, or a famous reputation, or something strange like that, you can bet the payment later will be the stuff of legends.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I want to contribute something here, but I'm afraid my expertise is with the Dwarves of Kyrnn.  Based on the fact that Reorx's forge is located in Arcadia, would it be inappropriate to attribute Kyrnnish concepts to the "Dwarven Mountain"?  If so I have a couple of ideas I could write up:</p>

<p>--A warren of gully dwarves in the confines of the Soot Hall.  Unlike the gully dwarves of Ansalon though, I imagine these ones having a purpose, perhaps breeding and raising urkhan worms.  These creatures are large earthworms bred for tunneling and riding.     <br />
--A village in the hills near the "Dwarven Mountains" for dwarf petitioners who are exiled or clanless.  These dwarves aren't evil or betrayers, they've simply lost their honor due to politics and family sins.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Ulaa's realm, the Iron Hills, should be nearby. Ulaa's a goddess worshiped by dwarves, gnomes, and humans on the world of Oerth - physically, she resembles a dwarf with gnomish features.

         <p>Ironridge is pop. 500, mostly petitioners with a few planars and primes. They're nearly all of human origin, too, there to trade or desperate gamblers hoping for a chance at Vergadain's wheels. The two NPCs described are a dwarf and a bariaur, however. </p>

<p>What would petitioners who don't worship the dwarf gods be doing there?  Mostly to trade - probably most are neutral souls unaffiliated with any deity, but there might be some from the Marketplace Eternal, or devotees of the Egyptian god Bes (who is on good terms with, and might even be an aspect of, Vergadain).</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Demihuman Deities</span> calls the realm "Dwarvish Mountain" for some reason. </p>

<p>The gems in Dumathoin's realm are extremely sacred to the local petitioners, used to bring them to oneness with the realm. There's an illicit trade of these gems that eventually reaches the shadow fiends, thanks to Tarholt of Sigil - the petitioners would be <span style="font-style:italic">furious</span> to find out about this - he's essentially denying them their eternity for money, so that the shadow fiends can deny the eternities of others.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Sigil and Beyond</span> briefly describes several NPCs from Ironridge and the Mountain: Sedrus Backbreaker (fighter 10 male dwarf, Mercykiller), Melias Fairherd (wizard 7 female bariaur, Society of Sensation); Lzuli Clearfacet (male einheriar bouncer of Vergadain) and his translator; Pyrus Chertchip (male petitioner of Dugmaren Brightmantle); and Steelblade (a male dwarven petitioner brainwashed by Ilsensine).</p>

<p>The key, I think, is to remember that this is the dwarven <span style="font-style:italic">afterlife</span> - it's Heaven for dwarves who worship those three gods, and probably for most neutral dwarves who don't worship any gods in particular. Perhaps there are petitioners there who have existed in the realm for tens of thousands of years, stubbornly refusing to merge with their deity or the realm. Perhaps some of them originally worshiped older dwarf gods that don't exist anymore, gods that thrived before the current generation of dwarven gods was even born. There might be other beings who preceded the dwarves - as hinted at above in Ulaa's description - alien creatures who claimed the mountain before the dwarven species came to power, creatures whose gods and civilization are long-dead. </p>

<p>"Welcome to eternity. Here's your shovel. Get to work." - A dwarven petitioner, to a new arrival.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

          Dwarven Mountain - Getting There        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>"How much further to Dwarven Mountain?" asked Rama.  He was a tall, dark-skinned man from the Prime land of Ind. </p>

<p>"Don't call it that here," said Melias Fairherd, a hulking bariaur doe. "You'll advertise your cluelessness. It's <span style="font-style:italic">Dwurmar</span>, like the dwarves themselves call it." </p>

<p>"They call it Dwarven Mountain in Sigil," said Rama.</p>

<p>"You think Sigilians can't be clueless? They are more often than not, believe me, particularly about dwarves. Even in Sigil the dwarven community keeps itself buried and isolated. In the Outlands, in the home of their gods, they're even worse. They think it's blasphemous to mingle too much with other races while their gods are looking over their shoulders. It's best, then, to humor them while you're on their holy ground. Call the realm Dwurmar. It means the same thing, roughly - it signifies that it's a dwarven mountain, a <span style="font-style:italic">mardwurin</span>, but also that it's a dwarf mountain, a mountain that's at the same time a living dwarf. They say that Dwurmar represents the body of the dwarven race, and <span style="font-style:italic">Tormar</span> - that's the mountain in Celestia, also called Erackinor for other reasons, equally valid - represents the dwarven soul. Nyrmar - called Mount Clangeddin by humans - represents the dwarf's good strong axe-hand.</p>

<p>"To answer your question, though, it'll be a while yet. Getting to Dwurmar means traveling the same path that dwarven souls travel. That means first we have to reach Telmar and Ysmar, the mountains of fire and ice. Every dwarf soul appears in the valley between them soon after death. Telmar is passion and violence, impetuousness, while Ysmar is cold precision and solitude. Only a narrow path exactly between the two can lead to Dwurmar; every other path leads either to a volcano or a glacier, filled with the souls of those dwarves who've failed to reach their true afterlife, at least so far. Normally they unriddle the path eventually, or one of the dwarven gods from other planes comes to rescue them and take them somewhere more appropriate. Finding the path involves not just a physical search, but balancing the appropriate aspects of your own personality, or at least balancing those traits within your party."</p>

<p>Here she glanced at Rama and his companions, Gasar, Aeson, and Blodwyn, each as different from one another as they could be. They might be able to manage it, if they can arrange one another properly.</p>

<p>"The Outlands in general are about balance, of course," she continued. "And the gods who choose to dwell here prefer to leave those who tend to extremes elsewhere. If we hit the right path, it'll be another 3-18 days before we reach Dwurmar. Distance is a funny thing in the Land, so we can't hope to get more exact than that."</p>

<p>"There's no other path?" asked Blodwyn, a young human woman with dark hair and a sturdy suit of armor.</p>

<p>"No," said Melias. "Telmar and Ysmar are <span style="font-style:italic">always</span> in front of Dwurmar, no matter what direction you approach from. Except underneath, that is, but underneath Dwurmar are the Caverns of Thought, where Ilsensine lurks. You really don't want to go there."</p>

<p>"How will we know we're on the right path?" asked Rama.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's easy. You'll see the River Gloin, which springs from the point where the ice of Ysmar is melted by the ash of Telmar. The local mythology says it came originally from the blood of a dwarven hero, also named Gloin, a petitioner whose true home should have been in Ysgard. Nonetheless, out of loyalty toward his god and people, he remained in Dwurmar, and even died defending it from an incursion by minions of the beholder god Gzemnid. The river flows to Glorium and the fjord that leads to Ysgard, as Gloin's spirit wished to go in life. As a way of honoring Gloin's sacrifice, or something of the sort, dwarven petitioners are permitted to boat down the river to Glorium if they wish, to make it easier to escape if they're truly not content there. Many choose to stay, though, to defend the realm as Gloin did. At Glorium, the river splits, and an offshoot called the River Alf flows to the River Oceanus and the Upper Planes, so the choice that Gloin created has split into still more options. Most planewalkers don't care what dwarf petitioners do, of course - they just appreciate what the rivers do to aid travel and trade. Some see the hand of Muamman Duathal, dwarven god of travel, in this. You can still follow the River Gloin upstream forever without reaching Dwurmar, unless you reach the same balance everyone else has. </p>

<p>"Once you have, it's different for each group. Some see a bridge, some a boat, and some a ford where they have to wade across to reach Dwurmar.  A few see something more exotic, like an airship or even a dragon. They're all the same thing, just seen in different ways. You're encountering an <span style="font-style:italic">idea</span>, the threshold of transition between outside of the realm and within it. If you people can't control yourselves and your party doesn't balance itself exactly, we'll have to wait until we can find another group of travelers that counters  your imbalance. Fortunately, opposites tend to attract in the Land, so these things have a way of working themselves out.</p>

<p>"Getting out of the realm is much easier. The gods don't care much about testing those going elsewhere, so you won't see Ysmar and Telmar on the way out. You might see the river, though. You can exit the realm via the River Gloin, heading toward Glorium, or you can go further into the mountains. The dwarves call this range the <span style="font-style:italic">Tordur</span>, or Soulshield, because it protects them from neighboring realms. One of the nearest the realm of the goliath deities - they're a pantheon that watches over a race of prime giants. The bariaurs get along well with them, as do the dwarves when they're willing to admit it. They can be found 3-18 days Spireward from Dwurmar. About the same distance, toward Excelsior, are the Steel Hills, where the goddess Ulaa rules. Her husband Bleredd is often found there too, arriving with a crowd of petitioners and proxies to celebrate the couple's reunion."</p>

<p>She turned back to the party she was shepherding. "Any questions?" They stared back at her, their poor human brains doubtless suffering from information overload. "Good," said Melias. "Remember, concentrate on being passionate but not too passionate, cold and exact but not too much of that either. Seek a balance - observe the changes in the Land, feel the nature of the Land within you. Use your sight and vision, your nose and tongue. The Land will guide you if you let it."</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Strongale Hall</span></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">The Eternal Casino:</span> The Eternal Casino is the most famous and profitable of Strongale Hall's many gambling houses. There are roulette wheels, card games, clockwork slot machines and more, and it's possible to gamble away or to win literally anything imaginable - desperate sods wager their shadows, their souls, their intelligence or strength, their masculinity or femininity, even their divinity. Some just wager jink, and perhaps those are the wisest, if any of the addicts who dwell here can be considered wise.</p>

<p>The Eternal Casino is built like a luxurious palace, entirely beneath the earth, with the walls lined with garish precious metals and gems, fountains flowing with alcoholic beverages, and attractive male and female dwarves attending to a guest's every need - as long as he continues to gamble.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">The Infinite Casino:</span> The Infinite Casino is a newer construction, built only a few centuries ago with the intention of creating a rival to the Eternal Casino.  The Eternal Casino is certainly vast, but the Infinite Casino is literally unending; a basher can travel as far as she wants and never find a place where the rows of tables and gambling devices end. The petitioners who founded the place made bargains with the petitioners of Soot Hall to devise a way to endlessly replicate the same room over and over again, mysteriously allowing different groups to inhabit the copied rooms without overlapping with those in the others - yet it remains the same room, as anyone who closely examines the scars on the tables or the stains in the carpet will discover. The Infinite Casino offers most of the same services as the Eternal Casino, and it's luxurious and glamorous in its way, but something about its repetitiveness wears at a basher after a while. What happens to rooms when no one is in them is an open question, one some have standing bets on - do they disappear, or do they continue to exist, an infinite sequence of empty rooms extending forever?</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">The First Casino:</span> It's seen better times, that's for sure, but this establishment has the distinction of being the very first casino opened in Strongale Hall, countless millennia ago when Vergadain was a young deity. It shows - the First Casino lacks the splashy advertisements and master craftsmanship of the Infinite and Eternal Casinos - it's a primitive, even neolithic cavern covered in crude carvings and proto-dwarvish runes. It's still used by some of the older petitioners and those with old-fashioned tastes, but the petitioners who run it have obdurately resisted redecorating it with more modern luxuries.</p>

<p>There are rumors that the First Casino originally served some other purpose before Vergadain claimed this realm, and that older, virtually dead gods still maintain some kind of presence within the wall carvings, subtly guiding the movement of the sticks, the colored stones and bone dice that make or break the patrons here.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">The Last Casino:</span> Much older than the Infinite Casino, the Last Casino is named not for its age but for its status as a "last chance" for those who are no longer welcome in any other casinos in the realm. The Last Casino has the worst odds and the least friendly staff of all the realm's casinos, but people continue to patronize it out of sheer desperation. The Last Casino permits more extreme betting than the other casinos, too - a berk can gamble away not just pieces of their talents or souls, but their whole existences all at once, or even the existences of their servants and family. The staff lacks the professional or personal ethics of the other casinos, and their punishments for those who default on their bets can be hideous.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Hall of Indebted Souls:</span> Most of those left with debts they cannot pay are imprisoned here, in the Hall of Indebted Souls, to work off what they owe until their creditors are satisfied. Debtors are often transformed into the shapes their employers find most convenient - often dwarves, but also pack animals or even inanimate objects. </p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">The Hall's Edge Saloon:</span> One of countless alehalls in the realm, The Hall's Edge Saloon has the distinction of being the tavern nearest the shaft  leading to Soot Hall. Travelers and petitioners from both realms often frequent it, engineers and craftsfolk devoted to Dugmaren Brightmantle fraternizing with merchants and rogues worshipping Vergadain. Here, deals are made and celebrated.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Hanseath's realm:</span> Hanseath, god of alcohol, carousing, and warfare, may seem more suited for Ysgard than the Outlands, but he fits in perfectly with the raucas atmosphere of Strongale Hall and couldn't imagine dwelling anywhere else. Hanseath's petitioners are often battleragers and berserkers, and can cause trouble in those taverns frequented also by Vergadain's faithful, as well as occasionally tearing up sections of casinos. Hanseath himself makes sure to pay for his followers' mistakes, but some followers of Vergadain wish that Hanseath would go to Ysgard and leave them alone. Still, Hanseath is a valued member of the Morndinsamman, and for every Vergadainite who complains there's one who enjoys nothing more than to share a drink with a fun-loving follower of Hanseath.</p>

<p>Hanseath's petitioners often travel to other planes to battle orcs, goblins, and giant-kin. They have a rivalry of sorts with the warriors of Clangeddin Silverbeard in Arcadia, and can sometimes be seen in gate-towns and Sigil arguing drunkenly with Clangeddin's stern soldiers.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Diinkarazan's former realm:</span> Before his banishment, the dwarven god of madness dwelled in Strongale Hall. In those days he was considered merely eccentric, a quirky godling fond of socializing, often seen in the company of his older and cleverer brother Diirinka. After Diirinka betrayed him to Ilsensine, Diinkarazan's tiny hall was left abandoned, his few petitioners without a patron. Still, Diinkarazan is not dead, and he continues to exert some influence over it. Diinkarazan's realm is a horrific place tainted by the tortured insanity of its master, full of terrible visions and demonic vestiges. It is carefully avoided by the wise, though some have tried to hide here to avoid debt collectors. Occasionally debt collectors will hire adventurers from outside the mountain to capture those so foolish, or to capture what's left of them.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><span style="font-style:italic">Vergadain's palace: </span>This is the seat of Vergadain's power, the place where his most powerful aspect sits on a seat of gold and judges his faithful. Gambling is encouraged here, but solely as a private matter between individuals - those who want more are encouraged to travel to one of the casinos created by his petitioners elsewhere in Strongale Hall. </p>

<p>It's not uncommon for servants of other merchant gods - Zilchus and Mouqol of Oerth, Waukeen of Toril, Bes of the Egyptians, Sera of Aebrynis, even Vergadain's brother Abbathor - as well as the mercane, Merkhants, the Fated, the Planar Trade Consortium, and others to come to Vergadain's palace in attempt to make bargains with the god's proxies, or even the god himself. Vergadain actually encourages this, as every such transaction empowers him. </p>

<p>By far, Vergadain's palace is the richest and most beautiful hall in Dwarven Mountain; the gambling halls look pale and tacky compared to it. Vergadain's capital is a work of art, perfectly planned and deliciously executed in every way, all precious metals, fine silks, and enormous, perfectly cut gemstones. Many of the raw materials come from Deepshaft Mine, but they come from all over the multiverse, from the Golden Hills to the Quasielemental Plane of Mineral to the far-off stars and planetoids of the Material Plane, even the depths of the Gray Waste and the Nine Hells. Vergadain loves to trade, and loves to show off his skill in doing so.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Adventure hooks in Strongale Hall:</p>

<p>- A mercantile group hostile to the PCs, such as the Planar Trade Consortium, baatezu servants of Dispater, or the tso, have come to Vergadain's palace to gain an exclusive contract with the god. The PCs follow them there in order to outbid them or otherwise destroy their credibility or bodies before they can do so. Perhaps they'll get the contract instead, or perhaps they'll be satisfied just making their enemies suffer. Perhaps they'll save a world or nation from exploitation in the process.</p>

<p>- A contact of the PCs has been imprisoned in the Hall of Indebted Souls, and the PCs need to bargain for a way to get that contact free if they're to learn important information from him/her, or to pay that contact back for a previous favor. </p>

<p>- A Sensate takes the PCs to Strongale Hall (through a temporary portal in Sigil) for a night of gambling and debauchery. They may just amuse themselves gambling what they can afford, or they may end up in trouble with the local authorities. Maybe their portal will shift or close unexpectedly, and they'll be forced to get back to the City of Doors the long way, traveling through Gzemnid's realm to Glorium, and from there to Rowan's Hall in Ysgard and thence to the Hall of Records.</p>

<p>- The PCs are hired (perhaps to help pay their debts or another's) to chase down debtors hiding first among the berserkers of Hanseath's hall, and finally in the maddening ruins of Diinkarazan's home. </p>

<p>- Someone in Sigil or elsewhere has a craving for fine dwarven ale, and sends the PCs to collect the finest dwarven ale in the multiverse. In one of Strongale Hall's many breweries, the petitioners are having trouble with an infestation of mischievous fey, or one of the batches is contaminated by evil forces (perhaps from Ilsensine's realm), or a still suddenly stops working when a petitioner "ascends" to become one with it - the PCs have to convince it that this is a false ascension, and to merge with Vergadain or Hanseath instead, if they want free beer. Beer brewed by ancient petitioners in the realm of a god may have exotic properties, like the ability to heal unusual curses or make those who imbibe it drunk forever.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

          Soot Hall        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Soot Hall</span></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Dugmaren Brightmantle's realm:</span> The hall of Dugmaren Brightmantle and his many petitioners is the largest and most accessible part of Soot Hall, containing thousands of workshops where those souls who worshipped Dugmaren in life can continue any number of experiments and projects for all eternity. Many petitioners have their own personal workplaces, while others collaborate on imaginative and sometimes improbable devices. There are libraries, too, where petitioners record their theories and discoveries for posterity, the books protected from the otherwise ubiquitous soot and smoke of the realm through clever devices that channel wind through the corridors. It's said that books are to the petitioners of Dugmaren as soul-gems are to petitioners of Dumathoin - a crucial part of their evolution and their path of ascension to oneness with their patron. Others say it's the crafts and inventions of Dugmaren's followers through which they gain their final reward. Even the petitioners themselves do not agree on this, and their arguments over this issue can often be heard ringing in the corridors. </p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Laduguer's former realm: </span>Laduguer, the Lord of Toil, once dwelled in Soot Hall as a patron of magic and crafts, long ago before Dugmaren Brightmantle came into his own. In those days Soot Hall was a sterner, grimmer place, as suited the preeminent god of the realm. Laduguer's followers consider their god to be the creator of the universe, and as such Soot Hall was the center of their cosmos, the source of all there is. The abandoned hall that was once Laduguer's still exists in Soot Hall, sealed off and shunned but impossible for the current inhabitants to destroy. Within, the walls are unfurnished and unadorned, but forges, dark and cold, are still set into the walls. The duergar teach that the stars and planets were made in these forges, and if someone - not necessarily their master - were to rekindle them, new worlds might be forged once again. Until this happens, the coals at the centers of the various worlds will slowly dim, and entropy will claim all that is. The jealous and spiteful other dwarven gods neglect the forges, but perhaps a duergar craftsman of sufficient skill could venture into those chill halls and resume the act of creation the gods have abandoned. </p>

<p>Exactly why Laduguer left this realm and relocated to Acheron is a matter of some dispute. Priests of Moradin claim he was banished for his wickedness, while the duergar maintain he left over a matter of honor. A legend from one world says the duergar, Laduguer's chosen people, had been enslaved by the illithids, and Laduguer refused to associate any further with the other dwarven gods because of their refusal to aid them. </p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Diirinka's former realm:</span> Diirinka, the patron of the derro, once dwelled among the Morndinsamman as well, and when he did his realm was in Soot Hall. He cared little for forging metal or carving stone; his interest was in magical research and the creation of life. He was a minor godling in those days, frustrated that his curiosity about magic, the many questions he burned with, wasn't taken seriously by his fellow gods. Even old Thautam merely chuckled at his questions and urged him to be patient, advising him that there were some arts that were not proper for dwarves. Diirinka rebelled at this advice, deciding that if the knowledge he desired could not be gained from the other dwarven gods, he would descend deeper into the mountain, into the tangled caverns of Ilsensine, and wrest knowledge from there. With his brother Diinkarazan his only companion and confidant, he ventured below Deepshaft Hall on this foolhardy quest. He found the knowledge he wanted, but at such a horrific price - the freedom and sanity of his brother - that he was no longer welcome among the Morndinsamman. Moradin exiled him in disgust. Diirinka went elsewhere to create his chosen race, using his newfound knowledge to warp and twist the half-human slaves of the mortal Suloise empire into his conception of the ideal form, spreading his new people across the worlds. </p>

<p>Diirinka's former hall, like Diinkarazan's and Laduguer's, is sealed off and shunned in recent millennia. Some of his early equipment is still there, however - glass, fluid-filled chambers, centrifuges, occult circles, books of forbidden lore, even living creatures that have remained in suspended animation there for all this time: hideous hybrids of dwarves with aberrations, fungi, and beasts, none of them healthy enough to live for long once freed. At the time Diirinka made them, he had little more power than any other knowledgeable mage, and not nearly enough knowledge to be the demiurge he desired to be. Still, there is certainly enough here for a foolish or ambitious mage to do some real damage if they were to find a way past the gods' seals. </p>

<p>Why Diirinka's laboratory wasn't simply destroyed is an open question, but it's likely that the other gods felt the life incubating there was still sacred in some way, still dwarven, for all that Diirinka had corrupted it, and they're reluctant to destroy dwarven life that, after all, committed no crime itself. Because even setting them free would be a death sentence, the gods have elected to keep them in perpetual limbo, neither dead nor truly alive, rather than rushing to make a final decision. Being immortal, after all, means you have all the time in the world. Likely they should have sent the contents of the lab to Moradin to be reforged long ago, but they're reluctant to confront, or even fully admit to themselves, the horrors that Diirinka committed while still dwelling among them.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Tharmakhul's realm:</span> Tharmakhul is Moradin's assistant, and as such spends much of his time in Erackinor at the Soul Forge, but when he is not needed with his master he works on his own projects in his personal forge in Soot Hall. As a neutral deity, he feels very comfortable in the Outlands. Here he and his few petitioners create weapons, armor, and tools in a forge as hot as the sun. A portal to the Elemental Plane of Fire is known to exist here, leading to one of the towers of the azers where the azer king Amaimon spends some of his time.</p>

<p>Rumors have it that Tharmakhul has begun creating a weapon of some sort, one he is reluctant to show to even his fellow gods. Only his highest-ranking proxies know anything about it, and they aren't telling. Some among Dugmaren Brightmantle's circle worry that this is because the weapon is so dangerous that the other gods would disapprove of it; they distrust Tharmakhul and his fiery, alien nature.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Thautam's realm:</span> Thautam, the blind dwarven god of darkness and magic, is quite possibly older than Moradin, and acts as something like a kindly uncle to the rest of the pantheon. He is the first dwarven god to dwell in Soot Hall, and likely the first one to dwell in Dwarven Mountain; only Valkauna may have existed as long as him. Thautam is undoubtedly the one who trained Laduguer, and he is still on amiable terms with that deity even when the rest of the pantheon has rejected him. Diirinka, too, was his student for a time, and that one was his greatest regret. It's said that Thautam wishes he had a way to still communicate with his wayward apprentice in his dripping caverns in Pandemonium, believing naively that he might still be redeemable. More than one worshiper of Thautam has ventured into the Howling Plane to do just that, never to return.</p>

<p>Thautam and his petitioners are much more traditional and conservative than those of Dugmaren Brightmantle, creating magical items along time-tested dwarven patterns rather than experimenting with new forms and flights of fancy. The petitioners of Thautam consider Dugmaren's flock to be flighty and unreliable, while Dugmaren's flock considers Thautam's faithful to be a bunch of stodgy sticks-in-the-mud cursed to endlessly repeat themselves rather than adding to the knowledge of the dwarven race. The two groups rarely mix, and have little to say to one another when they do; their outlooks are too different for them even to argue for very long. Thautam's halls are entirely lightless, every petitioner as blind as their master. When they write, they carve into stone. Most have little reason to carve anything new.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">
