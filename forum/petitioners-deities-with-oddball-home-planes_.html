        <div class="dice_rolls">
</div> <p>Ok, primarily as a DM, but also as a player (I have a Cleric of Kelemvor character), I've become very curious about this because I'm in the position of doing a bit of planescape work with PCs.</p>

<p>The question is...</p>

<p>Assume you have a character, of one alignment who worships a deity of same (or similar) alignment, but the deity's home plane is greatly opposed in alignment to both the deity and the worshiper.</p>

<p>Where does the petitioner go upon death?</p>

<p>Does being a cleric of said deity change the answer?</p>

<p>I'll use my own character to demonstrate how the answer, given sufficient study of planeslore, could have a rather substantial impact on a character.</p>

<p>Take a Cleric of Kelemvor who is LG/LN.  The god is LN.  Yet Kelemvor rules over the Crystal Spire in the City of Judgement in.... the Grey Wastes.  While preaching action-&gt;result and that all receive their proper fates, the condition of larvae upon the Grey Wastes, where all feel the incredibly oppressive force of despair inherent to the plane hardly seems a just or even desirable fate for Kelemvor's more goodly servants (especially his paladins?).</p>

<p>The question also arises for some other folk I DM for where character alignment is at great variance to deity alignment (most often where the character is NOT a cleric and thus need not be within 1 step of the deity's alignment).</p>

<p>Where do such characters end up, are each option possible and what determines the choice made?  Who, precisely, (presumably under Kelemvor in the FRCS) makes this determination?</p>

<p>Forgive me if these are all answered in some easily available source, but I've had quite a level of difficulty finding the answer to them in web searches and what material I have available.</p>       </div>

         <p>A god can simply decree that certain effects of the overall plane don't apply within his realm.  One excellent example from the Grey Wastes is the Glitterhell, realm of Abbathor, dwarven god of greed.  Full of gold and gems, it's actually quite colorful and beautiful, and the sight of it can lift the spirits of travelers who have been pressed by the Waste.  (Surviving the actual realm, as well as the remainder of the trip out of the Waste, is an entirely separate affair.)</p>

<p>If Kelemvor holds to an interpretation of the Waste that doesn't involve crushing despair for all, he needn't make his petitioners suffer it.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>First of all: BLOODY HELL! I got an error and everything I just typed disappeared.  :x</p>

<p>So, secondly, on to your question. As I understand it, and anybody should correct me if I'm wrong, here is how it would work out:</p>

<p>All pious people that held their deity's favour throughout their lives will, barring any extraneous circumstances (such as losing a bet with a demon lord or dropkicking a Baernaloth's foot), end up in their deity's realm after death. Agnostics end up randomly on a plane matching their alignment while atheists, at least according to some 2e sources, end up in Asmodeus' belly.</p>

<p>Deities are powerful, in all respects. Their willpowers are so powerful that they can suppress the natural ambience of an outer plane with their subconscious thoughts alone, creating areas around them (aka their realms) that match their alignments and desires instead. They can also change the forms and abilities of any of the petitioners that end up spending the rest of eternity at their kips.</p>

<p>The Toril deities are an oddly tight-knit bunch, forming an almost worldwide pantheon on their particular corner of the Material. The beliefs of that world also seem somewhat contrary to what the planars know is true. Belief, however, is a powerful thing, so as long as their deity agrees, a spirit will go precisely where it believed it would. In Toril, I think it is a general consensus that everybody goes to Kelemvor's realm except very pious clerics, which end up in their particular deity's kip. Kelemvor, not being particularly evil, would probably suppress the evil of the surrounding Wastes and create a hospitable little nook to keep the depressing greys away from his precious petitioners. He is also likely to change the form that the petitioners take into something other than larvae, which are a manifestation of the souls' evil anyway.</p>

<p>So, have no fear, your pious little god puppet will end up in safe hands, far away from the surrounding grey, even if his alignment is different from his deity's or the plane on which said deity resides.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;Iavas&#039;</em> wrote:</div>while atheists, at least according to some 2e sources, end up in Asmodeus' belly.</div></p>

<p>And might I just say that that one paragraph in the sourcebook nearly turned me off of Planescape completely, it was so hideously offensive.</p>

<p>Primes who have the wrong idea about the Outer Planes don't dissipate or count as atheists; they show up at a plane that matches their alignment, if not in the realm of a god.  If someone truly believes in <span style="font-style:italic">nothing</span> -- not the innate goodness or potential of man, no set of ethical principles, not even his personal strength, greeds or ambitions, just an empty shell of a soul living a life worth nothing -- then I could see him heading directly to the realm of the king of devils to be devoured.  Frankly, such a soul already devoured himself.</p>

<p>But a NG cleric of the Great Unknown who spends his life fighting the machinations of evil, from the devils to the tanar'ri, and mending the wounds of the struggle on innocent souls wherever he can, ends up in the bottommost pit of the Nine Hells as, direct quote, "the true damned of the multiverse," because he didn't believe the gods were really gods?  What a hateful piece of blind bigotry.</p>

<p>The reason I suspect such a line got into the setting is simple Christian theology.  Atheists, according to this exceedingly common interpretation, aren't really atheists.  They haven't considered and rejected the evidence for the existence of a god or the supernatural.  The atheist, like all men, actually knows Jesus in his soul, and has made the choice to reject His grace out of a desire to do as he wills regardless of God's commandments.  (The rational thought process that would lead anyone to take a few years of hedonism in exchange for eternal damnation is never made very clear.)  So, regardless of the words or actions an atheist puts forth -- in Planescape, regardless of the alignment an atheist or Athar acts -- at the root, he is the most evil possible creature in existence, a thinking being who has rationally rejected all light and goodness in the Universe.</p>

<p>The line you quote equates having no religious beliefs with having no beliefs or morals at all, as many religious persons do.  I <span style="font-weight:bold">trust strongly</span> that the editors of the Planescape Campaign Setting here on this site repudiate such an offensive, bigoted notion, on which fortunately no other substantial portion of the Planescape canon rests.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I fully agree with Jem's assessment of the origin of the idea that atheists end up having their soul's devoured by Asmodeus.  And I am equally offended by it.</p>

<p>Iavas while I agree with what you said, you made an error in saying that in the FR cosmology everyone except pious clerics end up in Kelemvor's realm.  Everyone in the FR cosmology initially has their soul travel to Kelemvor's realm (the plane of Fugue); after which they travel to the realm of their deity.  Those who worship no god have their souls used as mortar in the Plane of Fugue and eventually face oblivion.  Once again, this amounts to a display of intolerance towards atheists.  </p>

<p>In my campaign (which blur's the line between FR and PS) clerics, paladins, and similarly pious individuals go directly to the realm of their deity; everyone else ends up in the outer plane that matches their alignment.</p>

<p>As far as petitioners with deities in really oddball planes go, what precisely happens for the clerics of deities who make their home in planes other than the Outer Planes?</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I agree with you for the most part, Jem. The only disagreement is the definition of atheists. In the real world, atheists are those that do not believe in the god or gods of the religion doing the defining. In Planescape, on the other hand, I think that atheist means precisely what you said - not believing in anything, be it gods, morals, ethics, or even the lack thereof. In Planescape, the true atheists are those who waste their life in pointless idle business. Those that do not follow any of the gods, such as the Athar, are not devoured by Asmodeus or punished in any way. They simply go to the plane matching their alignment. They are the Planescape version of agnostic, so to speak, because they believe in something, just not a deity. Now, granted, real world atheists might balk at the comparison, but then again, so would real world clerics at their RPG counterparts. Personally, until I find a more suitable world, atheist will have to do. The Athar are not atheists. If anything, they are agnostic, with their belief in a multiversal power. Since Planescape, and RPG's in general, are a modified simplification of the real world, you really shouldn't take it to heart like the fundamentalists do.</p>

<p>MakThuumNgatha, again, do not take offense. I am in no way condemning real world atheists. I'm simply using the word with a meaning modified for the Planescape setting. By all means, suggest a better alternative.<br />
As for the way the Forgotten Realms work, I am no expert. I remember that everybody goes to the fugue plane (Kelemvor's realm), but I wasn't aware that non-clerics went to their deity's realms. I was pretty sure that non-clergy lived in the fuge plane's city, which was composed of those that had no belief whatsoever.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Also, before this thread gets horribly derailed (which would, I admit, be entirely my fault), I notice there's another question Lorloth asked which hasn't been answered: what happens to worshipers of a deity that don't much follow that deity's alignment?</p>

<p>Lorloth, I'd say that the worship in that case is either not very sincere, or is only selected for a specific few aspects.  A sincere worshiper would value the god's ethics, and make an effort to follow them; even if they're not perfect at it, their alignment is clearly similar to that of the deity.  The person you describe here is sort of an "Easter-and-Christmas" churchgoer.  In that respect, they're not really a worshiper at all.  Now, that doesn't mean I think they should get mortared into a wall... they should just head to whatever plane suits their <span style="font-style:italic">real</span> alignment.</p>

<p>This leads to amusing things like a CG worshiper of a LG deity winding up on, say, Arborea, a bit flustered... and then he gets a look at the peaceful tranquillity of the realm where he might have ended up, and decides he's much better off where the fun is happening anyway!  :^)  Or, more seriously, a LE worshiper of that LG deity who goes to church regularly, knows the scriptures by heart, and uses them constantly to attempt to one-up others, get the community to shun people he doesn't like, excuses his own cruelties because he knows he's got special permission, being so righteous, he always follows all the rules, even "love thy neighbor," it's tough love sometimes but... ...hey.  Hey!  Why has he shown up in Baator?  That's not right?  No... no!  <span style="font-style:italic">He was good!</span>  He followed all the rules!  He was <span style="font-style:italic">better than them!</span></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I'm of the opinion that it depends on the god. St. Cuthbert probably wouldn't accept chaotic petitioners (at least without a good reason), but Wee Jas might. The Demon Princes probably don't want lawful people in their realms, but would revel in the chance to corrupt goodies, and so forth. I think it all depends on the strength of one's belief and the inclination of one's god.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Iavas, I no where suggested that I believed that you were condemning atheists.  But our society's intolerance for atheism has even found its way into DnD and outrage needs to be stirred up.</p>

<p>Jem, if you didn't bring up the Biblical origins of the idea that atheists are devoured by the King of the Devils, I would have.  For your other point, I think that easiest solution is that being a petitioner in the realm of your god is a fate reserved for clerics and the similarly pious.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>That's a really good question with, I think, no firm answers. My own instincts say that a sincere worshiper of a deity (to the relative exclusion of other deities) ends up in that deity's realm by default, regardless of their alignment. When you pledge yourself to a god, that god owns your soul.</p>

<p>The god, at that point, has the option of rejecting your soul if it would cause problems (no NE serial killers slaughtering fellow worshipers in Pelor's realm), casting you to the fiends of the lower planes (or to the eladrins/modrons/slaadi/rilmani/archons, as appropriate). The god also has the option of creating a prison within the main realm for disobedient/sinful souls, possibly a purgatory where the soul might eventually find release if it learns the true way and repents, or possibly a hell where the deity punishes the transgressor without release for all eternity - after all, that's a source of power, just as worship is. An evil deity would probably torture or devour a good soul rather than release it to the celestials, or trade it to the fiends at a profit.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I don't think that question has really been addressed in DnD - I suppose b/c the designers have assumed if you worship X deity, you *are* going to follow their tenets, or find a god that suits you better. The idea of a disobedient believer just hasn't gotten brought up. </p>

<p>I'm much with Rip on this one - I would say that since you swore your soul/worshiped to that Power, the Power will have the ultimate say. I'm inclined to believe that the power will *keep* you instead of throwing you to anyone else - after all even the disobedient worshiper is still a worshiper and hence a source of belief and power. The disobedient can still serve their Power as an example to others on what not to do.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>The judgement of the deity in question being final sounds fine, though the chaotic deities might care less about such things. Does make you think about the more extreme cases, though. Didn't the archons let some evil guy build his fortress on the shores of the Silver Sea in his quest for redemption (don't have the MotP lying around)? Not really a case involving a deity, but still, I suppose there's more cases like that. It's not that hard to imagine a vilian repenting on his deathbed, nor a deity that's actually benevolent enough to give the dying soul a shot at redemption.</p>

<p>Though I don't want to get any more off topic, the atheist-thing got me thinking. In the sense that an atheist may not believe in an afterlife at all and that bodies are made up of nothing but matter that decays after death (pretty much the standard naturalist position) sounds like a ticket on the train to True Death to me. Isn't that what the Dusties aspire to, a state of absolute non-being? There's the bit about letting go of your emotions, of course, but if some clueless prime has the idea that death is total obliteration, I'm sure that could be granted (with maybe a bit of a pit-stop in Hades for having such a bleak outlook on the afterlife, if such a view can be seen as pertaining to an afterlife at all).</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Well said Jem, well said.</p>

<p>Being atheist, believing that no god exists, is in no way the same thing as having no set of morals or ethics, or lacking faith in human potential. Yet that is the accusation perpetually thrown at atheists: that they have no morals, that every one of them is depraved.</p>

<p>Having a set of ethics and morals should without a doubt send a person to a plain of alignment. Beliefs in ethics, morality, and secular humanism are just as much beliefs and they have plenty of resonance with alignment and the planes.</p>

<p>If the writers of that statement meant "atheist" in the sense that Iavas thinks they might have meant it, then why didn't they just say "extremely nihilistic people who believe neither in gods nor even in morals" instead of "atheists"? The word itself has a very definite meaning and it covers members of the Athar faction as well, since AFAIK not all of them believe in the Great Beyond.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;Clueless&#039;</em> wrote:</div>I'm much with Rip on this one - I would say that since you swore your soul/worshiped to that Power, the Power will have the ultimate say. I'm inclined to believe that the power will *keep* you instead of throwing you to anyone else - after all even the disobedient worshiper is still a worshiper and hence a source of belief and power. The disobedient can still serve their Power as an example to others on what not to do.</div></p>

<p>Hmm.  I'm not sure I like the implications of that.  Good deities collect evil souls that gave them lip service, and maintain a hell on the Upper Planes?  Evil deities collect the souls of people who signed contracts with them, regardless of any repentance or atonement, however sincere?</p>

<p>I'd think we could keep a very simple system that's conceptually clean by using the following interpretation: going to the realm of a deity is simply a particular case of going to the plane that matches one's alignment.</p>

<p>In a very concrete sense, a deity who sets up a domain on an Outer Plane is staking out conceptual territory.  Within all of the Outlands, which represents neutrality, Obad-Hai rules over that portion which represents a <span style="font-style:italic">particular interpretation</span> of neutrality: nature which embraces all, good and evil, law and chaos.  Boccob has an entirely different interpretation: the objectivity demanded by one who would know truth.</p>

<p>If you're a sincere N worshiper of Obad-Hai, then you consider him and his ethos to be the best way of looking at the world, you try to be open-minded and accepting, or whatever his morals teach.  You'll end up in his realm.  If you follow similar beliefs of your own accord, without ever having heard of him, then it's still reasonable that you'll end up in his realm, not Boccob's.  If you're a NG worshiper of Obad-Hai, maybe you believe the scriptures but have real trouble with the part about not going around smiting evil berks, even the ones that aren't disturbing nature.  You might end up in his realm... but maybe you're more "Good" than "Neutral," and you'd be more comfortable spending the afterlife in the Beastlands.  If you're a NG <span style="font-style:italic">cleric</span> of his, you're probably making more effort to toe the party line, and can face the prospect of being a petitioner along with some NE fellow-worshipers, with eternity to help you both learn about dialogue and such.  If you're a CG worshiper of his who chafes at rules, mostly goes on high holy days because your community would be scandalized if you didn't, spends the rest of the time out practicing his axe work, and secretly thinks those Norse deities really know how an honorable warrior should live his life... well?</p>

<p>In the same vein, what if you were infant-baptized into your parents' church of a LG deity, rebelled and got inducted into a CN deity's cult when you were a teenager, went through a bad phase in your later teens where you signed a contract with a LE deity, then grew up a couple of years later and realized how <span style="font-style:italic">bloody stupid</span> that was, started acting your age and entered a monastery of Pelor, where you died... which pledge functions?  First dibs?  First choice made of your own free will?  The devil contract supersede everything?  Pelor gets you 'cause you picked him last?</p>

<p>Let's keep it simple: you wind up, not where you gave lip service, but in the plane that suits your alignment when you died.  If joining the monastery and mouthing the rituals was actually a panicky attempt to get out of paying for your deeply-enjoyed contract... it doesn't work.  If it was a legitimate "oh my god look at the awful things I've been doing what have I become this isn't right" act of repentance, then yes, it does.  Under this interpretation, I'd even say signing a contract with a devil doesn't damn you -- except for the very important fact that signing a contract with a devil is a notably evil and lawful act.  The only force it really has, then, would be between devils arguing over who owns the soul when it gets to Hell.  Damning someone takes more than lip service, and when the contract is signed any devil worth his salt will cultivate his investment by making sure the signer continues to act diabolically.</p>

<p>This way everything sums up very nicely.  Alignment = plane.  Particular flavor of alignment = particular god's domain.  Clerics and sincere worshipers are simply very likely to hold that particular flavor of alignment.  See?</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Nice system, Jem. I want to raise a couple of points:</p>

<p>1) Does a person stop changing after (s)he dies and becomes a petitioner? If a person can sincerely change his/her alignment multiple times during life, what is to stop them from doing the same after death? After all, even if most petitioners do not remember their lives, they retain their habits and personalities, and that includes such mutability.</p>

<p>2) Are there any real differences between petioners belonging to a deity and those that plomped down on the plane due to their alignment? Hades' petitioners end up looking like shades while other NE petitioners end up as larvae. Is only the shape different, as the God decrees, or is there something that changes in their nature as well? What decrees the form of a petitioner not affiliated with a deity? </p>

<p>3) How much should be left up to the imagination? After all, powers are called so for a reason, and no mortal is meant to fathom their ways. Even if the Athar are right and they are just really tough berks that found a way to use belief to their advantage, should we really have a definite system for which souls go where and via what conduit?</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

          Petitioners of Deities with Oddball Home Planes        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;Jem&#039;</em> wrote:</div>I'd think we could keep a very simple system that's conceptually clean by using the following interpretation: going to the realm of a deity is simply a particular case of going to the plane that matches one's alignment. In a very concrete sense, a deity who sets up a domain on an Outer Plane is staking out conceptual territory.</div></p>

<p>The problem with this theory, although I agree with some of it, is that it makes the deities out to be little more than the territories they control. In fact, they're willful, powerful entities with agendas of their own beyond merely acting as custodians of Outer Planar real estate. Many actually dwell on planes other than the Outer Planes - by your theory, deities like Geb (who dwells on the Elemental Plane of Earth) and Fharlanghn (who wanders the Material Plane) would receive no petitioners. Their worshipers, even the most devout, would journey to the Outer Planes to the Outer Planar territory where their deity <span style="font-style:italic">would</span> dwell if it chose to dwell in the Outer Planes. By your theory also, gods who dwell on planes that don't match their alignments - Ares in Arborea, Ratri in the Gray Waste, Shang-ti in Mechanus - would only receive those worshipers who are unlike them philosophically, and those who are like them philosophically would end up with no god guiding them. </p>

<p>Yes, your theory is much simpler, but it requires upending much of the Planescape canon. This is fine, of course, if that's what you want to do. I want to always encourage people to make the game into whatever they want. But I submit that simpler is not always better. I like the idea that the Outer Planes are not always homogeneous in their alignments - that there may be inhabitants of Elysium who are evil, and inhabitants of the Gray Waste that are good. I like things a bit messier. Things work differently in divine realms than they do in the plane as a whole.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>In the same vein, what if you were infant-baptized into your parents' church of a LG deity, rebelled and got inducted into a CN deity's cult when you were a teenager, went through a bad phase in your later teens where you signed a contract with a LE deity, then grew up a couple of years later and realized how <span style="font-style:italic">bloody stupid</span> that was, started acting your age and entered a monastery of Pelor, where you died... which pledge functions?</div></p>

<p>If you were a faithful worshiper of Pelor at the time of your death, you go to Pelor. To Iavas, I would say that yes - it's possible for a petitioner to change alignments and philosophies even after death. A compassionate deity may allow a petitioner to leave if it desires to, or the petitioner may be freed or escape on its own. Celestials or fiends may arrive to "rescue" petitioners who are unhappy in their current abodes. If there is no deity involved, the petitioner may just walk to to the nearest portal on the Great Road. Or they may be happy there despite their alignment. </p>

<p>Alignment, and I think this bears stressing, is not the sum total of a person's personality. Someone may not agree with Obad-hai about everything but still be happier in Obad-hai's realm than she would be in the Beastlands or Elysium. This is because, though she might be neutral good, she doesn't necessarily agree with the spectrum of neutral good about everything either. She may appreciate other aspects of Obad-hai's character that have nothing to do with alignment. Or maybe she gets along with Obad-hai's neutral worshipers better than she gets along with non-neutral people who don't worship Obad-hai, because although good-natured herself there are other aspects of other neutral good peoples' characters that rub her wrong. Or maybe she wishes to spend the afterlife with some very specific people, people who she may not fully remember in the afterlife but who nontheless resonate with her soul. Maybe those people were friends and family in life, or maybe they merely should have been.</p>

<p>Should there be a place in the Upper Planes for such exceptions to the general "consensus" in a certain alignment? Probably - the Upper Planes are hardly homogeneous - but there should be a place in Obad-hai's realm for such people as well. </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Under this interpretation, I'd even say signing a contract with a devil doesn't damn you -- except for the very important fact that signing a contract with a devil is a notably evil and lawful act. </div></p>

<p>I say it's not. Signing a contract is a lawful act, but there's nothing inherently evil about it. And though contracts are lawful by nature, the fact that you've entered into one doesn't make <span style="font-style:italic">you</span> lawful. If you entered into it with the intention of breaking it, by your theory you should end up in Carceri or the Abyss; if signing a contract with fiends is evil, signing a contract in bad faith is certainly chaotic. The contract, however, binds the signer's soul because a soul is, in this cosmos, something that can be bound. </p>

<p>While your theory is very neat, I fear that personality and personal preference are not so neat. They are messy things, and I believe the planes should follow suit.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Some of this may depend on the strength of the pantheon. The Greeks, if we go by place names, have so many worshipers that hardly anyone can match their power on the rare occasions when they all work together.

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Thanks for the responses so far.</p>

<p>There's an element of what I was getting at, however, which seems to have been overlooked, which is the matter of complication introduced by a combination of planar lore and free will:</p>

<p>In essence, what happens when a mortal (the rat in the maze) realizes the nature of the game?</p>

<p>This is perhaps an especially important point to consider for evil characters with a great deal of planar lore.  Ironically, it is the evil characters supposedly most devoted to their deities (the clerics) who would be at most risk to the revelation that an afterlife as a petioner in Baator or the Abyss might not make power in the present life on the Prime so worthwhile.  They both have higher wisdom scores AND are more likely to have planar lore than other evil characters.</p>

<p>This would perhaps produce, or one would think, a number of evil clerics who supposedly chose their deity for power on the Prime realizing that the bargain is a REALLY bad idea because they are both wise enough and knowledgeable enough to do so.</p>

<p>This would, by extention if applied from a micro to a macro scale, have a seriously detrimental effect upon the faith of any evil deity.</p>

<p>It could also lead to situations where a sufficiently wise and clever Lawful Evil character could sincerely worship a Lawful Neutral or even Lawful Good deity because they offer more "room for advancement" when the character in question becomes petitioner.</p>

<p>The end result is pretty bad for the faith of evil deities.</p>

<p>One might fix this situation by purporting that evil clerics must in some way be insane or lack sense, but this runs up against their.... insane wisdom scores.</p>

<p>Perhaps this means that evil deities simply don't have very high level or high power clerics because anyone with that much power realizes the game is stacked against them and they better get out before it's too late?</p>

<p>I saw another thread on this forum discuss the possibility of a mortal becoming a fiend.  It seems an elegant solution to the problem.  However, it also seems a solution with at least some level of variance from Planescape canon if what I'm lead to believe is true (please correct me if not).</p>

<p>Was this a problem merely not considered when the Planescape setting was built, is my ignorance toward rewards given to the servants of evil deities the issue here, or was it assumed that planar lore would be rare enough on the prime as to reduce the problem?</p>

<p>Seeing at least the ubiquity of large amounst of planar lore available to people in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting (I'm not as familiar with others), it seems to produce a rather obvious problem to me.</p>

<p>In essense, what rewards is a powerful servant of an evil deity or a duke of hell being promised in the afterlife so that they don't bolt the moment they realize that they'd rather not end up a petitioner there?</p>

<p>Personally, I think the following would be an elegant solution:</p>

<p>Those who serve an evil deity -willingly- and -devoutly- are promised a place in the afterlife above the poor fools who are damned to the lower planes for evil in life, but who were not devout toward the evil deities.  Evil clerics are at the top of the pile coming through the gate.</p>

<p>That said, to offer incentive for mortals (especially powerful mortals such as archmagi, their own clerics, and powerful champions) to worship and serve them, evil deities might very well offer room for advancement in the afterlife to mortal servants of worth.  The best, most useful, and most devout might even become fiends themselves.</p>

<p>Otherwise you have the inherent problem of evil deities both desiring and needing to attract souls whose primary interest is self-interest, but who have utterly no interest in serving an evil deity.  If it's ALL just trickery, you have a serious problem with powerful, knowledgeable, and wise servants - precisely the ones any evil deity will most covet.</p>

<p>Is there a solution already in the setting for this or is there one that would need to be devised?</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>It's very easy... the people that serve evil deities are evil to begin with. What can change the nature of a man? It's note asy. So, the evil clerics, with their good intelligence and wisdom scores, catch on to the fact that it's better to be a servant of an evil deity than a larval snack of an evil fiend.

         <p>Lorloth, it is the obsession with 'self', or ego, that attracts evil clerics to evil gods and allows them to ignore their eventual fate.  Evil people are largely focused on their personal power and advancement.  Even when their selfishness leads them misery they maintain faith that if they just become more powerful, wealthier, or gather more followers they will be happy.  Their entire existence is centered around this self, leading them to ignore (to a limited extent) the larger picture.  Evil individuals with high wisdom and high intelligence can understand the large picture and understand others; but are concerned with such things only insofar as they relate to themselves (their ego).  Since death necessarily involves the loss of ego (memories, skills, levels, etc.), it may as well be oblivion in the eyes of an evil man; since who they were before has passed.  Because of this, damnation is an empty threat in their eyes.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>In my opinion... </p>

<p>IF (soul) is (dedicated to and accepted by deity X) --&gt; soul enters realm of deity X. Degree of dedication required to enter is between the mortal and the deity. <br />
ELSE IF (soul) is (claimed by poweful planeborne being) --&gt; soul enters into possession of powerful planeborne being. Example: Villain sells his soul to a balor for temporal power and revenge against a hated enemy. <br />
ELSE <br />
Soul always travels to most closely corresponding alignment plane (may be inhibited by absence of planar connection between the mortal's Prime world and said plane). </p>

<p>However, this is also affected by the belief system of a particular Prime world. If a Prime culture believes that everyone who doesn't die in battle (Valhalla) ends up in Hel, the soul may well end up in Niflheim, regardless of alignment. What really matters here is the DM's whim and the tone and style of a particular campaign -- but I would use the guidelines above as the default (god/planeborne/alignment plane) as the defaults unless a setting gives a reason not to. </p>

<p>IMO, even if a person believes in nothing (not a god, philosophy, or what have you), that still doesn't qualify him to end up being eaten by Asmodeus -- who is, after all, only one of four extreme alignment poles. Really, why him? Why LE? In the worst case, the soul might dissipate, having nothing to hold it together, but more likely it'd end up in the most appropriate alignment plane (possibly Outlands). </p>

<p>About the self and evil. Many believe that good = concern for others more than self and evil = concern for self more than others. However! Lots of evil belief systems approve of the destruction of a person's natural self (so that it can be remade into something more inclined to evil). LE belief systems, for example. If a person has natural tendencies toward kindness and mercy toward (chosen enemy of LE society), of course his fellows might attempt to crush them.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I suppose the latest question comes down to why people would worship evil deities in the first place.</p>

<p>To be honest... I don't think they do.</p>

<p>D&amp;D abstracts the real world sufficiently that good and evil (and notable lack of either) can be detected and measured as an objective quality.  Theoretically, this should make telling right from wrong very easy, and yet we know of paladins who have fallen and hard moral choices made every day on the planes.</p>

<p>In my opinion, people worship evil deities because they think those deities are good -- they are aware that powers like <span style="font-style:italic">detect evil</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">detect good</span> exist, but simply disagree with the vast majority of the planes on which is which.</p>

<p>Abbathor is a god of greed?  Well, yes -- <span style="font-style:italic">greed is good!</span>  It stimulates innovation and healthy competition; it is a natural drive that underlies growth and progress.  People who disagree with that are either well-intentioned ignoramuses, or demagogues trying to hoard the value on the planes for themselves.  If Abbathor ruled the world, economic realities would naturally raise us all toward utopia -- and his realm is an example of that, where the strong are rightly rich.  I am strong, and I will do well there.</p>

<p>Erythnul is a god of slaughter?  Naturally!  To quote our world, <span style="font-style:italic">"Violence, naked force, has settled more issues in history than has any other factor, and the contrary opinion is wishful thinking at its worst."</span>  Slaughter is violence in its purest form, and Erythnul its deific representative.  He is the final power of the planes!  At the center of that power, I will serve and eventually rule.  That is his way.  If I am slaughtered, it is because I was weak.  I will not be weak.</p>

<p>And correct me if I'm wrong, but don't the nastiest LE petitioners occasionally start off as low-ranking devils of some kind, even to the point where they have to be demoted to lemures to advance?  Knowing that you'll earn a place in a well-organized society where your merits -- your strength, cunning, and value -- will determine your existence... that could appeal to people who worship LE entities, eyes wide open.  They see the worst things that could happen, but they also see the best, and they assume (not entirely without merit, being sharp enough to know this stuff in the first place) that they have what it takes to stay on top of the heap.  They know <span style="font-style:italic">you</span> call them evil.  They might even call you good... but it's an insult.</p>

<p>(Conversations like this are why a lot of people I know play Planescape light on the alignments.  ;^)  )</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I think Jem has a good thought here. But if you don't agree with him Mak has a good point too. The simplest way is that the evil deity says "You are evil. You have planar lore and you know if you die you'll end up as a larva. Well, if you serve me, not only will I give you power and wealth and slaves in life, but in death you'll keep your form. You won't have to be a larva. Hey, you can even keep your memories and ego!"</p>

<p>The part about keeping memories may be a lie, but who would remember? The whole thing may be a lie, but it takes a lot more planar lore to know how petitioners are shaped in a particular realm, than to know that LE petitioners are lemures that bigger devils torture and trample on.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I agree with a lot of that, Jem. On a given world (the Prime Material as a whole presumably has infinite members of all possible groups) I wouldn't expect to see evil-Power worshipers approach the numbers of good <span style="font-style:italic">unless</span> some evil deity can get Law and Order on its side.</p>

<p>This would normally rule out strong CE Powers unless they can benefit from a scapegoat role in some religion, or somehow reach religiously-minded CE people on many worlds. Apep probably uses the former approach. (Or perhaps he's somehow managed to pose as Shiva, which would explain a lot but leaves the question of the real Hindu god's location.)</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I haven't watched this movie in years, so it might be way worse than I remember it, but Al Pacino's actions as the devil in <span style="font-style:italic">Devil's Advocate</span> were a good example how a tricky evil being, be it a power or an exemplar, might slowly push an originally Good being into the depths of depravity without it noticing until it is too late. This also applies to clerics, who might join a cult that they thought worshipped a good power and only realize that it actually worships Evil when they are in the top tier and so embedded into and with the faith that they do not quit despite that knowledge.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">
