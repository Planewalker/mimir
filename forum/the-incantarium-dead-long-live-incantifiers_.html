</div> <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Prologue</span></p>

<p>The blood war lasts forever. A war of ideas, a war of belief, a war of fiends. Baatezu and Tan’ari, one the embodiment of tyrannical law, the other the incarnation of destructive anarchy. Since the first skirmish, it’s never seen pause. And never will, until one side is completely annihilated.</p>

<p>On the Gray Waste, on a blood soaked battlefield, lie countless corpses. A splash of crimson against the uniform gray. A band of creatures, native to the waste, scour the remains. Night hags.</p>

<p>"Come, there’s another live one over here!" On of them cries in a raspy voice.</p>

<p>The elder of the gray sisters makes her way across the carnage, enjoying the looks of rage, fear, and despair frozen on the faces around her. Fiends from both sides lay strewn at her feat, their bodies already cooling. But best of all were the mortals, their faces could not help but show the abject horror that they had experienced before their gruesome demise. Foolish, bloodthirsty mortals. Humans, elves, and hundreds of other races, who had actually thought that they could win fame and fortune in the Blood War. She strode across the battlefield, among thousands upon thousands of the dead.</p>

<p>It had been a relatively small skirmish. One with no clear winner. Which was good, for the hags at least. In the large-scale battles, one side usually came out on top, and decided to stick around. By the time the Hags got their pick of the battlefield, all they found were scraps. But it wasn’t meat the hags wanted. It wasn’t to loot the dead. It was to loot the living, to take something from them that was far, far more valuable then the armor they wore, or the weapons they fought with.</p>

<p>"Hurry! He has a glaive in his gut and he won’t be here much longer!" The lesser Night Hag said impatiently.</p>

<p>The mortal in question was a blood stained human, or is it tiefling? He certainly looked human enough, but his aura didn’t seem right. As if it mattered at this point. Nevertheless, the mortal raised his head to look at his rescuers, his ragged breath quickening as he saw the Hags. He tried to reach for a rune scribed sword lying nearby, but was pinned to the ground by the glaive.</p>

<p>The elder Night Hag stood over him, clutching a green and blue gem. She started to mumble syllables of arcane power.</p>

<p>The lesser night hag leaned close to his ear, close enough for him to smell her fetid breath. "I know what you thinking. I’ll bet you’re praying to each and every power you can think of, praying that you won’t die. You’re prayers about to be granted, I can assure you, you’re not likely to die for a very, very long time."</p>

<p>The night hag cackled and stepped away, the green and blue gem grew brighter, and brighter…</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Chapter one</span></p>

<p>The fiend landed a few feet from his Arcanaloth superior. The large, four armed beast lowered its canine-like head and folded its wings. "Sir, the Baatezu have the soulstones, as you requested. They are ready to trade for a contingent of Mezzoloths, and the information you promised them, as per the agreement."</p>

<p>The Arcanaloth folded his arms, drawing his gold and crimson robes closer as he looked down his furry muzzle. "Are you sure that they have them all?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I counted all four hundred myself." The Nycaloth said.</p>

<p>"Good. Then you won’t be worried with the news that if we are missing even a single soulstone, you will be added to the pile, is that understood?"</p>

<p>The Nycaloth lost his air of confidence, and shuffled uneasily. "Yes sir."</p>

<p>"Now, do you want to go and check again?"</p>

<p>"Yes sir."</p>

<p>The Arcanaloth sneered. "Go."</p>

<p>As the Nycaloth took to the air, the Arcanaloth smiled to himself. Four hundred soulstones. More than enough to bribe his way into certain records in the Tower Arcane. As the Yugoloth plotted, a portal in a nearby cave was opened, a portal to the Abyss.</p>

<p>The transaction was still in progress when the Tan’ari attacked. Dretch’s clawed their way through Lemures; a Bebilith slammed the Arcanaloth to the side, against a large rock. The Soulstone he had been examining was dashed against the rock, sending green and blue crystal fragments flying.</p>

<p>The air shimmered, and suddenly there was a person sitting where no person had been before.</p>

<p>He clutched his throbbing gut, blood pouring out of the wound. His eyes were swollen shut, but he still could sense, practically see, the magic ring on the hand of the dead Arcanaloth next to him.</p>

<p>Where he was, and what was happening, held no meaning to him. All that mattered was getting his hands on that ring. He crawled through the gray colored dirt, and grabbed the Arcanaloth's shoulder, trying to drag himself closer. He could feel himself drifting away. It wouldn’t be long now.</p>

<p>And then he felt the cold metal band. He clutched the ring, and felt it start to grow cold. As his vision of it dimmed, he felt the skin around his wound regrow, the torn organs heal and shift back into place. He absorbed the magic of that ring as thirstily as a dying man drinks water. He felt the swelling around his eyes reduce, and painfully opened them as he got to his feet, sturdying himself against the rock face.</p>

<p>His eyes were like liquid quicksilver.</p>

<p>He looked around, making as quick an examination of the surrounding area as possible. He was still on the Waste, which was bad. He was in the middle of a battle between the Baatazue, Tan’ari and… Yugoloth? To many to kill, and the Tan’ari seemed to be gaining the upper hand. Have to hide.</p>

<p>But gods be damned if he still didn’t hurt all over. He tried to walk, but found that his leg was still broken, it had only just begun to reknit. He dragged his broken leg as he made his way along the rock face.</p>

<p>It wasn’t long before he caught the attention of a Gelugon. The insectiod ice fiend outstretched his hand, and absentmindedly sent a wave of freezing cold in his direction. The Incantifier braced himself against the wall. The cone of cold caught him dead center, awashing his entire body with skin blistering cold, to no effect.</p>

<p>Actually, that’s not true. His leg, while still in pain could now support his weight, and several other minor cuts and bruises vanished. Doing his best to escape from the storm of claws, teeth, and spells around him, he ducked under a wounded Bebilith and made a run for the other side of an oddly shaped mound of dusty gravel. It was only when he reached the other side that he realized that it was a mostly disintegrated creature.</p>

<p>He waited for a nearby Retriever to direct its attention to a raging Pit Fiend before making a break for a rocky hill that looked like it might provide some decent cover. As he ran across the open plain between him and the hill, he heard an all too familiar scuttling sound. He turned and saw a crab-like Mezzoloth charging toward him. Frantically looking around for a weapon, he spotted the body of a fallen Barbazu, glaive still in hand. He snatched the weapon from the fallen corpse, and rather than wield it, held it by the shaft. The glaive seemed to lose some of its color, as if it was suddenly several years older. He tossed it away, and pointed a finger toward the Mezzoloth who was now only a few feet from spearing him.</p>

<p>He smiled, and uttered a word of arcane power. A tiny, paper thin blue beam lanced out from his finger, and hit the Mezzoloth in the chest, burning a tiny hole completely through its body and out the other side. The Mezzoloth staggered, and fell.</p>

<p>He finally closed the distance to the hill, a more than decent hiding spot. As he circled around, he was forced to slide to a stop, as it was he found himself teetering on the edge of the cave’s mouth.</p>

<p>He glanced back at the battle behind him. The Tan’ari were winning, and fast. Their superior numbers and surprise attack had won them the day, on this battlefield. They wouldn’t be distracted by the Baatazue for much longer, and by then he needed to have a hideout.</p>

<p>By the time that the last Baatazue was slain, he had already lowered himself into the cave, and was quickly seeking refuge in its deeper caverns. Unfortunately, from his retreat he didn’t see the Tan’ari forces move toward the cave, heading for their portal home.</p>

<p>It wasn’t long after that that he found himself at the tunnel's end. No more room, no place to hide. He crawled back through the cave, carefully looking for any branch of cavern he could have missed, when he heard them. He could actually hear the heavy footsteps of some of the larger fiends as they walked above him. He scurried toward the mouth of the cave, and silently cursed his luck when he saw the fiends just above it.</p>

<p>A Balor at the head of the group stepped forward, into the cave. He prepared himself quickly trying to think of some feat of magic that he might use to ward off the fiends, or better yet, escape.</p>

<p>He was just about to make his move when the Balor stopped, and drew a knife. It raised it, as if to strike at some invisible opponent, and then plunged it into its hand, the strength of the blow forcing it through its hand. The air shimmered, and the Balor faded away, but the shimmer remained. A portal.</p>

<p>The Tan’ari quickly stormed into the cave, one by one vanishing into the portal. It seemed like hours before the last fiend was through.</p>

<p>He waited a few moments longer, listening, and hearing nothing but the apathetic silence of the waste. He crawled out of the cave, and looked around.</p>

<p>The waste was as gray as he remembered. A gigantic splash of crimson on the ground, a backdrop for the countless bodies of various forms of evil. He trod through the corpses, picking up magical items when he found them, and devoured them. Until at last, he came across the chest, buried under the body of a Nycaloth, full of softly glowing gems.</p>

<p>He picked one up, and studied it for a moment. A fellow trapped soul. He dashed it against the ground. There was a shimmer, and a man appeared on the ground, screaming in absolute agony.</p>

<p>All the skin on his lower half had been burned away, and so had small portions of his fingers. He stopped screaming only long enough to sob out a feeble request.</p>

<p>"Make it stop, please just make it stop."</p>

<p>The man with the silver eyes didn’t respond. He only hung his head, leaned down, and incinerated the man’s head, as quickly and painlessly as possible. He glanced at the chest full of soulstones. How many contained souls who would die upon gaining their freedom? He would have to find a healer first.</p>

<p>He filled his bag with as many soulstones as possible. But there was still over half a chest full of soulstones left over. He dragged the chest over to the cave, and gently carried it as deep as he could go. No doubt, anyone looking for it would find it easily enough, but he’d be damned if he was going to let the hag’s have it for free.</p>

<p>He climbed out of the cave, picked a random direction, and began his march. Alone, across the waste.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Chapter 2</span></p>

<p> Day and night are often blurred on the Waste, so it is hard to tell exactly how long he wandered. All he knew was that the pack of soul stones was heavy, and it wasn’t long before he started to feel the emotional tug of the waste. Once or twice he had to dodge Mezzoloth patrols, and then came the day that he was spotted by a Nycaloth.</p>

<p>He was traveling across one of the many great open areas of the waste when the Nycaloth flew overhead. He had tried to find cover, but he was spotted. Seeing only an easy target, the Nycaloth dove, readying his axe. The man with the silver eyes waited, and then dodged to the left just in time to be missed by the axe, but managed to touch the Nycaloth’s arm while doing so, releasing a powerful flash of lightening. The Nycaloth spasmed momentarily, enough to disrupt his flight and drive him into the ground. The fiend got to its feet, no worse for the rough landing, and prepared to charge. The man with the silver eyes waited, and prepared a spell to ensnare the fiend in an invisible wall of blades when the fiend approached, when the Nycaloth made a surprise move. As the fiend charged, it threw its axe ahead of it, while preparing its claws for attack. The axe caught the silver eyed man in the shoulder, shattering the bone and driving him to the ground. The pack full of soul stones was torn from his arm, and fell to the ground, spilling its precious contents.</p>

<p>The Nycaloth leapt at the man, who hastily erected a weak shield of force. The Nycaloth slammed into the invisible shield, and fell. As the fiend hit the ground, there was a sound of breaking glass. The man with the silver eyes winced. There was a shimmer, and a man fell to the ground, gasping and clutching at his throat. His eyes a brilliant blue, and his skin the color of gold. An Aasimar. He spotted the fiend next to him, and rolled away in terror, still gasping for air.</p>

<p>The Nycaloth, momentarily surprised by the Aasimar’s sudden appearance, let his guard drop just long enough for the silver-eyed man to propel a spike of solid ice into its skull, killing it instantly. The spellchucker crawled over to the gasping man, ignoring the pain in his shoulder. “Are you all right?”</p>

<p>The gasping man nodded, coughed, and pointed to the Incantifer’s bleeding shoulder. “I… I’m fine.” He gasped. “You actually look a lot worse than I do.”</p>

<p>“I appreciate your worry, but the wound is not as bad as it looks. However, if you have a magic item on your person, I can be in good health in a very short while.”</p>

<p>The gasping man frowned. “I’m afraid I don’t have any healing items for you cutter.”</p>

<p>“I have no need for items of healing, any magical item will do. Like that gem in your pocket, the one that lets you see invisible creatures.”</p>

<p>The gasping man was worried. How did he know what I had? And that accent sounds familiar, but…</p>

<p>The man slipped the gem out of his pocket, and handed it to the man with the silver eyes. Silver eyes, why is that important. I remember hearing something about silver eyes…</p>

<p>The man with the silver eyes took the gem, and felt it. Not just the gem itself, but the power held inside. He concentrated, and the gem became just another piece of rock, any trace of magic removed.</p>

<p>Just a moment afterward, his shoulder was fine, the crushed bone repaired, and the torn flesh replaced by newly grown skin.</p>

<p>Suddenly, the man on the ground realized the word that had escaped him. “You're an Incantifier!” he cried, and tried his best to crawl away.</p>

<p>The man with the silver eyes raised his hands and yelled, “Wait! If my faction and yours are opposed, I swear I will show you no trouble, not in these accursed lands. Whatever enemies we might be in Sigil, let that not carry here.”</p>

<p>The man stopped crawling away, and turned around. “You don’t know, do you?”</p>

<p>The Incantifier looked puzzled. “Know what?”</p>

<p>“The Incantifier’s are gone, dead or worse.”</p>

<p>The man with the silver eyes was taken aback, before his face being distorted by rage. “How? When?” The Incantifier yelled.</p>

<p>“I don’t know the specifics, but they challenged The Lady, and were punished for it. It was a long time ago, it must have been hundreds of years before the great upheaval, at least!”</p>

<p>The Incantifier faltered. “Great upheaval?”</p>

<p>“Sorry friend, but I can’t be around you. I don’t want to be on the same plane as you when the Lady decides to come calling.”</p>

<p>The Incantifier was frantic now. “Why? Why would she come for me?”</p>

<p>“Because you’re a bloody Incantifier!”</p>

<p>“So what? I pose her, nor Sigil, any threat.”</p>

<p>The man was silent.</p>

<p>“And from the looks of it, neither of us are in the right condition to cross the Gray Waste alone. Without help, it’s not likely that either of us will live to see the Ladies shadow.”</p>

<p>The man shuddered. “Friend, that might be a good thing.”</p>

<p>They sat in silence for a few minuets, before the Incantifier broke the quiet.</p>

<p>“So, what is your name?”</p>

<p>“Aral, of the Believers of the Source. And you?”</p>

<p>“My name is Zalke Beri.”</p>

<p>"Well Zal, I hate to be the one to tell you this, but next time you summon a fiend, you should at least set up some way to protect yourself first."</p>

<p>Zalke was dumbstruck. "I didn't summon any fiend."</p>

<p>"Of course you did. How else did that Nycaloth and I get here?" Aral said, matter-of-factly.</p>

<p>"The Nycaloth spotted me from overhead, and I didn't have anyplace to hide."</p>

<p>Not it was Aral's turn to be confused. "But, then how did I get here? Just a little while ago, I was being thrashed by a 'loth, said I hadn't kept up my end of the bar... well, that parts not important. But then he had one of his cronies hold me down, damn Nycaloth grabbed me by the throat, hence the gasping, when 'flash' and I'm sitting next to a confused Nycaloth. You explain it then."</p>

<p>Zalke just hung his head. "I'm afraid the tables have turned, my friend. Now it is you who are uninformed."</p>

<p>"How so?" Aral asked.</p>

<p>"You have been imprisoned inside of a Yugoloth soulstone, as have I. A considerable amount of time has elapsed since my imprisonment, and I would assume that the same can be said of you. You were released when your soulstone, unfortunately crushed by the Nycaloth." Zalke managed to roll over the dead Nycaloth, and pointed to the crushed remains of a red gem. "And there is its remains."</p>

<p>Aral looked around. "If that’s true, then we should move. Now. If that Nycaloth was on patrol, they'll be missing him soon. Come on, we can talk on the way." Aral got to his feet, brushed himself off, and picked up the Nycaloth's axe. "By the way, would you happen to have any water?"</p>

<p>A look of worry crossed Zalke's face. "I am afraid that I do not. In fact, I have no food or water of any sort. I don't need any, you see."</p>

<p>"Damn, well then, lets hurry. I don't want to be on this damnable plane any longer than I have to. So, where’s the portal you’re looking for?" Aral asked.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately, I do not have any portals in mind. I do not even know our location, aside from the Waste. The only portal I have yet seen was a portal to the Abyss."</p>

<p>Aral paused for a moment. "You wouldn't happen to have any spells of flight, would you?"</p>

<p>Zalke sighed. "I have none prepared, but I do have a scroll of levitation, I believe."</p>

<p>"Good, good. That will work just as well. Cast it on me."</p>

<p>"What for? It only allows vertical movement." Zalke asked.</p>

<p>"Because, from up there," Aral pointed at the sky. "I might be able to spot a landmark. If so, then I think I can lead us to a portal out. I hate to admit, but I've had dealings on the Waste before."</p>

<p>Zalke nodded. "Very well then." He took a bundle of parchment from his belt, unrolled it, and scanned through the pages before finally selecting one. He drew a circle within a triangle on the ground. "Step inside, and be careful to not smudge the lines."</p>

<p>As Aral entered the circle, he became disoriented as he suddenly found himself floating. He closed his eyes, and willed himself up.</p>

<p>He felt like he was falling, but away from the ground. He opened his eyes, and looked around for any landmarks.</p>

<p>The Gray Waste spanned out before him. The bleakest shade of gray imaginable, in all directions. Faintly, off in the distance, he could make out a tiny line of color against the gray, dark red or maybe black.</p>

<p>And, much closer, a few dots of green, growing bigger.</p>

<p>Aral cursed, pulled out a couple of copper pieces, and tossed them to the ground ahead of him, before willing himself down.</p>

<p>"Nycaloths!" he cried, stepping from the circle and breaking the spell.</p>

<p>"Where?" Zalke asked.</p>

<p>"Three of them, flying from that direction." Aral said, pointing out the oncoming fiends.</p>

<p>"Did you notice any landmarks, do you know where we are?" Zalke asked hurriedly.</p>

<p>"No, but it doesn't matter." Aral replied, sifting through the gray dirt. "Because, I spotted the Styx, and it's in..." He picked up a copper piece and smiled. "This direction."</p>

<p>Zalke grabbed the pack full of soulstones and started running. "We must cover as much ground as possible, I have a plan."</p>

<p>"What?" Aral asked, breaking into a run.</p>

<p>"Flee."</p>

<p>As they fled across the waste, the Nycaloths closed in overhead, searching for their comrade. It wasn't long before they spotted the body, and sent one of their number to examine the body. The other two stayed aloft, searching. In a span of seconds, they spotted Zalke and Aral, and changed their flight to pursue them.</p>

<p>Zalke stopped, and reached into his pack. He drew out a thin wire rod, and drew a large rectangle in the air, while mumbling arcane formulae.</p>

<p>As he finished, the rectangle glowed white and sizzled with power. "In, now." Zalke yelled. Aral, recognizing it as a variant of the Dimension Door spell, ran through, quickly followed by Zalke.</p>

<p>Once they reached the other side, the Dimension Door closed, and fizzled away. Zalke whispered another series of indecipherable words, and drew a pinch of dust from his belt. He through it into the air, and shouted the last syllable. The dust burst into a cloud of mist, which floated to the ground and seemed to condense around an invisible frame. The mist took the shape of a large horse, and solidified.</p>

<p>Zalke climbed onto the steed, and turned to Aral. "Come, we must hurry."</p>

<p>Aral shakily climbed onto the spectral mount, and no sooner was he on that it leapt forward into a run. As the steed raced toward the Styx, Zalke took a single piece of what looked like hair covered in some sort of gel. He mumbled to himself, and the hair glowed blue, then faded away.</p>

<p>"That will make us invisible from the air." Zalke said, grabbing a small pouch of dust. He leaned back, and poured it in a stream back the way they had come. "And this shall obscure our tracks."</p>

<p>"How long will we be invisible to them?" Aral asked.</p>

<p>"Not long enough to reach the Styx, of that I am certain. But with hope and luck it may be enough to convince the fiends that we either teleported far way, or left the plane entirely. Either will suffice, as it will mean their departure."</p>

<p>They road on in silence, as fast as their mount could carry them. During the hours that past, Zalke could feel the soul numbing pull of the waste increase. Aral, tired and thirsty, fell asleep on the spectral mounts back.</p>

<p>He awoke to find himself lying on the ground, with Zalke sitting a few feet away, keeping watch.</p>

<p>"Don't you ever sleep?" Aral asked.</p>

<p>"No." Came the reply.</p>

<p>"How far?" Aral asked, licking his dry lips.</p>

<p>"The Styx is still a full days ride ahead of us. However, I have prepared a series of Dimension Door spells which will lessen the distance to a few hours to that rivers vile banks."</p>

<p>"Speaking of which," Aral said. "When we reach Sigil, we're going to have to pass you off as a poet, with the way you rattle."</p>

<p>There was a pause before Zalke spoke. "What was the great upheaval?"</p>

<p>Aral took a breath. "Long time ago, four hundred years last time I checked, probably longer now, there were a sodding lot of factions, the Incantarium among them. I think the Incantifiers got themselves mazed before the upheaval, but either way, all the factions kept quarreling like imps and quasits. There was probably something to trigger it, if there was I never learned it, but one day the Lady has the Dabus tell each and every factions that one way or the other, there would be only fifteen factions in Sigil."</p>

<p>"Well, sure as the spire all the factions start fighting. Some ran away, a couple broke up, and a few joined together. I think that’s where the Mercykillers came from, but in a week there were only fifteen factions left. The believers of the Source among them. You'll have plenty of time to get to learn about the new ones.”</p>

<p>"More time than you know." Zalke replied.</p>

<p>"So, I meant to ask you before, but I fell asleep. Exactly why are your carrying around all those Soulstones?" Aral asked, gesturing toward the bag.</p>

<p>"I found them after I was released." Zalke said. "I could not leave them to be discovered by the hags, so I took as many as I could."</p>

<p>"Yea, and you can buy a fortune for those on the right market." Aral pointed out.</p>

<p>"What?" Zalke said, disgusted. "How can you say such a thing after being imprisoned in one yourself? No, I plan to free them, once we reach safety."</p>

<p>"Why not do it now?"</p>

<p>"That was my original plan, however, I am afraid that many of them may have been mortally wounded or tortured before being imprisoned. The first soul I freed had been horribly burned; I had to take his life to end his suffering. No, I refuse to release them until I find a competent cleric."</p>

<p>Aral coughed. "Anyway, we need to get going. I'm not sure how much longer I can travel without water."</p>

<p>"Actually, I may have a temporary solution." Zalke said. "But first, do you have a container? A mug, or perhaps a metal flask?"</p>

<p>Aral pulled out a tin bowl. "Will this do?" He asked.</p>

<p>"Perfectly." Zalke said, taking the bowl. He mumbled an incantation, and a spike of ice formed in the air. But rather that be propelled forward, it fell into the bowl.</p>

<p>"Now, I think you may wish to use the sword of yours to help it melt. Unless you want to wait...” Zalke said, leaving the sentence unfinished.</p>

<p>"Someday, I'm going to find out how you always know what I have." Aral mumbled, pulling out his saber. He held it over the bowel and whispered the command word. The blade glowed yellow, and then burst into flame. Soon, the bowl was filled with water. Aral tossed aside his blade, and eagerly drained the bowel of its contents.</p>

<p>"Oh, that’s good." He said. "You wouldn't happen to have more, would you?"</p>

<p>"I’m afraid not. I spent much of my time preparing our means of transport." Zalke said. "Can you now travel?"</p>

<p>"Yes, as long as we reach a town or tavern soon, and I might just risk a 'loth bar by the time we get there. I'm telling you, first thing I do when I get back to the foundry is commission a Decanter of Endless Water."</p>

<p>"Doesn't a foundry typically forge metal?" Zalke asked, drawing a glowing rectangle in the air.</p>

<p>"Then let them make it out of metal!" Aral cried.</p>

<p>The spell finished, and they stepped through the doorway, it collapsing into a cloud of static behind them.</p>

<p>They emerged from the dimension door with the Styx in sight, though still a ways off. The continued their journey on foot, again being forced to take cover as a Nycaloth flew overhead.</p>

<p>Finally, they reached the vile, blood-like river Styx. Clouds of mist hung over it in patches. It was into these patches of mist the Zalke stared.</p>

<p>"An Oarsman will be here soon, of that I am sure. Ready you moneypouch, a ride in the Oarsman's skiff is not free, and not cheap if you want your memories to survive the voyage."</p>

<p>Aral hung his head sheepishly. "I'm afraid I don't have much jink, didn't have much on me when the 'loths got me. You?"</p>

<p>"Nor I. One does not carry money onto the field of battle. That serves no purpose but to pay the looters."</p>

<p>"I have... a gold piece and four silvers." Aral said, counting his coins.</p>

<p>"Don't even try and pay with silver. It is painful for fiends to touch, and this is not the time to anger our only mode of transport."</p>

<p>"So, one gold piece then."</p>

<p>"That’s the least we need to actually call one, I think." Zalke said, taking the gold piece. He walked over to the black, frothing river and held his hand out above it.</p>

<p>He held it there for a few moments before one of the clouds of fog flickered, and the water rippled, as if someone had dropped in a large rock, except that there was no splash.</p>

<p>A large, flat-bottomed skiff sailed out of the fog, a thin figure in a large dark blue robe at the helm. Although the Oarsman's pole was in the water, it was only just dipped in, and the boat seemed to guide itself to the shore.</p>

<p>The figure turned toward Zalke, exposing the skeletal face of a Marraenoloth.</p>

<p>"Child of Charon, we seek transport by means of the Styx. Will you grant us passage on your skiff?" Zalke said, reciting the ritual.</p>

<p>The skeletal figure paused for a moment, and suddenly began to shake. A wheezy, rattling cough filled the air, and it took both Aral and Zalke a moment to realize that the fiend was actually laughing.</p>

<p>"Well met, traveler. This skiff would carry you, for a price." The voice rasped.</p>

<p>"I’m afraid, Oarsman, that we have but one gold piece between us, and we wish not to pay you in silver. What other means could we seek to buy ourselves passage?"</p>

<p>"There are currencies other than gold in the lower planes." The Marraenoloth rasped.</p>

<p>Zalke, confused, looked back at Aral.</p>

<p>"He means soulstones." Aral said.</p>

<p>"But, I can not give away another's soul..." Zalke said.</p>

<p>"Than we have to find another way off this plane, and by then I'll have died of dehydration." Aral replied curtly.</p>

<p>Zalke hung his head, and mournfully reached into his pouch. He pulled forth an amber colored stone, a little smaller than a fist. "I am sorry." He whispered to the soul trapped inside, then turned back to face the fiend.</p>

<p>"Will this meet your price?" Zalke asked, proffering the stone.</p>

<p>"Indeed." The Oarsman replied, taking the stone. "Step aboard my skiff." The fiends red eyes flashed as he stepped aside, making way for the Incantifier.</p>

<p>As Zalke stepped past, the Marraenoloth resumed his stance of blocking access to the boat. "Your price has not been paid." It said, speaking now to Aral.</p>

<p>"I don't have any gold." Aral said.</p>

<p>Although the fiend made no movement, the skiff started to pull away from the shore.</p>

<p>"Wait!" Aral yelled. The skiff stopped. "I have these."</p>

<p>The Aasimar opened his hand, revealing four silver pieces. The Marraenoloth moved the skiff back into place, and took the silver pieces, hissing as he grasped them.</p>

<p>After Aral had boarded the skiff, the Marraenoloth dipped his pole in the water, and the small boat moved away from the shore. It slowly turned to face a could of fog up ahead.</p>

<p>"No one has bothered with the ritual of passage for a long time." The fiend began.</p>

<p>"It's only right to show respect" Zalke replied.</p>

<p>As the skiff the neared the mist cloud, the oarsman spoke. "What is your destination?"</p>

<p>"A safe haven, near a portal to either The Outlands, or Sigil." Zalke replied</p>

<p>"Or someplace else that I can get a drink." Aral said.</p>

<p>The ferryman turned his head back to face Aral. "There is no need for thirst here, feel free to drink as much of the surrounding water as you like."</p>

<p>The Marraenoloth began his wheezing laugh again, more at the look of disgust on Aral's face than at his own joke. The skiff entered the cloud of mist, and the laughter faded off into the distance. When the mist cleared, there was no boat in sight.</p>       </div>

          The Incantarium is dead, long live the Incantifiers        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Chapter 3</span></p>

<p>On the fire-scarred plane of Avernus, a cloud of mist formed above dark, memory leeching waters. Barely audible, unheard by any fiend, one could hear a faint, raspy laugh. The cloud flickered, and the skiff slowly emerged from the fog. Soundlessly, it glided over to the shore.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Oarsman. Now, where is the portal?" Zalke asked.</p>

<p>"On this shore lies a broken tower. On what was the third floor is a window that, given the proper key, will take you to Sigil." The Marraenoloth replied, slowly moving away from the bank.</p>

<p>"But what’s the key?" Aral asked.</p>

<p>The 'loth ignored the question. It merely entered the fog bank, and vanished in a flicker.</p>

<p>"Damn." Aral said. He turned to see Zalke climbing over a pile of debris. "Our portal lies this way." Zalke yelled.</p>

<p>Sure enough, the debris was the broken foundation of an iron tower, once used as a watchtower to guard the Styx.</p>

<p>They climbed inside the ruined base of the structure, and crawled along the wall.</p>

<p>"Aw, Lady's Blades." Aral exclaimed. "The stairway up is on its side. No way we're getting to the next floor from the inside."</p>

<p>They returned back the way they had come, and walked alongside the broken tower, looking for an entrance. When they reached the fourth row of windows, they finally found one large enough to pass through. The way down from the fourth floor was a rotten wooden trapdoor, which easily gave way with a push.</p>

<p>Aral quickly searched the room for windows. There were several smaller windows, and two larger ones, which a person might climb through. However, one was on the roof, while the other was pressed into the dirt.</p>

<p>"So, now what?" Aral said. "It's the window on the bottom, that much I know, but we still don't know the key."</p>

<p>Zalke walked over to the window, and started to mumble. He made complex gestures and finished by drawing in the air a downward spiral. The room seemed more vibrant for a moment, before the feeling faded.</p>

<p>"The key is a puncture on the third and fourth finger of the left hand, made by the spike of a Spinagon."</p>

<p>"That specific, eh?" Aral said. "Well, at least we're on Baator. That should make finding a Spinagon easier."</p>

<p>"Finding a lone Spinagon can prove difficult. But there is another way." Zalke said. Again, he mumbled arcane syllables, only this time he sprinkled a white power on the floor, forming a circle. Zalke stepped back, and handed Aral a slip of paper inscribed with arcane runes.</p>

<p>"When I tell you to, throw this into the middle of the circle." Zalke said.</p>

<p>Zalke pointed at the circle, and made a series of complex motions with his other hand. "Now!" he yelled.</p>

<p>Aral tossed the slip of paper, and as it entered the circle of powder it ignited in a burst of green flame.</p>

<p>The flame began to take the form of a small, winged humanoid. It wasn't until the flames faded away that the spikes became apparent.</p>

<p>The Spinagon had a brief moment of freedom after being summoned before being assaulted by Zalke's mental attack. Within moments, the lesser fiend's mental defenses fell before the enchantment. Hardly trustworthy, but now guaranteed to treat them as allies, the Spinagon spoke.</p>

<p>"What is it you what of me?" It hissed.</p>

<p>"All I need of you is a single spike." Zalke said. "I have no time for Demonology, so you will be released from my hold over you as soon as we leave this plane."</p>

<p>The Spinagon hissed, and fired a spike from its torso, landing hardly an inch from Zalke's feet. The fiend was unable to harm them, but it could still show its anger at its imprisonment.</p>

<p>Zalke, completely unfazed, picked up the spike. "Thank you, fiend."</p>

<p>Zalke pricked the third and fourth fingers of his left hand with the spike. As he made the second puncture, the window below him shimmered. The ground beneath it became hazy, and the unique smell of Sigil wafted up.</p>

<p>"Aral, you first." Zalke commanded.</p>

<p>The Aasimar leapt into the portal. From the other side, Zalke could barely discern a yell. "Farewell fiend." Zalke said, before stepping into the window.</p>

<p>And then fell on his back as he hoizantilly dropped through a window in what appeared to be someone's house.</p>

<p>Zalke suppressed a grunt of pain, and spotted Aral nearby. The Aasimar was getting to his feet, and was holding a finger to his lips. As the portal closed behind them, Aral pointed downwards. Almost as if on que, Zalke heard the sound of footsteps going up stairs, and voices arguing.</p>

<p>"By the hell's woman! No one breaks into homes during the peak hours! And you always complain about the soddin razorvine on that wall. Who do you think is going to climb that?"</p>

<p>"I'm telling you Jarn, I heard something." A woman said.</p>

<p>"Fine, then, I’ll check it. But you’ll feel damn silly when you see that there’s…" The door burst open, leaving all parties momentarily speechless.</p>

<p>"I realize how bad this must look..." Aral began.</p>

<p>"Not as bad as you're going to look in a few moments." The man roared, waving what looked like an old table leg.</p>

<p>"No! Please, we aren’t here to steal anything, I swear!" the Aasimar replied frantically.</p>

<p>The man sat there and fumed for a moment. "Millie, check the other rooms, tell me if you find anything missing."</p>

<p>A few awkward minuets later, 'Millie' returned. "Everything seems to be in its proper place."</p>

<p>"Thank you Millie." The man replied. Suddenly he resumed his shouting. "Now! Tell me why the two of your are in my guest bedroom!"</p>

<p>Zalke decided now might be the time for some diplomacy. "Sir, you window here is the receiving end of a portal from Baator, I hate to have intruded in your home, but we could find no other alternative. If you only let us leave in peace, we will trouble you no more."</p>

<p>Jarn seemed to think for a moment, before slowly lowering his club.<br />
"All right then, out, now. But no funny stuff." He waved the club in a somewhat menacing fashion.</p>

<p>"Agreed." Zalke replied.</p>

<p>Aral sheepishly raised his hand. "I know this might be a bad time, but could you possible spare a drink of water?"</p>

<p>-----------------------------</p>

<p>Back on Avernus, a lone Spinagon flew over the flame-scorched plane toward the city of Dis. But even though the lesser fiend knew that it would be punished for leaving its post, its face sported a wicked smile.</p>

<p>Because his Osyluth commander would be pleased with the information this Spinagon had gathered. Maybe even glad enough not to beat him senseless for having the misfortune of being summoned halfway across the plane.</p>

<p>------------------------------</p>

<p>"Wait for it..." Aral whispered.</p>

<p>The collector left his wagon, stepping into an alley to snatch a corpse.</p>

<p>"Wait here" He said, sneaking out of the alley.</p>

<p>Aral darted up to the cart, and started to rummage around the bodies. "Aha!" he exclaimed after finding his prize.</p>

<p>"Oy, berk!" The collector yelled. "Pike off, this is m' wagon and m' corpses. Go grab yer'own!"</p>

<p>Aral bolted back toward Zalke, clutching a small object in his hand. "Here." In his hand was a greasy set of dark tinted goggles, held in place with a thin leather strap.</p>

<p>"Put these on, or everyone in Sigil's going to be able to see your eyes. And trust me, the ones most interested in an Incantifier these days are not the kind of people you want to be around."</p>

<p>Zalke did his best to wipe off the grime before donning his new eyewear.</p>

<p>"Uh, it makes you look like a bug." Aral said. "But as long as you keep up the act of having light sensitive eyes, no one will bother you too much."</p>

<p>"Thank you." Zalke replied. He hefted his bag full of soulstones. "So, where may I find a healer? I do not feel safe carrying the prized fortune of a fiend."</p>

<p>"The ones you want will be at the Gatehouse, Sigil's barmycage. It's run by a group called the Bleak Cabal. They aren’t the most enthusiastic bunch in Sigil, so make sure you find a lively one before you start freeing souls." Aral looked around. “They're in that bat winged building over there." Aral said, point at an area of the Hive far enough away that he was pointing at an angel up. "Well, I have to go report with my faction, good luck! And remember, if you need help just find a tout."</p>

<p>"I remember touts, they had them in my day as well." Zalke replied.</p>

<p>Aral smiled, and ran off toward the Lower Ward.</p>

<p>Zalke turned, and began searching for the building Aral had described. He sighed. Sigil had changed. It was still a torus floating above the spire, Dabus still patrolled the streets and the Hive was still a slum. Although, a larger slum than Zalke remembered.<br />
The changes were subtle. Where once factotums could be seen standing on raised platforms and preaching the ideology of their faction, there were simply bands of thugs. The Tower Sorcerous was no longer a part of the Sigilian skyline, and there seemed to be more fiends than he remembered.</p>

<p>Zalke made his way through the crowds of planetouched, careful to stay away from the pools of ooze in the street. The sight of the bladed buildings, the sounds of several different planar languages mixing together, even the smells of the creatures and foods of a thousand worlds told him he was home. But this wasn't the Sigil he had left.</p>

<p>For him, the City of Doors had changed in a matter of months, not centuries. When he was last in the City of Doors, it was just before he made that deal with Fazerg of Dis. When he had promised himself to a decade of service in the Blood War for a rare tome of magic, containing spells which he believed could launch him to the highest echelons of the Incantarium.</p>

<p>He was a different person then. A true practitioner of the Incantifier way. Magic is power, magic is life. His greed for arcane might had blinded him into believing that he could survive the blood war. A decade was merely a moment in the life of a person who can not age. And the Baatazue, at least, would honor their bargain. They had to; it was their nature.</p>

<p>The first skirmish had quashed his ideas of superiority. He was cannon fodder, fighting for his life now, and it was only his powers as an Incantifier that had saved him from death by the skin of his teeth, time and time again.</p>

<p>Until that last battle. When the Balor's death throes had wiped out the entire Barbazu attack force, and sent a Barbazu glaive flying into his stomach. If it had hit him just a little higher, he wouldn't have survived long enough to be 'rescued' by the Hags.</p>

<p>But all that was irrelevant now. Zalke was alive; his term in the blood war was over. And now he could finally free some of the other trapped souls. Vainly, he hoped that there might be another Incantifier in one of the soulstones he carried. Eternity when among other immortals was one thing, spending eternity alone was another matter entirely.</p>

<p>As Zalke rounded the corner, he noticed something... odd. He took another step. There it was again, something didn't sound right. Ever since he left that cavern on the waste, every step had been accompanied by the sound of gems rubbing against each other. But at some point, it had stopped.</p>

<p>Terrified at what he might find, Zalke opened his bag and sifted through the scrolls he had packed on top to cover the soulstones from watchful eyes. He felt something hard and cold, but altogether the wrong texture.<br />
Zalke pulled out a rock. A simple, everyday cobblestone.<br />
The soulstones were gone.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Zalke looked around frantically, searching the crowd. Aral was the only one who could have taken them. If they were merely missing, it might have been a common thief. But they had been replaced. But when did he do it, and how?<br />
As if it mattered now. Aral was probably on his way back to his faction, ready to split his riches with the rest of the so-called 'Believers of the Source.'<br />
Wait, the foundry. Zalke turned, and looked across the ring at the lower ward. Aral had mentioned the foundry. And all the little smithies had been in the lower ward. At the very least it was a place to start looking, someone there must know where the foundry was.<br />
Zalke dropped the cobblestone in disgust, and broke into a run. As he neared the lower ward, he caught a whiff of a noxious smell, some horrible poison smog in the air. He broke out into a rack of coughing before deciding to stop breathing altogether. It was only a habit at this point anyway. Back into a run, Zalke soon found himself in the middle a district full of metalshops. And right in the middle of it, a giant building pumping out clouds of the smog Zalke has encountered earlier. That had to be the foundry.</p>

<p>Zalke stopped for a moment, and calmed himself. Don't be hasty, you have all the time in the world.<br />
Zalke walked up to one of the guards. Odd, for a faction headquarters this place didn't seem too well defended.<br />
"Greetings." Zalke began. "I am looking for a friend of mine, Aral. I have reason to believe that he would be here."<br />
The guard stared at Zalke for a moment. "People visit the foundry every day, berk. I’ll need a bit more to go on." The guard said.<br />
“A short man, of celestial bloodlines. He has blue eyes, and golden skin.”<br />
“Oh, him.” <br />
"I need to speak with him. Is here still here?" Zalke asked, trying to hide his relief.<br />
"Afraid not, sir. Poor sod hadn't heard about the Faction War, still thought the Godsmen were around. I sent him to the Hall of Records."<br />
Zalke was stunned for a moment, then burst out laughing. The guard, unable to discern what was so amusing, asked, "Sir?"<br />
Zalke, in between laughs, managed. "Nothing, just that the planes turn in mysterious ways." Zalke, after a few more moments of laughter at the irony of the situation, said "Thank you." And ran off in the direction of the Clerks Ward, a smile on his face. It wasn't until he rounded the last corner that he caught sight of the Hall. It was defiantly still the Hall of Records, just not the same building that Zalke had known. It had been expanded, now at least twice the size he remembered, and part of it looked as if it had been replaced. But the heart of the structure was most defiantly the same building. And the lines of people (and other creatures that Zalke could only assume were 'people') running outside the building were an obvious clue. Zalke weaved his way through the crowd, before finally spotting Aral. He was sitting on the massive stairs, his face unmistakably forlorn as he read through a booklet. As Zalke approached, Aral stood up with a shout, and backed up against the wall.</p>

<p>"Wasn't expecting you so soon." Aral said, surprisingly calm.</p>

<p>"Where are the stones?" Zalke asked.</p>

<p>"Right here. You can have them." Aral said, tossing a pouch to Zalke. "You'll find that they're all there. Now if you don't mind, I going to get a drink, this time something stronger then water."</p>

<p>Zalke, confused, found himself following Aral through the clerks ward. It wasn't long before Zalke recognized the path. They were heading back to the lower ward.</p>

<p>A few minuets later, Aral walked into a tavern, just a few blocks away from the foundry. Zalke, still silent in his befuddlement, followed him in.</p>

<p>Aral sat down at the bar and sighed. "Ysguardian Ale." He said. The barkeep, a Shad, scurried off to fetch the drink.</p>

<p>Zalke sat down beside him. "Aral, exactly what just happened? I think I'm mad at you, but right now I’m not sure."</p>

<p>"Oh, you're mad at me all right. You should be. I stole from you and you have every right to blast off my hands or something. Go ahead, see if I care." The Shad set down the glass of ale, and started to walk away before Aral quickly grabbed the glass, drained its contents, and slammed the glass back down on the counter. "More please."</p>

<p>The wide-eyed Shad blinked, then shrugged and went to fetch more ale. "I used to come here all the time. Hells, whole block used to be owned and operated by Godsmen. Was run by a Shad back then too, Tasperoo. Funny, I just bought the same drink as usual, but from his great grandson." The barkeep set down another drink, this time holding a large bottle of ale in his other hand. Aral grabbed up the drink, and held it high. "To Tasperoo!" and then downed it's contents. Aral sat there for a moment. "Okay, I think I'm done."</p>

<p>"Why did you take the soulstones?" Zalke asked, trying to sound threatening.</p>

<p>"I thought I needed them. There were a few debts to some particularly nasty fiends that got me trapped in that gem in the first place. I figured that with those soulstones, I could buy myself out of debt, and guarantee that the loth's would leave me alone for a while. I still thought that I was in the same time period as when I went in, you know?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I do. Upon my freedom, I also assumed that little time had passed since my imprisonment. I was also under the impression that the group of unaging comrades with which I am associated would still exist. I was proven wrong twice."</p>

<p>"Well, by now the 'loth I was working with won’t care that I’m back. It’s been over a hundred and twenty years since I was last in Sigil. Speaking of which, without the Godsmen, I'm going have to find a real job. Bugger."</p>

<p>Aral got up, and started to walk away, when the barkeep yelled. "Hey Berk! You didn't pay for your drinks!"</p>

<p>Aral turned. "What are you talking about? Godsmen always get fre..." His eyes went wide. "Hells. Ummm... fine, here's your money." Aral reached for his pouch and drew out a small package of powder, and threw it into the air. Suddenly the room was filled with a sparkling, golden haze. Zalke watch as the entire crowd inside the bar, including the Shad, turned to look, and began to stare in opened mouth awe.</p>

<p>"Run!" Aral whispered harshly. Zalke followed him outside, and they began to walk at a fast pace away from the bar.</p>

<p>"That should keep them occupied for a little while. Hopefully, the Shad wont care enough to actually notify the Harmonium or whoever it is that runs this place now. Powers above, I have no idea what’s going on anymore."</p>

<p>"I have felt that way ever since we arrived." Zalke replied.</p>

<p>--------------<br />
In Baator, in an iron tower near the middle of Dis, a Spinagon who had very recently been on Avernus explained what it had learned. The only other occupant of the room was a fearsome creature with no flesh, its entire body made of bone. The creature’s barbed tail twitched in anticipation.<br />
H'sruthk sat, and listened as the Spinagon spoke. Normally, it would have already had the lesser fiend dipped in holy water for leaving his post, and beaten it for daring to speak to him without first being addressed. But the Spinagon's tale was intriguing, if short. And if the despicable creature was telling the truth, then there was an opportunity here, one which must be exploited, and quickly.<br />
"Is that all?" The Osyluth asked.<br />
"Yes." The Spinagon replied meekly.<br />
The Osyluth's tail leapt into action, and ripped a gaping hole in the lesser fiend's throat. With a strangled gasp of surprise, the Spinagon fell to the floor. The Osyluth brought down its foot, and the Spinagon died with a terrible crunch.<br />
"Thank you, for your honesty." The Osyluth said to the corpse. H'sruthk always had been one of the more sentimental of his kind.<br />
The Bone Devil turned around and walked toward the gate to Avernus. There were plans to be made.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

Is going to the Gatehouse still a viable option? I dont know if there are still any useful clerics floating around there. </p>

<p>What about the upper planes? They actually seem like an obvious choice, now that I think about it. Some of them have healing magics, they dont care about angering the fiends (well, some of them don't at any rate) and they would probably do it for free since its a good act.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Chapter 5</p>

<p>As Aral walked through the Lower ward, again he took the book out of his pouch. It was a leather bound tome, which looked like had been handled often. A metal plate bolted onto the front had the engraving <span style="font-style:italic">Sigil: After the Factions</span>. Aral flipped through a few pages, then looked up at Zalke.</p>

<p>"So, I haven't quite finished reading this book about the faction war I picked up, so we might want to stay away from Sigil for a bit." Aral said.</p>

<p>"You told me that you had no currency, how did you afford the book?" Zalke asked. The question had been plauging him since after they left the bar.</p>

<p>"I never said I bought it, I said I picked it up." Aral replied. </p>

<p>"Fine then. Never mind the means of aquisition, what course of action do you suggest?" Zalke asked.</p>

<p>"Well, what we need is a healer, one willing to do it as cheaply as possible, and has no qualms with angering the fiends. I say we head to the Upper Planes. There has to be plently of Celestials up there that can help us." Aral replied.</p>

<p>"Aasimon. I know that some of them have healing powers. Finding one of them should be relativly easy." Zalke said.</p>

<p>"Fine. Aasmon it is. But I refuse to go to Ysguard. Kord and I arn't on the best of terms." Aral said.</p>

<p>"What of Arborea?"</p>

<p>"That will do fine. In fact, I know a portal that can take use there, its not too far from here, in fact. However, we need a freshly cut plant." Aral said.</p>

<p>"I have no such plant on my person, and we have no currency, so..." Zalke  looked over to a nearby wall.</p>

<p>Aral followed his gaze. "Oh, powers above. You can't be serious." </p>

<p>The brick wall surrounding that they stared at was covered with a black, twisting vine. Its leaves the shape of hearts and its stems the stuff of local legend. As Aral looked at it, he imagined he could actually see dried blood on it. </p>

<p>"Razorvine?" He asked.</p>

<p>"It's a plant. And we do not need much of it. Just a single piece."  Zalke replied. </p>

<p>"Fine. But not yet, we have to take it from near the portal." Aral looked around. "You notice something?"</p>

<p>"No, I do not." Zalke replied. </p>

<p>"There arn't any Dabus. I swear, I havn't seen you and a single Dabus on the same street." Aral said. "You think that's a bad sign?"</p>

<p>"It is likely not a good one." Zalke said.</p>

<p>"I want to try something." Aral said. "Wait here. Come when you see me wave."</p>

<p>Aral walked to the intersection ahead, and looked around. He waved his hand in the air, and Zalke walked over.</p>

<p>"Yep. They're avoiding you all right. As soon as you started coming this way, I saw three Dabus just pack up and go. Maybe they think that you got something against the Lady." Aral said.</p>

<p>"Maybe, but if that was true, why would she not maze me now and have done with it?" Zalke asked.</p>

<p>"Probably because you haven't actually done anything yet." Aral said. "Come on, the portal to Arborea is this way."</p>

<p>Zalke followed Aral through the hazy streets of Sigil, watching the crowds of cagers. He kept getting stares from the locals, and for a moment Zalke paniced and worried that they might be able to see his eyes. But his hand confirmed that the goggles were still in place. His identity was still hidden. </p>

<p>"Here we are." Aral said, ducking into a nearby alley. </p>

<p>Zalke followed him in, and saw Aral stareing at a large pot hole, filled with murky water. </p>

<p>"Okay, time for the Razorvine." Aral said looking around. He spied some of the despicable vine starting to crawl downward from the roof, most of it a tangle in the gutter of the shop. </p>

<p>"Hmm, we'll have to get it down from..." Aral was cut off as the rasorvine suddenly leapt into the air, and started to writhe as though in a struggle with some invisible opponent. The vine twisted, and then broke with a snap. The detached length of razorvine drifted downward, before stoping a few feet above the ground.</p>

<p>Zalke was standing with his arms folded in a relaxed position. "Telekenisis solves all problems."</p>

<p>"Well then, could you move it closer to the portal? It hasn't opened yet." Aral said.</p>

<p>With a wave of his hand, Zalke sent the coil of razorvine floating over the pothole. There was no effect.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm such a berk. It has to be cut, not broken off. Hold it steady." Aral said, pulling out his saber. With a well placed strike, the coil of vine was cut neatly in half. Again, there was no effect. </p>

<p>"Well... blast. I guess the portal must have been blocked on the other side, or something. There's another portal to the Upper Planes I know, it's in the Hive though. And it leads to Bytopia, but the portal key is simple enough."</p>

<p>Zalke shrugged, and the two halves of razorvine dropped into the puddle. As Zalke turned to walk away, Aral cried out.</p>

<p>"What do you think your doing? You can't just leave that Razorvine there! This time next Voidsday, this entire alley will be covered with the stuff. It grows fast enough as it is, don't encourage it with all that water." Aral grumbed as he attempted to spear one of the vines with his sword, with little success. </p>

<p>Zalke sighed and mumbed a couple indecphierable words, and with a wave of his hand the two vines burst into flames. Aral leapt back in surprise. Before his feet hit the ground again, all that was left in the puddle was ash. </p>

<p>"It will not grow now." Zalke said. </p>

<p>Aral sighed. "Lets just go to the Hive."</p>

<p>---------------------------</p>

<p>"Powers be damned!" Aral yelled. He stood in front of the cracked stone wall, where two seperate fissures in the stone ran vertically and then joined. Aral again tried the portal key, holding his tumb between his middle and ring fingers. But there was no effect. No shimmer at all. </p>

<p>"This one should still work. It leads to an tunnel in the Bytopian sewers. I can't imagine why it would be blocked off." Arak exclaimed. "I guess that we're stuck with the Bleakers, for now at least." </p>

<p>As Aral led Zalke through the Hive he whispered. "Watch out, we haven't gone unnoticed."</p>

<p>"Who?" Zalke asked in return.</p>

<p>Aral twitched his head off to the left. Zalke look out of the corner of his eye. He saw a group of street urchins, huddled together and glancing in his direction. </p>

<p>"It's a bunch of kids." Zalke said.</p>

<p>"A bunch of orphens. In the Hive. I guarentee that they all have a shank on em. All because they're kids doesn't mean they can't slit your throat."</p>

<p>One of the childrn, who looked to be only four years old, tossed a rotten, mangy leather ball into the street. With a rather soggy sound, it hit the cobblestones and bounced in Zalke and Aral's direction. With a cheer, the children ran over in a playfull manner. </p>

<p>"Run!" Aral yelled, bolting down the street. Zalke thought the idea was utterly preposterous, before he caught the glint of something shiny in one of the childrens hands. Something metal...</p>

<p>In the blink of an eye, Zalke wasn't too far behind Aral.</p>

<p>Aral rounded the corner, and then slowed to a jog, waiting for Zalke to catch up. As the Incantifier rounded the corner, he stopped next to the panting Aral. "How much farther to the Gatehouse?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Not far, it's just around the bend." Aral replied. </p>

<p>Zalke followed Aral through the crowd, almost bumping into a large red Slaad as he turned the corner. </p>

<p>"Pardon me." Zalke said as he stepped past.</p>

<p>"Not my saucey biscuts, my good man!" The Slaad yelled at the top of his lungs. Rather than actually do anything though, the Slaad just sat down in the street and began to sing about chicken modron-flavored bubbles.</p>

<p> Zalke slowly backed away toward Aral, who was laughing. "And thats why I love Slaad, as long as they ar'nt hungry." he said. "Come on, the Gatehouse is right over here. </p>

<p>Zalke turned around, and caught his first glance of the Gatehouse. A giant, rusted building, with what looked like bat wings on the top. A tower, slightly bent to the side, as if the Bat wings were unbalancing it. The outside of the building was in a shabby state of repair. Possibly still in working condition, but no sense of astetics whatsoever. The rusty iron gate was wide open, and a line of people stood outside. Some of them mumbled to themselves, or randomly burst into yells or cries. But all of them look depressed, lost. The ones that were obviously barmy kept trying to pull away, but were held in line by handlers. Some were guards wearing all white armor, others looked to be family members or friends, obviously torn up by the descision to place their loved ones in the Bleaker's apathetic care. And all of them slowly shuffled forward, as if in a forced march toward death itself.</p>

<p>For a moment, Zalke took in the building as a whole, and the bat wings ornementation on the top made the structure seem like a collosal monster, lulling its prey into walking right into its mouth. The feeling passed as he went to join Aral in the line. Zalke clutched the bag full of soulstones to his chest nervously. </p>

<p>Zalke and Aral shuffled forward with the rest of them, the people ahead of them being one of the white clad guards holding the arm of a scrawny young women with wild, frantic eyes.</p>

<p>After what felt like an hour of waiting, and only having moved a few meters ahead in line, Zalke heard a commotion.  He looked over and saw a young man, teifling perhaps, running down the street carrying a pouch that jingled with gold. Another man running after him, yelling. </p>

<p>The guard in white ahead turned to Aral, and shoved the girl at him. "Hold her." He said, taking off at a run. Aral, momentarily confused, grabbed the girls arm before she realizied what had happened, barely ducking the blow she aimed for his head.</p>

<p> The white clad guard ran across the street and blocked the pickpocket's path. "You will find no escape this way, my friend. return what you have..." The guard was cut off as the thief pulled out a hand crossbow, fired it, and ducked into an alley. </p>

<p>The guard in white dodged the bolt, nevertheless it cut a hole in his white cloak. He took off after the thief, this time his mace drawn. </p>

<p>"Bloody paladins. Never know when to quit." Aral said. The wild eyed women thrashed and tried to break away again. "And apperantly, neither do you. So, what did he grab you for?" He asked her.</p>

<p>The women let out a howl and started biting at the air. Aral looked at Zalke. "Can you do anything with her? Make her fall asleep, or more complacent," The women broke and arm free and tried to grap at Aral's sword. "or at least get her to stop trying to kill me?" </p>

<p>Zalke sighed, and placed his open palm on her forhead. There was a flash of puple light, and she went limp. Her wild eyes only half open, she looked scared and confused.</p>

<p>"She will be tired for some time now." Zalke said. "She may actually fall asleep on her own now, but her fatigue should at least make her less resistive." </p>

<p>There was a shuffling noise as the guard clad in white walked back to the line, dragging a sore leg. "Thank you kindl... what happened to her?" He asked, pointing at the women, who now had her tounge sticking out of her mouth, and kept drawing circles in the air with it.  </p>

<p>"Oh, well, she kept putting up a fight, so we made her a bit sleepy." Aral said. </p>

<p>"Well, I guess that works. Again, thank you." He said, then pointed at Zalke. "So, whats his condition?"</p>

<p>"I wasn't aware that I had a condition." Zalke replied. </p>

<p>"Oh, I am sorry." The guard said. "I thought that he was leading you to the Gatehouse to be committed. My mistake." the guard smiled. "No hard feelings, I hope?"</p>

<p>Zalke glared at the guard. In the old days, this knight of glory wouldn't dare make eye contact with him, for fear of being burnt alive by some spell. Zalke usually didn't try to intimidate others like many of the Incanterium did, but right now he wish he did have a fearsom reputation to his name, if only to see this man squirm.</p>

<p>"None, I assure you." Zalke replied. </p>

<p>Aral passed the wild eyed woman off to the guard in white, and rejoined Aral in line. He reached to his side, pulled out the book, and began to read.</p>

<p>The line slowly shuffled forward, and it wasn't long before, after hundreds of years, an Incantifier passed through the archway of the gatehouse.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">
