</div> <p>To aid in discussions elsewhere; I believe it is necessary to define the alignments of DnD.  These are my interpretations of the binary system; everyone feel free to argue against it and offer their intepretations.</p>

<p>Good is defined as helping others and otherwise seeing to and ensuring the well-being of others.  Mixed with this is the willingness to make personal sacrifices (whether of time, money, energy, or blood) for the sake of others.</p>

<p>Evil is defined as hurting others and the disregard for the well-being of others.  Mixed with this is the willingness to sacrifice others to yourself (by manipulating them, cheating them, stealing, or murdering).</p>

<p>Law is defined as restricting your behavior within a defined external code of conduct, prefering general order and well-defined boundaries, serving or being part of something greater than yourself, being logical and methodical in ones actions, and willingness to conform and be part of a group.</p>

<p>Chaos is defined as being impulsive and emotional in one's actions, not confining oneself to a code of conduct and rebelling against attempts to be so confined, individualism, refusal to conform, and willingness to leave things undefined.</p>       </div>

         <p>Ahh... but what do you call somebody who will do or sacrifice anything for their family and friends, showing genuine altruism for their children and parents and spouse, but disregards people outside of their social circle? Do "good" and "evil" cancel out to make that person Neutral?</p>

<p>What about somebody who values individuality and independance, but also  society and community? Would that be ethically Neutral?</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>For your latter point, the person would definitely be neutral by this system.  For your first point, things are a bit more complicated since the simplicity of DnD's alignment system is really not particularly good for dealing with contradictions.  If the said individual was simply apathetic regarding those outside of his circle he would be neutral in regards to good and evil.  But if was genuinely altruistic towards his friends and family but actively preyed upon those outside of his circle he would, in my eyes, "break the system" in regards to DnD alignment.  Of course in reality there were, and to some extent still are, many cultures that promoted altruism and the sort regarding those in your social circle or clan while at the same time firmly believing that those outside of the clan did not warrant any consideration and could be preyed upon (such as real world Vikings).</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Well, this is Planescape, so it makes perfect sense to define ethics by plane.  Morals fit into the cosmology in a very definitive way.  In a way, a planar scale replaces the alignments, by expanding on them.</p>

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>The simple fact that I've gleaned from countless (seriously, like, six) debates of this nature is that the D&amp;D alignments simply do not work in real life. They are inherently binary, whereas human conciousness is anything but. Similarly, there has never been an even half-decent set of parameters for alignment in the game that wasn't riddled with contradictions and vagueries.</p>

<p>Seriously, the definition of "good" that is given the PHB (roughly: kindness, empathy, and generosity) is totally different from the definition of "good" given in the <span style="font-style:italic">Book of Exalted Deeds</span> (basically, kicking the ever-loving crap out of evil-doers). Similarly, the <span style="font-style:italic">Book of Vile Darkness</span> would leave you thinking that in order to be evil you have to eat babies and turn villagers into ghouls, or, alternatively, just have a really nasty (not wicked, just gross) set of powers. Also, if you go by the "definitions" of "lawful" and "chaotic" given in the Core rules, and look at them carefully enough, you'll realize that <span style="font-style:italic">they are functionally identical!</span> Seriously, law and chaos are defined so broadly that they regularly overlap, and a Lawful character can always find a justification for breaking the rules, and a chaotic character for following them. Basically, it is up to the DM to actually figure out what alignments actually mean in a game, and even then they can be a righteous (no pun intended) mess.</p>

<p>For <span style="font-style:italic">a lot </span>more on the evils of alignment, see <a href="http://boards1.wizards.com/showthread.php?t=646241" class="bb-url">this</a> forum post and its accompanying discussion. I don't know about you, but I found it somewhat enlightening.</p>

<p>At any rate, the <span style="font-style:italic">first</span> question I typically ask myself when I'm considering starting a new campaign is "what do I do about alignment?" As the assigned reading will tell you, the way you handle alignment will set the tone for the entire campaign. Lately, I've decided that the best way to deal with alignment is to write it out of the game. It makes encounters more interesting, characters more complex, and it rachets player paranoia up considerably. All good things, from my perspective. Of course, then you have to figure out what to do about <span style="font-style:italic">Detect Alignment </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">Smite</span> effects. I basically decided that you could get around them by having the spells detect whether the given individual meets the caster's <span style="font-style:italic">perception</span> of a given alignment, although even this may be too liberal if you really like to play off of moral ambiguity. The problem is, this approach doesn't really work in Planescape.</p>

<p>Because each Outer Plane is tied to a specific alignment, abandoning alignment is a very real change to make. Fortunately, (I think) I've devised a pretty good solution. Instead of having my players pick an alignment, I have them pick an Outer Plane. This represents the Plane they have the most connection to, and the place where they will probably go upon death. I've only just started using this, so I'm not sure it will work as well as I think, but my hope is that it will not only make my characters more interesting, but the <span style="font-style:italic">Planes</span> more interesting, as they have more to do with the abstract ideas the planes represent, and less to do with the arbitrary convergance of two absurd ethical and moral scales.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Duckluck, the intent of this thread was never to figure out how these alignments relate to real life; I have made it abundantly clear that on posts in other threads that I do not believe these alignments pertain to real life.  The question is to determine how they are defined in-game.  Essentially, defining the framework by which morals and ethics are perceived within the game universe; of course like all frameworks it is not able to encompass the numerous variables and aspects that make up reality, but neither can the games rules or the in-game belief that everything is composed of four basic elements.  </p>

<p>Regarding the Book of Exalted Deeds, the listed aspects of good within are: helping others, charity, healing, personal sacrifice, worshiping good deities, casting good spells, mercy, forgiveness, bringing hope, and redeeming evil.  This is consistent with the player's handbook and is exceedingly far from saying that the nature of good is in defeating do gooders.  Similarly, the Book of Vile Darkness lists the aspects of evil as: lying, cheating, theft, betrayal, murder, vengeance, worshiping evil gods and demons, animating the dead, casting evil spells, damning or harming souls, consorting with fiends, creating the evil creatures, using others for personal gain, greed, bullying and cowing innocents, bringing despair, and tempting others.  An exceedingly long list which is again consistent with the Player's Handbook and that far from making it appear that you need to eat babies and the sort to be evil, it seems difficult to avoid being evil.  </p>

<p>The outer planes are composed of the convergence of the binary system of ethics and morals as entirely as the inner planes are composed of the convergence of the four elements and two types of energy.  By having players select planes it if anything limits them since nine of the planes represent quintessential manifestations of the nine alignments whereas the other eight present shades of the alignments; there are of course many other possible shades and mixtures of alignments that are possible.  And the usefulness of the detect alignment, protection from alignment, and variants of holy smite are dependent on the binary system.  In my eyes the best way to deal with this is to clearly define how DnD defines the alignments while at once remaining well aware that they are insufficient as a framework to understand reality.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>The problem isn't so much that the alignments make no sense - it's that Law and Chaos don't.</p>

<p>Then again, I sometimes feel that Neutral's the most misunderstood alignment of all. Let's get one thing straight - Neutral people do NOT commit one mildly evil act for every mildly good act.</p>

<p>Neutral represents three very different but interrelated concepts - at least in Planescape.</p>

<p>A Gygaxian (Active) Neutral comprises the first two:</p>

<p>A: The willingness to create a reality where the ability of all creatures to make choices that define them - to choose Good or Evil.<br />
B: The willingness to craete a reality where these choices change only themselves and not the entire fabric of the universe.</p>

<p>This is what the Rilmani do. They don't screw over the Archons because they don't like Good, they screw over the Archons because if Evil and Chaos didn't exist, people choosing to do good would mean nothing [to their worldview].</p>

<p>On the other hand, you have passive neutrals. They use the third Neutral definition.</p>

<p>C: The lack of an actual, concrete devotion to a concept or activity.<br />
_</p>

<p>This is where Law and Chaos break down, of course. It's easy to see how someone can be actually good - "Let's go start soup kitchens!" - or actually evil "I don't need him! Now let's break down his door and steal all his valuables, leaving him to die a life of impoverished misery!"</p>

<p>You can define Law as the devotion to structure and effectiveness - an ethical code that works for you. Unfortunately, this just means that Chaos is insanity. Rapidly violating your own precepts is impossible to do - you're only going to live once and take one course of actions. However, the definition of Chaos implies that the only difference from Law is that *you don't know what you are going to do* - which means you are insane.</p>

<p>It's not a pretty dichotomy.</p>

<p>How do I handle it? I go ahead and say that sure, Law is objectively good/useful. Why do you think that the Archons actually accomplish something, while the Eladrin just sort of... do Eladrin things?</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Maybe a more useful definition of Chaos would be somebody who doesn't want to do what other people tell them, but still has their own personal code of behavior. They just don't respect authority. Whereas a Lawful person feels that laws and rules are good just for the sake of having rules, and that society should have more rules and laws, not for the purpose of giving them power or doing good, but for its own sake. Or who believe that there is only one way to behave, and conformity is necessary and should be imposed.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>So in that definition, a Lawful person's actions are those he believes are determined by outside stimuli, and a Chaotic person's actions are those that he believes are determined by inside ones?</p>

<p>The problem here is that "*Creating* Rules for the Sake of Rules" has never really been a lawful thing. Following them, yes, but creating - not so much. Look at the Guvners - they're the most Lawful Faction out there, and they're looking for the universal rules that work - not rules for the sake of rules that don't.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Oberoni_fallacy, I disagree with your assessment of law and chaos.  Effectiveness does not come into play in regards to law and chaos but consistency and adherence to a code of rules does.  A lawful person is willing to submit to a set of rules; these can be the laws created by others in which case he will follow the rules regardless of the circumstances.  Or he could create a personal code of honor, stick with it and follow it regardless of the circumstances; for example vowing to never lie and then sticking to that even in situations where not lying could potentially hurt others or himself.  <br />
Whereas, a chaotic person will not be so confined.  He will ignore or actively rebel against rules created by others.  He will not likely create a personal code of conduct, and if he does he will change it frequently or ignore it when it is effective to do so.</p>

<p>Neutrality in regards to this lies down the middle; generally by believing that whether or not the follow the rules is secondary to some other goal, such as helping others (neutral good) or helping oneself (neutral evil).</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Regarding rules for the sake of rules; granted there are no people who truly desire that, but in reality (which I am citing despite the fact that the alignments are bad at explaining reality) there are many people who do believe that order is an end unto itself.  These are people, and I have spokent to many, who believe that most people (themselves excluded of course) are unable to make good decisions and would, left to there own devices, end up destroying themselves and others.  As such there needs to be laws to keep everyone in line and allow society to function effectively.  This is in my eyes a quintessential lawful neutral attitude; there are of course variations of this for lawful good and lawful evil.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Saying that personal codes of conduct are inherently lawful is one of the most deceptive and false aspects of the Law/Chaos dichotomy. After all, aren't morals simply a set of internally held beliefs that people adhere to? Violating your internal code of conduct is at least as likely to change your moral (Good/Evil) alignment as your ethical (Law/Chaos) alignment. Also, playing by your own rules is typically seen as a chaotic trait, whereas being self-disciplined is a lawful one, <span style="font-style:italic">even though they're the same damn thing!</span> </p>

<p>Really, the system doesn't work because the system is too complex. The two alignments encompass too many things that aren't actually opposed to, or even different from, one another. If you can't describe the difference between law and chaos in just a few sentences, then chances are you are using a definition that is too complex to work.</p>

<p>I have found though, that definitions that are based entirely on internal motivations are always frought with contradictions, while definitions that use inernal reasoning and external actions, are always too complex and stupid to be usable, but a system based entirely on external actions can work, but only if you can get your players to stick to it. For instance, the definition I tried before I finally just gave up and dropped alignments entirely was this:</p>

<p>Lawful characters want to follow the rules and are psychologically capable of following the rules. Therefore, they will always uphold and live by the rules of what they deem to be a legitimate authority, even if those rules are sometimes in violation of their own personal morals (note that a Lawful good character living under an evil king may well consider that king to be illegitimate).</p>

<p>Neutral characters are either capable of following the laws but unwilling to, or willing to follow the laws but something in their personallity renders them incapable of it. Both types typically have some respect for the <span style="font-style:italic">concept</span> of Law, but find themselves unable or unwilling to restrain themselves to it.</p>

<p>Chaotic characters are those who are unwilling <span style="font-style:italic">and</span> unable to follow the law. This doesn't mean that they will constantly break the law, but when they do follow it, it won't be out of any actual respect for it. When given the opportunity to break the law to achieve ones own ends and the chaotic individual is not ruled by cowardice, the chaotic character <span style="font-style:italic">will</span> do it. Hell, the crime could be high treason, but as long as the chaotic individual knows he won't get caught, he will be totally willing to do it. A chaotic individual will almost never follow the law when it violates his own personal morals, and when one does it will inevitably be to save his or her own skin.</p>

<p>Note that Lawful individuals are more likely to become pawns to others, while chaotic individuals are more likely to break laws that are best left unbroken. It is no coincidence that Mechanus has the most ordered and technologically advanced society in the multiverse, while Limbo has a bunch of savages who run around stabbing each other with pointy sticks.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Violating your personal code of conduct is inherently non-lawful but only alters your moral alignment if the manner in whichy you ignore leads in a moral/immoral direction.  For example, some has personal code of honor that says that they do not lie; lying for this person is automatically a chaotic act.  Lying to help others makes the act good and lying to help yourself at the expense of others is evil.  </p>

<p>Self-discipline and "playing by your own rules" are different things; primarily because the meaning of "playing by your own rules" is largely ambiguous.  If a person is genuinely playing by a set of rules he is not chaotic; though I would only call someone who ignores external laws lawful if they are exceedingly self-disciplined.  When playing by your own rules means merely following your impulses without any codified behaviors, this is chaotic.  Self-restraint of impulses is lawful, allowing your impulses to flow free is chaotic; a mixture of the two is neutral.  If your impulses lead you to help others you are good, if your impules lead to hurt others you are evil, if they lead in neither direction you are neutral.  </p>

<p>It is rare for there to be any meaningful system that can be described in its entirety in a few sentences.  Law and chaos can both be described in a few sentences but to fully understand them take many more.  External action in the form of submission to external laws is insufficient as a definition for lawful; if this was the case there would be no way to call a ruler and lawmaker lawful since he is the law.  Since laws are created by people, to some extent laws can be considered the externalization of internal codes of conduct.  And beliefs regarding laws also need to be taken into consideration.  A lawful person believes law and order are necessary for society to function (which also indicates an emphasis on society over the individual); whereas a chaotic individual believes that laws are unnecessary and crush freedom and individuality (which indicates an emphasis on the individual over society).    </p>

<p>It is clear from your detailing of law vs. chaos that you have a strong bias towards law, and see chaos as somewhat incompatible with good.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I may have a bias towards law, but then, so do you, according to your own system, the vast majority of real people are lawful. Honestly, who <span style="font-style:italic">doesn't</span> have a personal code of conduct that they try to adhere to rigidly? It's part of being sane. Whether you realize it or not you've effectively limited chaotic alignments to the dangerous fringes of society who are hopelessly incapable of adhering to any set of principles for very long. Basically making Chaotic Good a contradiction. How can you have a set of morals if you don't follow a set of internal guidlines? If you do immoral acts for no other reason than because you can't play by the rules, than how can you be good, or even sane?  Do you see the problem here?</p>

<p>I think you may have misunderstood me.  In my eyes, chaotic individuals are at least as capable of being Good as lawful people. In fact, because they aren't encumbered by external laws, they are far freer to follow their own personal code of ethics than lawful people. For an example, look at the case of a known killer who gets aquited on a fluke. A Lawful Good individual would be forced to except that the law isn't perfect but must be followed regardless, so he would just sit home and fume. A Neutral Good individual would also probably sit on his or her hands. A Chaotic Good person, on the other hand, may well track the killer down and apply some vigilante justice.</p>

<p>In modern society, chaotic people have a tendency to get arrested if they try things like that, and we have been taught to see anarchism as being simply unacceptible. In D&amp;D though, society is much less advanced and chaotic oulooks are far, far more common. You should be careful about saying that "primitive" people, especially "Barbarians" are chaotic, however, because most tribal societies do have a rather detailed set of rules that they expect their members to live by. Instead, see chaos as a force of primitivism, because chaotic societies lack the necessary institutions and social order needed for a proper division of labor, therefore, chaotic societies cannot have anything much more complex than simple farming without a few lawful (or at least oppressive) members of the society to keep them in line.</p>

<p>Why can't a rulerbe lawful or chaotic, anyway? A lawful king is one who follows the conventions and social norms of the country he rules, not to mention his own decrees. A chaotic king is one who won't even follow his own rules, and may even attempt such taboo acts as marying his sister or proclaiming his horse Consul (good ol' Caligula). Chaotic rulers are almost always either born into power or swept into it by extrordinary means, that or they just go nuts. Even in generally chaotic societies where the guy with the most sticks win, you generally have to play by the established rules if you don't want to get clubbed to death.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I know a wide variety of people who don't have a personal code of conduct that they don't try to adhere to rigidly; since I am defining a personal code as one that is conciously expressed.  If you avoid hurting someone because of inclination that is evidence of good; if you avoid hurting someone because of the law or your personal code that is evidence of law.  A ruler can be lawful but (and this only applies to rulers who words are the law) since the degree of their lawfulness is largely measured in terms of how much they follow their own decrees (as you said) it amounts to how closely the follow their personal code since the law is the externalization of their code.  If you include adherence to tradition as part of being lawful; I agree with you and misunderstood part of your previous argument.  Since traditions, customs, and norms are frequently not enforced by force, but rather internalized; I consider the acceptance of those as part of a personal code.  If you believe that personal code that comes from tradition makes the code not personal; than a lawful person would have to follow something other than personal code, leaving personal codes for those who ethically neutral.</p>

<p>So it appears that we have both been misunderstanding each other and don't really disagree over much of significance.  Though, I'm not sure what you are referring to by saying that I should be careful about saying "primitive"; I never said primitive nor did anyone else.</p>

<p>I have modified my original definitions to include adherence to an external code of conduct (now that I have redefined all adherence to customs and tradition as external) what aspect of my definition of law vs. chaos do you disagree with?</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>But why must a law system be an expression of the ruler's personal code of conduct? Maybe its just rules and laws put in place to prevent insurrection.</p>

<p>I think that having a personal code of conduct is possible for Chaotic people. It is the external code imposed by somebody else that Chaotics don't want to follow. But I don't think it is necessary to assume all Chaotic people are <span style="font-style:italic">unable</span> to obey laws. Some of them just don't want to, or are only willing to obey laws that agree with their personal code, without much regard for consequences. Wheras a Neutral person has some respect for the law but refuses to obey laws that violate their personal code too much, and resists laws that are or seem arbitrary and pointless.</p>

<p>Personally, I think lying, cheating, and stealing would be Chaotic, not Evil. The reasons for doing those things would be moral, but the actions themselves are Chaotic. Robin Hood was a thief, but he stole things for very altruistic reasons.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Vaevictis, I agree with you.  The example of the ruler whose rules are an extension of his own code of conduct was largely there to show why a definition of lawful that consisted of obeying laws was not sufficient.  </p>

<p>Also, I agree that lying, cheating, and stealing are not inherently evil but rather chaotic; book of vile darkness listed those as evil but I am trying to move away from examples to grasp the essences of alignment.  And in the rare cases that stealing does not hurt others and is done to help others it is good.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I generally see the Law/Chaos dichotomy as socio-political.  Law is about authority, conformity, and obediance.  Chaos is about freedom and individuality.  I tend to take behavior and sanity out of the picture.</p>

<p>  A Chaotic person is just as capable of having a personal code of ethics as a Lawful person.   The difference is that while a Lawful person will accept a code from an outside source (eg religious codes, political laws, or even the orders of an authority) because he believes that rules are neccessary for social stability and that questioning individual rules endangers the entire system, a Chaotic person will choose each part of her code carefully because she believes in each part wholehartedly regardless of where it came from.</p>

<p>  If a Chaotic person is shown a book of religious or philosophical wisdom, she may decide she agrees with the ideas in it and may not; frequently she may decide that some of it has good ideas while the rest is utterly retarded.  She will likely already have parts of her code that are similar to  some of the parts she likes.  She may decide that she should incorporate new aspects or refinements to her code based on things she never thought of before.  She may even decide that some parts of her code don't make sense in light of these ne ideas, and discard them.  This is generally not done lightly, but is likely to happen on occaision.</p>

<p>  Also, just because someone has a personal code, doesn't mean that they neccessarily stick to it.  Both Lawful and Chaotic people may believe that one should keep their word.  Both may suffer a moment of weakness and <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> keep their word.  The failure to keep to one's code of ethics is not inherently Lawful or Chaotic, nor is it inherently Good or Evil.  The situation, the action, the intent, and most importantly the consequence of the action combined determine its allingment rating.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I'm with you Narfi. That's actually about what I was saying. Inner discipline is fine, but it is hardly a good barometer for someones lawfullness. I based my earlier model mostly on how the person reacted to externalities, expressly to distance myself from that notion. </p>

<p>Honestly, I can't find anything in your post that I disagree with or object to. I think it matches beautifully with my model.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Narfi Res, I largely agree with you; but I have a couple of objections.  First, you say that someones behavior does not affect their ethical alignment; this is both directly contradicted later and is the only meaningful way to tell whether the player is really playing the alignment he says his character is.  Second, while both a lawful and a chaotic character can change their code, they are very different in how they go about doing it.  Since a chaotic individual's code is entirely internal and is pieced together by a variety of things, it is constantly changing and evolving.  But a lawful individual is only going to change his code, since it is external, in very specific circumstances; such as leaving his nation to live in another nation and then following their laws and customs, or a monk leaving his monastery and its traditions to join a different monastery and then embracing their traditions.  If someone violates their code it is frequently an ethical "violation"; since if a lawful individual breaks the law or a monk violates the code of his monastery they are moving away from law.  I agree that every circumstance is different and alot depends on context and intentions (so essentially it is up to the DM to rule on every circumstance) but some generalities can be made.  But the actual consequences of the action (as opposed to the intended consequences) should not be overly taken into account; none can fully predict the effects of their actions (though of course if a player is lying to you, you can call them on it).</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>I'm of the opinion that, just like you can't usually tell if someone is good or evil just by having a brief conversation with them, it shouldn't be overly obvious whether a character is lawful or chaotic. People who know a characher really well, will probably have a very good idea of where that character stands on the Law/Chaos divide, but like good and evil characters, lawful and chaotic characters should only obviously display their alignment in certain situations. Generally speaking, how they react in high-pressure situations will reveal more about a character's alignment (and personality in general) than that character may know themselves. </p>

<p>Therefore, in more low-key encounters, it is appropriate to look at a character's intentions as much as actions, but when a character in a high-pressure situation is forced to make a major moral and ethical decision with a clear "right" and "wrong" or "legal" and "illegal," their decision, whatever internal justification they use, should be an accurate reflection of their alignment. If it is not, it is within the DM's rights to anounce an alignment shift. This will annoy the players to no end, but it's better than having them all slowly shifting toward Chaotic Evil without admitting it.</p>

<p>These accidental breaches of alignment will happen most often when a character who is supposed to be "good" does something obviously selfish and cruel, and tries to offer a feable justification like "it was a joke," or "he deserved it." Perhaps even more common will be a "lawful" character who  breaks the law when given no obvious <span style="font-style:italic">legal</span> way to get what they want. This can be because the DM has set up a plot that actually does require the character to break the law (in which case, shame on the DM), but mostly it's just because the player didn't want to go through the trouble of figuring out how to work within the law. The reality is that "good" and "lawful" tend to be harder (or at least less advantageous) to roleplay than "evil" and "chaotic," because the former force players to work within restrictions, while the latter allow them to ignore such restrictions on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p>This started out as a response to Mak, but I seem to have gone off on a tangent...</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>I'm really far too lazy to read all of the posts above, although I might at later and more boring time. However, said laziness does not apply to stating my own opinion, which I will proceed to do shortly. Firstly, however, I want to say that in my opinion both the character alignments of D&amp;D and their respective planar alignments are far from definate, and could be interpreted differently under different circumstances. At this point, defining each would be next to impossible, as it would be far too easy to contradict any possible definition with but a single quote from one of the many canonical publications of both 2e and 3/3.5e. I don't remember which 2e book it was, but one contained a 'quoted' conversation between two people with one trying to narrow down the definition of evil while the other kept rejecting his claims by bringing up various people and factions that fit that definition yet would not be considered evil, per se. It is fitting to bring that up here.</p>

<p>Now for my own overly simplified and holey theory:</p>

<p>¤) Good is the natural and un-enforced harmony and subsequent peace between an individual and his/her/its surroundings, including other creatures. <br />
¤) Evil is the natural disharmony and subsequent strife or unhappiness between an individual and his/her/its surroundings, including other creatures.<br />
¤) Law is the valuing of society over the individual.<br />
¤) Chaos is the valuing of individuality over society.<br />
¤) Neutrality (which comes in two forms yet lumped under one heading) is either a lack of extremism in either of the two axes (or agreeing with both) or the deliberate balance of extremes to create an active equality (such as what the Rilmani are trying to achieve and the Demented obstinately contradict with their being both lawful and chaotic at the same time).</p>

<p>Again, a very simplified and broad view, but with a few smudges it seems to fit most of the planes, at least at my first glance. I can't say I honestly sat around contemplating this for hours, so it is very likely I might have missed some point that easily negates my above mentioned theory. Feel free to support or refute it as you will.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

First, you say that someones behavior does not affect their ethical alignment; this is both directly contradicted later and is the only meaningful way to tell whether the player is really playing the alignment he says his character is. </div></p>

<p>I should have been clearer.  Behavior qualities such as impulsiveness or self-discipline are not inherently Chaotic or Lawful.  Actions that are counter to or reinforce a society's or religion's rules, or that affect the freedom of another, or submission to/ rebellion against authority are definately one or the other.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>If someone violates their code it is frequently an ethical "violation"; since if a lawful individual breaks the law or a monk violates the code of his monastery they are moving away from law.  </div></p>

<p>Failing to abide by one's personal code is not Chaotic, but intentionally breaking an external code that the person is expected to adhere to may be.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>
I agree that every circumstance is different and alot depends on context and intentions (so essentially it is up to the DM to rule on every circumstance) but some generalities can be made.  But the actual consequences of the action (as opposed to the intended consequences) should not be overly taken into account; none can fully predict the effects of their actions (though of course if a player is lying to you, you can call them on it).</div></p>

<p>How does that one go?  "The road to Hell is paved with good intentions" I believe it is.  Consequences are what matter the most.  If a well meaning person takes an action that results in peoples deaths, that person is responsible despite his intentions.  Intentions might mitigate the circumstances, but shouldn't hold as much weight.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Iavas, your law vs. chaos distinctions are fine, but somewhat insufficient.  Where would a lawful evil wight fit into that?  Your good vs. evil distinction I believe to be flawed.  Harmony is reflective of law not good; but since our culture frequently equates law with good this isn't surprising.  If good is unenforced harmony with others and the environment, modrons living in mechanus would be exemplars of good.  Likewise, the inhabitants of Ysgard would almost certainly be evil because of their strife with their surroundings.

<p>Narfi Res, I largely agree with your first two points, but not the third.  I believe that in reality the effects of ones actions are more important than the intentions behind them (since I do not believe there is any reality apart from this one to validate an action that lead to the harm of others), but the morality of DnD is akin to Christianity or Islam in that ones moral status essentially equates to the state of their soul.  Ineptitude shouldn't prevent someone from being good (in the moral not qualitative sense).</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

</div></p>

<p>Ah, yes! It was Faces of Evil, wasn't it. According to my system, a LE wight is lawful because it is attempting to create a society (a society of undead wights, but a society with it as the ruler nonetheless) and is evil because it must kill all living things around it to do so. What I meant by 'harmony' is not a perfect uninterrupted perfection in everyday activities but rather a lack of negative emotions and resulting conflict. The modrons are not in perfect harmony, as they are constantly butting heads with anybody who disagrees with their laws. Their attempts to make the most coordinated society will not result in harmony (nor, therefore, ultimate Good) because they believe everybody must adhere to their laws and few outside of their species agrees with them. On the other hand, everybody in Elysium has an equal mix of caring for others (law) and caring for oneself (chaos) while still retaining a natural and easygoing peace (good). Of course, none of the planes perfectly exemplify their alignment, so contradictions will be found even on the extremes of the axes. In regards to Ysgard, you must remember that despite all the fighting and death, the combat does not stem from hatred but rather a desire to improve oneself (chaos) for various reasons, including being ready for Ragnarok amongst the Norse. The combat does swing them to the very edge of Good, as you can't really call it harmonius, but everybody there pretty much agrees that there's nothing wrong with the system, so it's more of a very large and vicious sparring match than actual war. So, that's my defense. I would somewhat disagree with your defintions of Good and Evil because for me the sacrifice of self for others is as much, if not more, Lawful than Good in my mind. It's really a matter of perception though, so I agree to disagree.  <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/tongue.png" title="Sticking out tongue" alt="Sticking out tongue" class="smiley-content"/></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Well... uh, I guess we could duel to the death, but I really hate to get blood on this new shirt. And just for the record, archons are lawful too. Notice that pretty much all the lawful groups (Modrons, Hardheads, Formians, Archons, Baatezu, etc) are disliked by the majority of everybody else, including other lawfuls, because they only agree to one set of rules, their own. All others must comply. That creates tension.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Yes, law does create tension because of the belief that they alone are right.  I would include that in the defintion of law.  But despite that, archons are good all the same.  I you could argue that archons are less at peace with their surroundings than guardinals; and this would fit with your argument.  But you could not argue that yugoloths are less at peace with surroundings than the tanar'ri.  </p>

<p>In defence of self-sacrifice as good; I pointed out that this sacrifice can take many forms.  Giving your life for the good of your nation, would be lawful good (self-sacrifice + society over individual).  But one can sacrifice time and energy to help another regardless of their ethical alignment; and this is something that a good individual alone would do.  A chaotic good individual would certainly devote time and energy to help an oppressed underclass.  And any good individual could sacrifice his life to save a friend.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Once again, the descriptor you're giving to CG somehow lines up with the descriptor that one website gave to Mount Celestia. The one that was more or less socialism.</p>

<p>If Chaos is going against athority, and Law is helping society over the individual, what do you call someone who opposes an authority <span style="font-style:italic">because</span> the authority is harming society? Assuming (as I do) that oppressed underclasses still count as part of society. Is it Lawful (because you care about the greater good) or is it Chaotic (because the authority at the time doesn't care about the greater good)?</p>

<p>The idea that society's needs trump individual needs can be Good instead of Lawful if it is your own individual needs that you sacrifice for society's needs. The decision can be made for moral rather than ethical reasons. A Good action should not be confused with Lawful action, unless we want to equate Law with Good (and I don't).</p>

<p>If a LG person disobeys a LE authority, are they still Lawful?</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>If a lawful good person disobeys a lawful evil authority; they are not acting in a lawful manner (though a few instances of this are not enough to change their alignment).  The example of the chaotic good individual helping the underclass raised apparently raised more issues than I thought of or planned for.  A LG individual would work within the system to change the system to allow the incorporation of the underclass and marginal groups into mainstream society.  A CG individual would see this as evidence of the corruptness of the society and act outside of and against the government to help the underclass; like stealing from the rich to give to the poor.  Or the CG individual might encourage them to drop out of society and join a commune (which would eventually collapse from the differing opinions of those in it). </p>

<p>Chaos is going against authority and placing the individual before society; law is listening to authority and putting society before the individual.  A lawful authority can oppose a poor leader; but will do so through legal means, such as impeachment.  In the case of monarchies there really is little they can do, but guide the leader in being a better leader.  These grey areas are not a particularly big deal since neutrality is always an option.</p>

<p>Law and good are seperate.  The moral and ethical components of an individuals alignment are not entirely seperate; they influence the way the two components are interpreted by the individual.  A good individual can always put others before themselves; but the manner and the nature of the others depends largely upon the ethical component.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I prefer to think of it this way - a person of a Lawful alignment that is placed, inescapably, into a society that agrees with his Lawful side but disagrees with his standing on the Good/Evil axis will be forced to make a choice as to the belief of which axis he finds most important.</p>

<p>For instance, say a Lawful Good person is thrown into a Lawful Evil city that said person cannot escape. He would either chose to sacrifice his Lawful side by ignoring the regulations of the LE society and commit acts of Good or sacrifice his Good side by lawfully following the regulations but thereby committing Evil acts.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Even if a lawful good individual is living in a lawful evil society he need not necessarily make this choice.  There are actually a limited number of situations where he'd have to.

         <p>Beyond that, if a Lawful individual believes that a government is illegitimate, he can sometimes justify not following the law. For instance, if a usurper overthrew the good king of Carpenteria, a lawful individual (even, occasionally, one that is lawful neutral) can decide if he is going to follow this new king, or join the resistance movement. If he does the latter, he will eventually start moving toward chaotic, but it may take a while, and if the revolution is speedy enough, his alignment may not change at all.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>True, but how long do you really think a Paladin is likely to survive in Ribcage without either starving or getting killed while trying to help others (trying to remain LG), neglecting to help others while trying to survive according to the tough bearucratic society's regulations (retaining Law while losing Good), or deiciding to cleanse the populace and make a better way (retaining Good while losing Law)?</p>

<p>You don't need a law explicitly stating "go out and hurt people three times before lunch" to drive a decent person to evil acts in a society where the only way to survive and not go to jail is to forego others and advance yourself.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Evil, by my definition, is the imposition of ones will on another person, even if it's against theirs, and a willingness to sacrifice others to further your own ends.</p>

<p>Law falls into the above definition. This is why I feel that it's entirely justified for paladins to be utter goose-stepping genocidal fascists and still be Lawful Good. (Law's absolute, Good's subjective)</p>

<p>I think it's fairly unlikely you'll find a government being anything other than lawful evil, even in the real world.</p>

<p>A government decides what is right for itself (sometimes it calls itself the "country") and then imposes laws in line with that decision. Anyone that doesn't toe the line is acting against the interests of the country and society in general. Most governments are more than happy to sacrifice large numbers of individuals for their own gains. What country hasn't gone to war under the flag of "the nation's interests", sacrificing maybe millions in that name? What government doesn't <span style="font-style:italic">regularly</span> pass laws that rub a large portion of society up the wrong way? That portion of society still has to lump it, though, at least until the next "free" election, if there's to be one.</p>

<p>Thing is, a government run any other way is not a government. Government <span style="font-style:italic">implies</span> Law, and the imposition of will.  Lawful Evil.</p>

<p>I realise there's probably huge stonking flaws in my logic, but there's always going to be flaws in such arguments. What we're doing here is philosophising - attempting to define abstract concepts in terms of quantifiable and measurable criterea.  </p>

<p>Not going to happen.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>What we are trying to do is unravel someone else's (the creators of the DnD alignment system) conception of morality (in the form of alignment) and increase understanding through concrete examples.  What you did was quite obviously not define DnD alignment.  But rather you are talking about the real world; that is fine.  Granted this thread isn't really the ideal place for it; but it should make for an enjoyable discussion.</p>

<p>I agree with everything you said about the government, and I think it holds true of any organization; particularly corporations and to a slightly lesser extent schools.  I believe that all such entities not only impose the will of those at the top on others (and not just those within the entity) but are also rooted on exploitation.  A government survives by taking the resources earned by those who compose it.  Those who head a corporation or any business thrive by giving their workers, those who actually do the labor that allows them to live in luxury, the slightest percentage of what they accomplish; and as outsourcing shows, they are quite happy to toss aside loyal employees without any regard for how they will fare, for the sake of finding those that will work for a smaller wage (of course not having interest in how well these individuals are able to survive).</p>

<p>There is really nothing that can be done about this.  While the systems of exploitations and control have changed over millenia; the strong (and there are many kinds of strength) have always thrived by preying upon the weak.  And this isn't just limited to humans; it is universal among all animals.  Any carnivore that kills another animal exercises its superiority and sacrifices the life of another being to sustain its own.  Even herbivores survive by virtue of the death of others.</p>

<p>This is a universal fact of life.  You can tear down the governments and the corporations of the world, and we could return to a state of primitivism; but still this will not change.  Still there will be those who by virtue of superior strength, intellect, or skill at manipulation will bend others to their will and survive off of them.  So why call this evil?  Why reject a Truth that life could not exist without?  And a man is not a vegetable, so lets not pretend that we could survive if this were not the way the world worked.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I call it evil because it's evil. Human society is evil at it's core. It's not a comfortable thing to admit, but it's true.</p>

<p>Re-reading the PHB definition of Lawful Evil, can you honestly say there's a single government that doesn't fall into that alignment? </p>

<p>Then again, you could also say Lawful Evil tendencies are more often than not the result of pragmatic problem-solving. This makes the pill a little easier to swallow.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>The lawful evil alignment given in the PHB defines "evil" in a game; it cannot be used to describe reality accurately; and more specifically it as an extension of our culture's conception of evil.  </p>

<p>Using your previously given definition of evil not only is society evil but all organization is.  Your definition goes beyond that because by saying the imposition of ones will on another is evil, it essentially declares anyone that anyone who has a vision of the world, has their own agenda (that does not involve complete solitude), or in anyway has power is evil.  And this cannot be backed away from by saying that those with power don't need to use it, power is defined by its use.  </p>

<p>What justification do you have calling this evil?  Evil in reference to what?  If good is the reverse of your evil, good would be merely an abberation possessed by those lack the power to impose their will on others and are thus always the victim.  You may as well change your defintion to what is good is what is weak, and what is evil is what is strong.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Essentially, you're correct. By my rather broad and slap-dash definition, even natural selection is evil - the the strong survive, and the weak die.</p>

<p>Why do I call it evil? Simply because this is a discussion about good, evil, law and chaos, and not about "the way society is". I had to call it something, and lawful evil was the best fit, albeit that the "evil" acts are mostly the result of instinct at a very deep level.</p>

<p>To your other point, the opposite of my evil would be the willingness to help others survive and prosper, even if it is not in one's own immediate best interest. By that, I do not mean our theoretical "good" person would need to die to save another in order to qualify. Altruism tempered by instinct, one could say, might be a fair way of describing "good" realistically.</p>

<p>My view on the human condition isn't quite as bleak as I make out, though.</p>

<p>Left to its own devices, "human nature" (just to upset any existentialists out there) is, broadly, "good". We are social animals, and as such we have a concept of the need to protect others of our kind and help them survive. Although there would be no gain for ourselves, most of us would strive to be the Samaritan if we thought ourselves able to help. Some of us might even place ourselves at not inconsiderable risk to do so.</p>

<p>However, anthropologists have theorised (and to an extent I agree) that we are preconditioned to operate in small groups of five to twenty. Within that group, our altruistic tendencies are increased significantly. As the group grows larger, it diminishes until we reach the artificial construct that is the "nation".  </p>

<p>Those at the head of a "nation" care very little for the individual that exists outside of their own social group, and are quite comfortable turning that individual into an unfortunate statistic, along with thousands of others, for the sake of what they perceive to be the nation's best interest. Or, indeed, their own interests masquerading as the nation's. (After all, being the artificial sum of so many individual parts, how can a nation be said to have a singular interest on any matter?)</p>

<p>It's not out of any malicious intent, (which I suppose might be said to be the traditional definition of evil,) but rather because our instinctive altruistic social animal tendencies aren't designed to work on such a scale, and they break down. We're all the same in that respect, whether we are at the head of a nation or not. One might shed tears for the loss of a friend or even aquaintance, but very few feel genuine loss over a death they might read about in the paper, or see on the news.</p>

<p>Pfft...  Where am I going with this?  I think I'm in danger of rambling, if I'm not already doing so.</p>

<p>I'll boil it down to something on topic, and echo something that's already been said;</p>

<p>The D&amp;D alignment system is a game mechanic, and really must be taken in isolation. The definitions are specific enough to give a character an alignment based on their broad, stylised worldview. Attempts to define things as inherently nebulous as conceptual good and evil in terms of the real world are just going to leave us bashing our heads against the wall for the rest of eternity.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Moog, your definition does not work with DnD since it equates law with evil whereas in DnD they are two distinct and seperate things.  Since your definition did not work with DnD and was more broadly focused on reality; I treated it as a "real world" definition of evil.  </p>

<p>Most of us would not help in a situation that matched that of the Biblical proverb of the Good Samaritan.  This was tested once on students at a seminary who were walking to give a speech on the aforesaid Biblical story; most of them passed the injured man by without helping.  I'm honest with myself; I would never help an injured stranger.</p>

<p>There is quite a bit of information to support that humans are able to maintain close relationships with a relatively small group (but more on the order of 50 or so than 5 to 20) of people; so your point on that is largely correct.  However, just as politicians and CEO's might be very "nice" to those within their social circle and disregard their employees and constituents as objects; most tribes and bands do the same for those outside the group.  For many "primitive" bands and tribes the name of their tribe translates in their language to "people" and their term for outsiders translates to "not people."  </p>

<p>Largely because of these factors, and the inherent relativism of all morality, I don't concern myself with distinctions of "good" and "evil" in real life (except for the simple sake of argument).  This thread was started to define good and evil as they are within DnD, and as your previously stated, your defintion did not work.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>In Ribcage? For *quite* some time. The ruler of that town does Not want to slide into Baator and so is actively incoraging good folks to drop in for a visit (so long as they don't challenge his leadership) because he wants their good influence. Though admittedly that's not what you were getting at it does indicate that there's often context to these sort of situations that would allow actions and motivations to not always synch up as you would expect.</div></p>

<p>Yeah, it's the fourth law of the planes, which happens to allow itself to exist - for every rule there's an exception and for every exception there's somebody to point it out as a rule.</p>
