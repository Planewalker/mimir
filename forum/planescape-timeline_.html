         <p>I'd also consider the Planescape: Torment game to be semi-canonical. The only part I'd leave out is Shr'akt'lor being destroyed. It's not clear from the game that the city's destruction was permanent, anyway; it wouldn't take long for a few well-trained anarchs to rebuild it. It might be a good idea to put something in about Shr'akt'lor being severely damaged by a githyanki attack, with the weakness in its defenses being blamed on a heretical Zerthite sect called the Iron Circle.</p>

<p>I have the 1e Manual of the Planes, Secrets of the Lamp, A Paladin in Hell, and the Torment novelization. I'll see what I can do. While I'm at it, some of the genie-related history in the Land of Fate boxed set might be included.</p>

<p>The Book of Artifacts and Vortex of Madness also deserve to be at least semi-canonical. And probably the Black Spine adventure for Dark Sun, since that featured a githyanki rebellion. Queen of the Demonweb Pits and Throne of Bloodstone are definitely semi-canonical; something happened, but Tiamat and Lolth being killed wasn't two of them.</p>

<p>The Lich-Queen's Beloved in Dungeon #100 and the Harrowing in Dungeon #84 are also probably semi-canonical. And Umbra, a Planescape adventure in an earlier Dungeon that I don't have.</p>

<p>Also note that some of your work has been done for you <span style="text-decoration:underline"><a href="http://greyhawkonline.com/pitsofevil/viewtopic.php?t=1783" class="bb-url">in this thread</a></span>.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>There's no absolute canonical time, since the adventures are meant to be plugged in at the convenience of the individual gaming group. Like faster-than-light spaceships and Superman, these events move at the speed of plot. </p>

<p>In other words, whatever timespan works best for your story. </p>

<p>My guess, however, is a few months between each mega-adventure.</p>

<p>The Modron Procession <span style="font-style:italic">should</span> have taken years or decades to accomplish, but Tenebrous was rushing things. It probably lasted a year or less.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I started my group with the classic introduction in the campaign set <span style="font-style:italic">For the Price of a Rose</span>, since they were all primes. Then did the mini-adventure with the lost petitioner, tried to start <span style="font-style:italic">The Eternal Boundary</span> but got derailed, and moved on to <span style="font-style:italic">Dead Gods</span>, which we are about to finish after two years of RL play.  I also ran about 6 of my own "interludes" when we were short on players. These were interesting little mini-adventures to such places as Niflheim, Karasuthra and Hades, and my players say they enjoyed them more than the main campaign. So either I'm bad at running published adventures or I'm amazing at running side quests! <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/wink.png" title="Eye-wink" alt="Eye-wink" class="smiley-content"/>  </p>

<p>Dead Gods is certainly one of the most original and entertaining adventures I have ever read. It's no dungeon hack, that's for sure. It deals with epic events (no, not Epic Level) that affect Powers and planes alike. It has a great return to the Vault of the Drow in Greyhawk, and several very cool encounters. The walking tower of Tiac-Rami-No comes to mind. It is well illustrated and the characters are evocative. The only problem it has, and it's a serious one, is that too little information is provided to the players. For up to 75% of the adventure the PCs are stumbling around in the dark, and this can be very frustrating, especially if they miss some subtle clue in the beginning. </p>

<p>Eventually I might run <span style="font-style:italic">The Great Modron March</span>. It won't be too hard to retrofit it after Dead Gods; there isn't that much overlap.  </p>

<p>I don't know much about the other adventures. Most of them seem to have received lukewarm reviews, so I was never interested. I prefer to run heavily modified adventures of my own creation.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I know this thread is a little dead but it seems like the right place to post this, I found it on enworld awhile back but I cannot remember the name of the poster.. It seems he got it out of his email box anyways. Here it is as I saved it:</p>

<p>I was digging through some prehistoric files in my email box and found this little gem. I think it needs some expansion, but its a good start to a consistent chronology of events on the planes: </p>

<p>The Begining -- The planes are formed. (H:tBW) <br />
The baernaloths stagger forth from the mists of creation. <br />
(H:tBW) <br />
The baernaloths spawn the yugoloths. (H:tBW) <br />
The River Styx forms. (H:tBW) <br />
A baernaloth named Apomps crestes the gehreleths from dead yugoloths and is exhiled with the gehreleths into Carcerci. (H:tBW) <br />
The first ultroloth, the General of Gehenna, creates the <br />
Heart of Darkness to expunge the taint of law and chaos from the yugoloths which become the larvae of the lower planes. (H:tBW) <br />
A creature called the Maeldur Et Kavurik is told the true names of all the larvae. (H:tBW) <br />
The larvae migrated to the Abyss and Baator to evolve into the tanar'ri and baatezu. (H:tBW) <br />
The baernaloth dissappear, and the ultroloths become the leaders of the yugoloths. (H:tBW) <br />
The baatezu begin to explore the planes, eventually <br />
discovering the tanar'ri in the Abyss; as the tanar'ri stumble into Baator and find the baatezu. (H:tBW) <br />
The Blood War begins. (H:tBW) <br />
The archanaloths hire themselves out to either side of the Blood War, and betraying both. (H:tBW) <br />
The Lords of the Nine and the Princes of the Abyss (the Abyssal Lords) rise in power. (H:tBW) <br />

<p>Way this is set up... are these year equivalencies between settings? And is "YEAR 2000" in reference to real-time?</p>

<p>Is that meant in general "game release" terms? Because it might make a useful comparison point for the Urban Planescape project.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>There's no absolute canonical time, since the adventures are meant to be plugged in at the convenience of the individual gaming group. Like faster-than-light spaceships and Superman, these events move at the speed of plot. </p>

<p>In other words, whatever timespan works best for your story. </p>

<p>My guess, however, is a few months between each mega-adventure.</p>

<p>The Modron Procession <span style="font-style:italic">should</span> have taken years or decades to accomplish, but Tenebrous was rushing things. It probably lasted a year or less.</div></p>

<p>The issue is that the modrons are walking the Great Road - that is, using natural portals between the outer planes to visit each and every plane in order.  The Planescape boxed set said "Now, if a berk had the years and the compliance of the fiends in his path, he just might be able to walk the whole thing in sixteen lifetimes." Maybe the modrons know quicker routes, but it should still take quite some time. And Tenebrous had <span style="font-style:italic">reason</span> to rush it - he was <span style="font-style:italic">dying</span>.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>The Harmonium was founded 500 years ago, according to the Factol's Manifesto (page 90). </p>

<p>But you're right. The Harmonium <span style="font-style:italic">was</span> sent in to battle the Sinkers shortly after the Upheaval (page 40).</p>

<p>My guess is that it wasn't actually the Harmonium, but whatever  lawful faction, now extinct or merged with the Hardheads, that was acting as Sigil's police at the time. The timeline above suggests this was the Communals, but I'm not so sure. It's possible that the Incanterium was banished <span style="font-style:italic">before</span> the Great Upheaval, which would have left a free spot for another faction. And how do the Expansionists fit in? </p>

<p>Or, I guess, it could have been the Mercykillers or Guvners.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

Only one thing. I think that Orcus death happened one year before<strong> </strong><span><strong>120 th.</strong></span> At least this is what seemed to me reading Toril Chronology. <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
In another old topic we discussed the relation between Toril_Oerth-PS chronologies. <a href="forum/help-with-planescapetoril-chronology_.html" title="/forum/help-with-planescapetoril-chronology">/forum/help-with-planescapetoril-chronology</a>  
</p>
<p>
<span>579 CY – 119 th – 1359 DR</span>
Gareth Dragonsbane steals Orcus’ wand and kills the Lich Zangy. He
slays one of Tiamat avatars in the outer planes and thus manage to
shatter the wand. He brings the only one of the 3 parts that he is able
to find after the explosion (the heart of the wand, known as the
Tree-Gem) with him to Damara on Abeir-Toril. Bahamut starts to be
worshiped again on Toril. The demigoddes Kiaranselee slays the lesser
god Orcus, weakened by the loss of his wand, in his realm of Thanathos.
She erase his name from every written source existing in the multiverse
with powerful magic and hide the other 2 part of the wand (the iron
wand and the skull on his top, still united together) in Pandemonium
and calls her biggest temple in the Underdark of Toril “the Acropolis
of Thanatos”. On Oerth, Zuggtmoy, demon queen of fungi, is freed from
the Temple of Elemental Evil and can come back to the Abyss.

         <p>What about the stuff from Fiendish Codex II + Asmodeus?  I also see nothing about the Obyrith or the Baatorians.</p>

<p>As for "The Beginning", simple logic states that in the beginning there was only the Ethereal (possibility), which then spawned the Astral (belief) and the Elemental Planes (matter and energy).<br />
The first lifeforms and powers of course would have been the Draeden.  They would have been around since the armageddon of the previous creation cycle (presuming that the Multiverse functions under a Hindu-type creation cycle/Eternakl Recurrence-type system, which seems the most logical direction that the D&amp;D masterminds, had they thought about it, would have taken.  ALso, it's way more interesting than the Abrahamic and Norse model, in which you have primordial pristine perfect creation cycle,  the current flawed creation cycle, and then finally you'll have a perfect creation cycle, the end.  The Buddhist model falls somewhere in between the two since it states there will be nearly innumerable creation cycles before the Maitreya *essentially the Buddhist Messiah* comes and brings enlightenment to all life, forever breaking the endless cycle of death and rebirth, and all beings achieve Nirvana.)</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>Hyena of Ice</em> wrote:</div>What about the stuff from Fiendish Codex II + Asmodeus?  I also see nothing about the Obyrith or the Baatorians.</div></p>

<p>Check the dates on the thread above; it's from 2005. <span style="font-style:italic">Fiendish Codex I</span>, which introduced the obyriths, wasn't published until 2006. So nobody involved in the majority of the thread (before Arislyt's post) could have known about them.<br />
 <br />
However, the entry marked "Blood War begins" should be read as "War between the obyriths and vaati begins." The Battle of Pesh must have taken place in between when the fiends started corrupting the Prime and the formation of the Dark Eight. The formation of the Dark Eight coincides with the Reckoning, the civil war in Baator in which Moloch and Geryon were banished and Levistus and the Hag Countess were granted their dominions. That probably happened some time between 1000-2000 years ago (since Bel's coup over Zariel, which happened after the Reckoning, was over 1000 years ago), so there's a looooong interval between those events.</p>

<p>The <span style="font-style:italic">Fiendish Codex II</span> myth seems to take place during the Law-Chaos war and before the beginning of the Blood War proper after the Battle of Pesh. I associate Asmodeus's "angels" with the aphanacts mentioned in Dragon #341, who dominated Mechanus, crusading into other planes, until their fall probably some time before Pesh. The ancient Baatorians would have been created from larvae by the baernaloths at the same time as the obyriths (and it was definitely the obyriths and Baatorians, not the tanar'ri and baatezu). The Baatorians <span style="font-style:italic">weren't</span> involved with the Law-Chaos war. They were brutally conquered by Asmodeus and his minions according to <span style="font-style:italic">Elder Evils</span>.</p>

<p>The illithid empire was probably well after that (since the gith are descended from humans), so I'd switch some things around. The present-day Lich-Queen Vlaakith is the 157th of her line and has ruled for a thousand years, the longest of any githyanki ruler. Her predecessor (who was also a lich, and therefore probably unusually long-lived) ruled for over 500 years, according to Dragon #355. That's a total of 32,500 years, assuming an average of 200 years for each previous ruler, or less than eighty thousand years assuming 500 years for each previous ruler (very unlikely, I'd say). The average githyanki queen's reign might have been considerably shorter, of course, but Gith's rebellion was probably not earlier than 14,000 years ago (the time when psionics first appeared on Athas, said in the adventure <span style="font-style:italic">Black Spine</span> to be the result of a githzerai psionic bomb).</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>I thought the Illithid brought the gith and other slaves with them from the future...</p>

<p>Then of course we have to factor in the Aboleth empires (whose slaves are said to have prayed the first deities into existence.  Obviously this takes place looong before the Triassic-analogue era, and in all likelihood takes place during the Carboniferous analogue.)</p>

<p>Also, Kuo-Toa mythology (as well as several other bits of evidence, such as the existence of Ghaunadaur, Tharizdun, and The Patient One.) suggest that there was a Far Realm invasion early on in creation (the Kuo Toa claim that an influence from the Far Realm began the creation cycle).  In all likelihood, both stories are true AND false-- the primordial aberrant powers played a role in the creation process (being among the first powers of the multiverse), but did not CAUSE the creaton process.  Because of Ghaunadaur's physiology, I would place him in the same epoch as the Aboleth empires (I picture the Aboleth arising as a race during the Cambrian explosion analogue.  There's no telling where/when Tharizdun and The Patient One come from, however...)  The Great Mother I am uncertain since I am not aware how long the Beholders have been around (though my guess is that she appeared during the Firestorm Peak/Elder Elves incident)<br />
Also, this time, I picture this Farrealm rift as being closed by the powers of the Far Realm to keep stuff from the Multiverse from leaking in-- or seeping out.  (BTW, the Violet Dawn books-- namely Denizens of Avandu-- have a couple really interesting new monster races that would really add flavor to the Far Realm, including a neutral good race of energy beings who find Multiverse matter inimical.  The entire bestiary has HP Lovecraft written all over it.  It's good stuff.)</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>Hyena of Ice</em> wrote:</div>I thought the Illithid brought the gith and other slaves with them from the future...</div></p>

<p>Probably not, but it doesn't matter if they did or not for these purposes, because Gith's rebellion was in the past. Regardless of when the slave race Gith belonged to came from, at some point in the past the illithids formed an empire and Gith and her followers shattered it. Upon escaping from the illithids, Gith left as a hostage to Tiamat and Vlaakith became the first queen of the githyanki. We can calculate, extremely roughly, how long it's been since then because we know there's been exactly 157 githyanki queens. None of these queens came with the illithids from the future, since they didn't start their reign until after their race gained its freedom from the mind flayer yoke.</p>

<p>I say "probably not" because even <span style="font-style:italic">Lords of Madness</span> notes they enslaved the ancestors of the gith after they arrived in the past. The illithids arrived alone on a Prime world (called Pharagos in Dungeon #100) and conquered it, turning its human inhabitants into their slaves. </p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Dawn of the Overmind</span> notes that it took a thousand years for the illithids to create their artificial world, Penumbra, so they ruled an empire in the past for at least that long even before Gith's rebellion. During that time they altered some of their slaves using their tumerogenesis tanks to make them more psionically potent, so that they could be used as warriors against the voor, an insectoid race that posed a threat to illithid supremacy. After the voor were defeated, a few of these psionically empowered humanoids escaped into the general breeding population, and eventually their descendants became potent enough to rebel.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Then of course we have to factor in the Aboleth empires (whose slaves are said to have prayed the first deities into existence.  Obviously this takes place looong before the Triassic-analogue era, and in all likelihood takes place during the Carboniferous analogue.)</div></p>

<p>If the aboleths are actually the very first form of life to exist on worlds (discounting the draedens, who originated in the void), then I'd place them much earlier, like the Archean eon or whatever. But I tend to think the D&amp;D universe is substantially younger than our own (if only because mythogenesis doesn't take as long), it might not have literally been billions of years ago.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>The Great Mother I am uncertain since I am not aware how long the Beholders have been around (though my guess is that she appeared during the Firestorm Peak/Elder Elves incident)</div></p>

<p>While the beholder race might be considerably younger (I'm not aware of a mention of them prior to 3600 or so years ago), I think the Great Mother must have existed in the multiverse for much longer, since she was probably the ancestor of the oculus demons, who lived in the Abyss "well before the time of the tanar'ri" according to <span style="font-style:italic">Expedition to the Demonweb Pits</span> (and that, in turn, places her long before even elder elf civilization). That source actually said "the most fantastic story suggests the oculus demons were spawned by a gibbering mouther demigoddess and a giant with a hundred eyes - perhaps with a drop of beholder blood somehow added to the mix," but we know (from <span style="font-style:italic">Monster Mythology</span>) that the Great Mother mated with demons and demodands early on, so that seems the simplest theory. The Great Mother is probably the "gibbering mouther demigoddess" in question, and she probably mated with an obyrith of some kind (I'm tempted to say it was the many-eyed obyrith Cabiri) to produce the first oculus demons.</p>

<p>Gibbering mouthers have probably only been around in the multiverse since the Great Gate of Firestorm Peak, and they're probably related to gibbering orbs, beholders, and the Great Mother somehow, but I wouldn't be surprised if gibbering mouthers were creatures the Great Mother spawned when she existed in the Far Realm eons ago, and beholders were creatures she spawned in the multiverse much later. I'd assume the Great Mother entered the multiverse at around the same time as Ghaunadaur and similar entities, long before the elder elves.</p>

<p>The 4th edition sourcebook <span style="font-style:italic">Underdark</span> (yeah, I know, but bear with me) tells of a mythical event called the Great Hatching, when the Great Mother emerged in the Underdark from the Far Realm, tearing herself "from an egg that was her first worldly form" at some point before the height of the ancient illithid empire. The pieces of her shell became new eggs, each of which hatched into new beholders. The book suggests the particulars are just a myth the beholders tell and suggests a few alternative origins of the eggs (they might be created by a different god, be entirely natural, or have been accidentally created by the illithids near the end of their imperial period), but the hatching is real. This is a phenomenon that continues to the present day, the Hatchlands still existing somewhere in the Underdark, still occasionally spawning new beholders from fragments of what is believed to be the primal egg.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Monster Mythology's</span> creation story is slightly different, saying the Great Mother birthed the beholders from a cluster of "cosmic eggs" laid across the planes and worlds, from which the Beholder Ancients, the first hive mothers, emerged. Still, this isn't really incompatible with the 4th edition idea of the Hatchlands, and it's possible that these clusters of "cosmic eggs" have resulted in Hatchlands scattered in the underdarks of various worlds and planes.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><span style="font-style:italic">If the aboleths are actually the very first form of life to exist on worlds (discounting the draedens, who originated in the void), then I'd place them much earlier, like the Archean eon or whatever.</span></p>

<p>Well, I would assume that they'd have arisen during the Cambrian explosion-analogue.  I would not place them in the Archaean period because only bacteria and proto-bacteria existed then.  The Aboleth I am assuming are the first forms of SENTIENT life other than the Draeden.  The Cambrian explosion is the most likely canidate because a sentient species is most likely to occur (probability wise) during a period of great biological diversity.  This means the Aboleth could not have arisen any earlier than the Precambrian.<br />
I placed their Empires much later because the Carboniferous has the most diverse lifeforms and is still an epoch that would be very friendly to the Aboleths (as opposed to the Permian or Triassic, which are very hot and very dry), though other geological peiod canidates include the Devonian, and possibly the Silurian.  <br />
Anything before that, and their only slave canidates would have been antediluvian aberrations (e.g. flumph) and sentient trilobite-men.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I think, in retrospect, that you might be basically right. If aboleths created all plants and animals, the question is what they created them <span style="font-style:italic">from</span>. Aboleths aren't demiurges who create matter from nothing, and they aren't known for the ability to turn living constructs into self-replicating independent biological races. Making them super-alchemists with the ability to transform clay into seaweed is probably a bit much. They probably shaped and uplifted species they already found. I'm uncertain how much they did so: are they responsible for turning fish into amphibians? Did they turn invertebrates into fish? </p>

<p>There is a pleasing simplicity to the idea that the aboleths were created by a Far Realm entity touching the newborn worlds, and aboleths created all other plant and animal life. It answers a lot of questions. It comes down to whether or not you want questions to be answered that simply, with a Lovecraftian horror basically responsible for the player characters and everything they are. Most people probably don't, and treating aboleths instead as an invasive species that played a large role in the early development of many forms of life is probably enough.</p>

<p>Bacteria might not exist in the D&amp;D universe. Disease might be caused by negative energy instead, or by divine curses. Yogurt and cheese might be created by patterns of positive energy affecting the milk, patterns that replicate themselves in ways analogous to bacteria without actually being anything but pure energy. Or they might actually be tiny, mindless energons that infest everything in the world. </p>

<p>My idea in my previous post was basically that the aboleths existed before even single-celled life, and were responsible for everything, but I think I may back away from that a bit.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Perhaps the first part of that statement is true.  Aboleth would be more akin to living primordial soup than a giant single-celled organism.  Nonetheless, I stand by my statement that they'd likely be a result of the Cambrian explosion analogue.  The flumph is likely to have arisen in this era as well (we can deduce from the canonical articles on their ecology that they are a natural, antediluvian lifeform).  BTW, just an interesting note, but technically, a lot of the Cambrian Explosion lifeforms (such as Dickinsonia) would be classified as Aberrations.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">
