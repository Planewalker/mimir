        <div class="dice_rolls">
</div> <p>While not exclusively Planescape, I wanted to get an idea of what you guys thought of all the various TSR/WotC produced gameworlds.</p>

<p>Personally I believe there was a roughly decade-long period in the 80's and 90's that gave us an unprecedented burst of creative genius that will likely never be exceeded (or even matched for that matter).  These are the settings I will always most closely associate with D&amp;D, or any fantasy gaming.</p>

<p>Planescape (1994) - the very pinnacle of that creative surge I mentioned - Planescape is unsurpassed in sheer "wow" factor.  Never before or since has a game setting been so intellectually stimulating - from the inspiring locales, memorable NPCs/events, the in-depth philosophies, jaw-dropping artwork (DiTerlizzi's work got me back into illustrating), the unusual Gothic/Victorian/pseudo-steampunk vibe of Sigil, the unique language associated with planars, even the type-font was a really cool touch.  Planescape was a massively ambitious gamble.  But they absolutely nailed it on all counts - all the way from the Great Ring on down to the tiniest level of minutia.</p>

<p>Planescape was so good I devoured every product I could get my hands on.  Even though my gaming group was officially defunct at the time, I bought adventures just to read them as I would any novel.  They were That Good.  I believe Planescape to be the most inventive, addictive, and engaging setting to have ever been created - and I carry that statement over all forms of media - tabletop games, videogames, literature, cinema, etc.  Rating:  A+++</p>

<p>Ravenloft (1990 official campaign setting) - Not too many game settings were as effective at creating a particular mood and feel as Ravenloft.  Adventures in the Demiplane of Dread always put my players on edge, as so many situations could not simply be resolved by game mechanics.  Of what significance is your +5 armour or level 9 spells when you are not fighting a tangible foe, but instead trying to preserve the sanctity of your immortal soul?!?!</p>

<p>Though I never ran a full RL campaign, I sprinkled it frequently into my own game - often doing a one-shot night of terror somewhere in October.  And though over time it became a running gag to my players around Halloween (hey are the Mists coming to get us tonight!) it was always enjoyable.  Added features like Horror/Madness checks, the Tarokka deck, and absolutely some of the most compelling NPC backstories in any setting, Ravenloft gets a Rating: A+</p>

<p>Dark Sun (1991) - a brilliant twist on the familiar fantasy theme for players a little tired of the typical platemail clad knight on horseback battling dragons and wizards, while elves frolic in the forests.  Dark Sun turned all the old cliches and stereotypes on their head with the plot device of a post-apocalyptic "Mad Max" kind of gameworld - utilizing a magical, rather than sci-fi, type of world-ending calamity.</p>

<p>Dark Sun was harsh, brutal, and primal, and some High Fantasy purists may have been turned off by the overabundance of psionics and mutated beasts roaming the desserts.  But for gamers willing to open their minds and try something different, Dark Sun provided some truly memorable moments.  Rating: A-</p>

<p>Forgotten Realms (1987) - back to a more traditional setting.  FR is a massively large product line with virtually every type of environment, political system, etc. fleshed out in exhaustive detail.  It's a perfect setting for a DM who is less interested in world building, and would rather make (or buy) adventures in a fully built pre-existing setting.  It's also an excellent setting to draw newish players into, as anyone interested enough to try D&amp;D has most likely at least heard of Drizzt.</p>

<p>While FR doesn't jump out to me as doing anything revolutionary, simply based on its iconic and highly recognizeable characters, as well as it's meticulously crafted gameworld - it gets an intial Rating: B  When you factor in the other products (Al Qadim, Kara-Tur) that have been rolled into this same world, it rises to a B+.  There truly is something for everyone to work with here.</p>

<p>Dragonlance (1987) - unique among TSR gameworlds, Dragonlance was created as a setting meant to revolve around a storyline.  This gave a feeling of true progression and that you were making a lasting difference in the environment around you.  I can't say I adventured much in Krynn, but I found the novels to be exceptionally good - some of the best character development I'd ever read at that time.  Rating:  B+</p>

<p>There are several other settings in this time period, but I can't say I've been exposed to any of them enough to really comment intelligently.</p>

<p>Greyhawk - while I respect Gary Gygax's contribution to D&amp;D, I find a lot of his material to be downright goofy.</p>

<p>Spelljammer - ???  I've read a little bit of the lore, and can see where it can link with Planescape, but I've never played it.</p>

<p>Birthright - sounds ok, never played it.</p>

<p>Mystara - same.</p>

<p>Kingdoms of Kalamar - ???</p>

<p>Eberron - I can't get into it.  Though I try to be progressive and roll with the times, maybe I've finally hit that age of "My Generation syndrome" where I believe nothing can match what was produced before.</p>

<p>Anyway, I just wanted to gauge if you guys felt the same as I - that this ~10 year period in the 80's/90's was truly a Golden Age of RPG products that will likely never be matched.  I have certain reasons for initiating this conversation, but let's see what gets started from here first.</p>       </div>

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>I'm fond of the 1990s game worlds, but for my money, the d20/OGL era of the 2000s were the golden age of creativity in fantasy RPGs, with hundreds of different companies producing world after world after world. This was also the Paizo era of Dragon and Dungeon Magazines, which was excellent. </p>

<p>A lot of d20 stuff was crap, but some of it was wonderful. When the d20 bubble burst, we lost a lot. </p>

<p>Still, there's some good stuff being made even today, and the 1980s gave us some awesome stuff too - Glorantha, Talislanta, Mystara, Warhammer Fantasy. </p>

<p>Greyhawk, to me, <span style="font-style:italic">is</span> D&amp;D (Greyhawk + Planescape, actually); it's the source of so many iconic D&amp;D monsters, artifacts, characters, and plotlines. It's so much part of the DNA of Dungeons &amp; Dragons that even if you don't realize it, even in 4th edition, if you're playing D&amp;D, you're playing Greyhawk. Does your game have drow in it? Does it have Lolth, the Elder Elemental God, Vecna, the Machine of Lum the Mad, Tenser's Floating Disc? Although Gygax created the crucial foundation, it was Carl Sargent's work in the 1990s that to me sold Greyhawk as a full-featured, richly thematic, gritty setting well integrated into D&amp;D's cosmology. The 2000s built on this with the Living Greyhawk Gazetteer, Living Greyhawk Journals, Living Greyhawk campaign, and Dragon &amp; Dungeon magazine articles that together provided the most consistent, detailed, and luxuriously presented period of what will always remain the definitive D&amp;D campaign setting.</p>

<p>Mystara, before it was given that or any name, was the setting of the "classic" or "basic" D&amp;D game throughout the '80s, and it hosted over a hundred different modules (divided initially into Basic, Expert, Companion, Master, and Immortal levels) that for many provided the backbone of the D&amp;D experience, from the seminal dungeon <span style="font-style:italic">Keep on the Borderlands</span> to  plane-spanning sagas like <span style="font-style:italic">Where Chaos Reigns</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Talons of Night</span>. Then came the Gazetteer series, in which each nation in the Known World was detailed in what are still some of the best cultural sourcebooks ever, exotic and nuanced and high-magic and fun. This version of the D&amp;D game existed in parallel to the AD&amp;D game, and so only a little of it showed up in 2nd, 3rd, or 4th edition - most notably certain creatures like the choker, athach, nightshade, umbral blot, and neh-thalggu, and the iconic Isle of Dread that Paizo adapted into Greyhawk in their Savage Tide Adventure Path. As a result, it isn't really as definitive a part of D&amp;D's DNA as Greyhawk is, but it's still a classic world with roots that go back decades, which evolved as D&amp;D did. Its simple roots make it somewhat problematic, but it also makes it organic and complex and more alive than a world like Eberron (or Birthright) that was mostly constructed according to a single vision during a very short period of time. Though Eberron and Birthright have some very good elements in them.</p>

<p>If Mystara is problematic, Spelljammer is more problematic than Mystara ever was, and yet its DNA is entangled throughout Planescape and the 2nd (and to some extent, 3rd) edition era, and there's still something fascinating about its vast scope and ancient mysteries. Spelljammer was never a proper campaign setting, more a series of modules, sourcebooks, and novels of varying quality that were never quite knitted into a coherent whole. I think it's an intriguing skeleton upon which a campaign could be built, and my tolerance and even affection for its idiosyncrasies (like those of the Great Wheel) is very high. </p>

<p>If Greyhawk forms the backbone of D&amp;D going back to the early 1970s, the Forgotten Realms contains within it much of D&amp;D's evolution throughout the later 80s, the 1990s, the 2000s, and today. In the 1990s it was very much at the center of 2nd edition AD&amp;D, and it gobbled up most of that era's advancements, innovations, fads, and trends, both to its benefit and its detriment. In parts of it I have the same feeling that this is something very primal and iconic, something layered and enriched by decades of shared tradition, a classic part of D&amp;D that resonates still, that I feel with Greyhawk, Mystara, and the Great Wheel cosmology; classic adventure locales like Phlan and the Moonsea region. I think Zeb Cook did a terrific job with the Horde boxed set, and Al-Qadim remains one of my favorite settings. I think it was a blow to the Realms when it divorced itself from the Great Wheel and the greater D&amp;D continuity in 3rd edition, but 3rd edition remains one of the strongest eras in the setting's history, with a number of very good hardcovers that consolidated, expanded upon, and improved upon the setting. I say the best Forgotten Realms work today, some of the best since Eric L. Boyd's deities series, is being done by Brian R. James.</p>

<p>Some d20/OGL work that I'd recommend:</p>

<p>Malhavoc Press. Arcana Evolved, Ptolus, Book of Eldritch Might, Beyond Countless Doorways, Requiem For a God, When the Sky Falls, Chaositech.</p>

<p>Green Ronin. Book of Fiends, The Book of the Righteous, Unholy Warrior's Handbook, Aasimar &amp; Tiefling.</p>

<p>Necromancer Games. City of Brass. </p>

<p>Paizo Publishing. The Great Beyond.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Ahh, RipVanWormer - how I'd hoped you would chime in on this thread with your encyclopedic knowledge of all things D&amp;D.</p>

<p>First, let me clarify my stance on Greyhawk.  I mentioned that I respected it's place in the history of D&amp;D, but found some of it to be a bit too goofy.  This simple one line blurb was insufficient and dismissive of me.</p>

<p>Of course I recognize it as a fundamental building block of the game, and you barely scratched the surface when listing some of the iconic monsters, spells, and dungeons it has contributed over the years (a fact I'm sure you're more aware of than any of us).</p>

<p>There is, however, a good deal of it that simply turns me off.  There's just too many adventures with robots and laser guns, or portals to our own earth, or Alice in Wonderland settings, silly things that I find distasteful.  Also, most of those iconic mages are simply anagrams or reverse-spellings of Gygax's real life friends that played the game with him (Drawmij = Jim Ward for example).  If Gygax were alive today I'm sure he'd tell me I'm taking my fantasy too seriously, but I (and my players) prefer at least a tiny shred of verisimilitude - at least as much as can be achieved in a game with magic swords and floating castles.</p>

<p>I guess I'm simply not familiar enough with Sargent's reworked vision of Greyhawk to know the difference.  I utilize Greyhawk as more of a resource - transplanting those aforementioned dungeons, monsters, etc into other worlds.</p>

<p>I guess another reason could be this:  how many high fantasy settings with the traditional "medieval europe" archetype do you need?  Perhaps I'm showing my ignorance here, but what do Greyhawk, Forgotten Realms, and Mystara have to truly separate themselves from each other?  I know you can list hundreds of differences with ease, but how significant are they and could they not simply be dragged and dropped into each other's worlds without too much custom tailoring?  The other game worlds I mentioned in the OP fill completely different niches - planar travel, harsh post-apocalyptic world, creepy Gothic horror tales, etc.</p>

<p>While I can appreciate the nostalgia factor of Greyhawk, if I have to run a standard western Europe type world, I'd go with the Realms simply based on the breadth of material available.  Possibly this has to do with when I was introduced to D&amp;D chronologically, I don't know.  </p>

<p>I'll have to check out some of that OGL era stuff you mentioned though.  3.0/3.5 is right around the time I was getting out of D&amp;D, and while I was still actively running a campaign, I had it all mapped out and was loathe to add even more product to my already dragon-sized hoard of sourcebooks, accessories, and modules.</p>

<p>P.S.  I used to think I was uber-knowledgable about D&amp;D until I started visiting this site.  Some of you guys are just unreal!  <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/smile.png" title="Smiling" alt="Smiling" class="smiley-content"/></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I still haven't checked it out yet, but Violet Dawn really sounds interesting (mainly because it sounds a bit exotic).  It's a bit more obscure however, and I don't know how good the setting is (and sadly, they only released about 5-6 books)</p>

<p>One D20 company to stay as far away from as you can is Dark Quest Games.  Admittedly, I only looked at one of their products (Enchantresses), full of super crappy spells such as "charm cats".  (I'm not making that up, BTW)</p>

<p>Arcanis is another D20 setting that's considered very, very good.</p>

<p>For ****s and giggles, I would recommend Mongoose Publishing's Encyclopaedia Arcane: Nymphology and Quintessential Temptress.  These are adult books that deal with sex in the D&amp;D world, and includes in-depth rules for running bordellos.  There's plenty of humorous material, as well.</p>

<p>Mongoose Publishing's other works aren't particularly liked-- they're rather meh, and most of the Quintessentials materials have similar things covered in official D&amp;D products.  (One exception I can think of off my head is the seasonal magic for druids in Quintessential Druid II.<br />
The Quintessential Fighter II also gives a system of maneuvers for fighters and monks with VERY similar mechanics to 3.5 psionics.<br />
Their Slayers Guides aren't particularly great, either.  Most of the materials in these books either contradict the D&amp;D canon, or more commonly, are more of a compilation of information already given in D&amp;D products throughout the decades.</p>

<p>One interesting Mongoose book that I would recommend however is Encyclopaedia Arcane: Crossbreeds.  This thing gives really in-depth rules for making crossbreeds (mainly magically).  Though we're talking more "owlbear" type crossbreeds rather than "half blue, half black dragon" types (though the rules could be used for that).</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Hyena,</p>

<p>What you talked about is more or less what I was trying to drive home.  The OGL rush brought such a sudden blitzkrieg of product to the market - with companies springing up basically overnight - that I had no way to evaluate more than a small percentage of it.</p>

<p>But it was my nagging suspicion that the vast majority of it was "meh" as you so succinctly put it.  How many more times can you buy a "Complete Guide to xxx" without it being little more than a regurgitation of a product that has already been done several times.</p>

<p>Rip,</p>

<p>You mentioned several OGL era products you found to be worthy - but my question is:  did any of them do anything revolutionary or novel?  Obviously some of those companies were of higher quality than others, and therefore had much higher production value to what they put out there.  But even the most slick packaging, nice artwork, and added "goodies" don't do much for me if there's little meat on the bones.</p>

<p>I mentioned in my 2nd post in this thread the redundancy of hundreds of settings out there that follow the traditional "medieval europe" or LotR model of fantasy.  No matter how well detailed one of these settings is, it's still more of the same.  You can add elaborate political histories, details of great wars of the past, modes of dress for each tier of the societal caste, holy days and religious ceremonies, etc.  You can even devise an elaborate weather system that tells me it will be 91 degrees with a 29.94 barometric reading on the 8th day of the month of BlisterHigh in the Year of the Slavering Were-Weasel.... but how does that make for compelling adventure/story-telling?</p>

<p>This is why I maintain that that period of the mid 80's to mid 90's was an umatched surge of creative inspiration.  I guess I can't change anyone's mind here, but to me that was the Golden Age - Planescape, Dark Sun, Ravenloft, (and to a lesser extent the more traditional-like settings of FR and Dragonlance) represented an amazing diversity of gaming material - where each product line offered such a vastly *different* gaming experience from each other.</p>

<p>Rip, those newer products you mentioned - do any of them divert significantly enough from the standard fantasy setting to offer a different gaming experience?  I know Eberron has that whole "magic as technology" theme going, but that doesn't do a whole lot for me.  Could you give me a quick rundown on what some of those other settings do, thematically, to distance themselves from another Middle Earth knock-off?</p>

<p>Oh and how the hell do I activate bold/italics/underline on this forum.  Sorry I haven't been around here much.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>For <span style="font-weight:bold">BOLD</span>, you type (ignoring the quotation marks) "[" "b" "]" to denote the begining and "[" "/" "b" "]" to denote the end of bold</p>

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>""I mentioned in my 2nd post in this thread the redundancy of hundreds of settings out there that follow the traditional "medieval europe" or LotR model of fantasy.""</p>

<p>That's why Violet Dawn is such an interesting concept.  It much more closely follows the Dark Sun model than the typical Mideval model (I think there is some space exploration in Violet Dawn as well).</p>

<p>Another setting that sounds interesting and different (bud sadly is in Portugese only) is Tormenta.  Once again, we have a world that follows the Dark Sun/Ravenloft model.</p>

<p>This is from the wiki page.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Tormenta is a word in Portuguese that means storm. A magic storm threatens the world's lives.<br />
The scenario is Arton, the main continent, where is the known world. The coast is bad for sail and the seas are not explored.</span></p>

<p>From their website:<br />
<span style="font-style:italic">An Alien World<br />
Crimson sunlight refracts among the crystals of the Forest of Waethe, where reptilian beasts feed on the mystic energies that resonate in the air. Bones the height of mountains arc toward the sky across the Throne of Karnn-the remains of godbeasts dead for millennia, but still the goal of pilgrims. Within the Whitemarsh, swamp vapors coalesce into spirits and illusions, and only the natives can determine one from the other. In the Kaarad Lands, rivers of flesh churn under the watch of wary druids.<br />
      Avadnu's environments are as strange and distinctive as the beings which inhabit them. Pastoral fields and lush green forests are cherished as refuges in a world where nature is as frightening as it is nourishing. But Avadnu's peoples have adapted to their land, draping themselves in living leather and riding six-legged mokara on long journeys. Secretive guilds collect flowers that make the weak invincible and foolish kings wise. Clay rich in calite-the metal that dilutes magic-is more valuable than gold.<br />
      Travelers through Avadnu must learn to expect the alien in every aspect of their lives. But learning is difficult in a world where scholars are few. . .</p>

<p>A World of Mystery<br />
Wars recent and old have devastated hopes for unity in a dangerous land. Ancient kingdoms know little of their neighbors, and rely on the legends of bards for information on regions beyond their influence. Colleges of wizardry struggle for each piece of magical lore they collect, and are reluctant to use what they have. The followers of the old gods are a minority, their faith shrinking as the worship of spirits and godbeasts grows and the inward-looking philosophy of Vohalden wins the minds of nobles and peasants.<br />
      At the fringes of memory and consciousness, the Void and its ravenous denizens linger. The xxyth await their chance to end all creation, fulfilling the mandate given to them by a jealous god. Few of Avadnu's people remember the last time the xxyth entered their world, and xxythite cultists exploit this forgetfulness to expand their power.<br />
      Knowledge is a rare commodity on Avadnu, but not one often sought. Survival is foremost on the minds of all but the privileged. The chitinous vulnar are among the few cultures whose organization spans the continent of Kaelandar, and many of their beneficiaries also fear the control of their economic network. The arcanists of Morgathog perform bizarre experiments in their citadel while their people starve in the desert or are captured as slaves.<br />
      Valiant individuals may be able to turn away the fog of mystery, but whether or not they choose to do so is another question. . .  </span></p>

<p>Like I said, we've got something here with a similar concept to Dark Sun.  (I thought there was also some space travel involved, but I think I must have confused that with another setting...)</p>

<p>Another interesting book that I've heard good things about (but never looked at it myself) is the Redhurst Academy of Magic (a wizards' academy that can shift between prime worlds)</p>

<p>Possibly more original still is the Dragonmech setting.  Now, I have not looked at it myself, so I don't know how good the books are, but the concept is unique.  An excerpt:<br />
<span style="font-style:italic">DragonMech is a medieval fantasy campaign setting unlike any other. It is a world destroyed by relentless lunar meteor storms called the lunar rain. To survive, the surface races have used magical and mechanical means to build thousand-foot-tall city-mechs, which now house most of civilization. Kingdoms have been replaced by mobile mechdoms, and the mounted knight is anachronistic in the face of steam-powered combat mechs. While lunar creatures launch invasions from the skies, fleets of smoke-belching steam-mechs battle for scarce supplies of wood, steel, and coal.</span></p>

<p>There's also Broken.  (no, it's not a parody system).  I haven't looked at this one either, and it's not quite as original as the above, but:<br />
<span style="font-style:italic">Broken is a fantasy campaign set in space after the destruction of the world of Solaris 40 years ago. Once richly populated with magic and psionics, home to a variety of cultures, Broken explores the story of a civilization reduced to fragments drifting in the void, softening stone so it can be eaten, recycling precious food and air and struggling to create a trace of heat for comfort. Come explore space fantasy with a grim dose of reality where there is no air and normal sails do not work.</span><br />
Only problem is that this would be difficult to encorporate into a Spelljammer setting, I would think.</p>

<p>Ave Moloch 3E/2E sounds pretty good, as well (though it sounds like anything other than the core book kinda sucks)<br />
Excerpts once again:<br />
<span style="font-style:italic">a post-cataclysmic mediaeval fantasy world with steampunk inventions and a Wild West attitude.<br />
...<br />
Due to the catacysmic events of the past, much of the population has been living underground or floating high above, and only the past couple of hundred years has seen more than the most adventurous venture out on the surface. Now both magic and technology are being harnessed to make the surface a fit place on which to live again. Much knowledge, especially the detailed history of what took place, has been lost; but some remains to be discovered.<br />
...<br />
basically, fragmented outposts of various sizes each doing their best to survive against the remnants of alien invasions and hostile neighbours. However, different groups bring a range of talents, skills and knowledge to the world community as a whole - there is even a primitive Internet to enable different settlements to keep in touch with one another! Magic exists alongside technology, being of the familiar arcane and divine persuasions as well as 'ancient magic' from which all else stemmed. Most divine magic comes from a belief in oneself rather than in an external deity, as veneration of gods seems to have vanished during the cataclysm and its aftermath... and the gods themselves appear to have gone to sleep. </span></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Eberron is one of the best game worlds that WotC made.  It's pulp fantasy world where they actually try to address how magic shapes the world and the application of it.  Sure that does lead to things such as airships, lightning rails and Warforged, but that's what helps separate it from other WotC settings.  I also favour it because it has a better view about Orcs and Goblins as being civilizations and cultures rather than monsters.  And I like the concepts of Dal Quor, it's version of the Far Realms and the shifting planar influences over the world.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>First, let me clarify my stance on Greyhawk. I mentioned that I respected it's place in the history of D&amp;D, but found some of it to be a bit too goofy. This simple one line blurb was insufficient and dismissive of me.</div></p>

<p>Oh, feel free to be insufficient and dismissive, if you want. I'm not trying to convert you to Greyhawkdom or anything; I was just trying to explain why I personally like it.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>There is, however, a good deal of it that simply turns me off. There's just too many adventures with robots and laser guns, or portals to our own earth, or Alice in Wonderland settings, silly things that I find distasteful.</div></p>

<p>Hm. While recognizing your right to find whatever you want distasteful, and still not trying to evangelize in any way, I'll note that these things are very, very minor parts of the setting. They go basically unmentioned outside of the old, old modules they originally appeared in, and don't affect the setting around them at all. There's only one robots-and-laser-guns adventure, <span style="font-style:italic">Expedition to the Barrier Peaks</span>, and it's never mentioned again. <span style="font-style:italic">Greyhawk Ruins</span> placed a spelljammer in the Barrier Peaks instead. The Alice in Wonderland stuff <span style="font-style:italic">does</span> get an extensive mention quite recently, in 2007's <span style="font-style:italic">Expedition to the Ruins of Greyhawk</span>, but it doesn't affect anything outside a castle created by a mad demigod. There are no official portals to our own Earth in Greyhawk; the adventure "City Beyond the Gate" in Dragon #100 isn't officially placed anywhere on Oerth, though it does mention St. Cuthbert.</p>

<p>There are, of course, similarly silly things in the Realms, notably Elminster's habit of regularly visiting TSR game designers and throwing extravagant parties in Ed Greenwood's basement. Portals to our own Earth was a fundamental part of the Realms as Ed Greenwood originally conceived it (he imagined it as a sort of parallel world where mythological races and beings from Earth disappeared to, thus the name "Forgotten Realms"), though it's mentioned only vaguely in official materials (as the origin of the Mulan people, for example, and probably the origin world of immigrant peoples who brought in several Faerunian deities like Loviatar, Mielikki, Oghma, Tyr, and so on). Just as in Greyhawk, these things don't really affect actual gameplay in the setting in any way.</p>

<p>You should probably avoid Mystara, by the way, cool as I think it sometimes is. It's far, far sillier than Greyhawk ever was, and the robots and laser guns adventure forms a crucial and transformative part of its ancient history, explaining how the setting came to be.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div> Also, most of those iconic mages are simply anagrams or reverse-spellings of Gygax's real life friends that played the game with him (Drawmij = Jim Ward for example).</div></p>

<p>Yeah. The iconic mages aren't such a big deal, since they're only eight NPCs that you really don't have to use in a game (and there are lots and lots of similar anagrams and homages in Planescape books), but it's much harder to ignore the many, many place names in the Greyhawk setting that are anagrams. The Dramidj Ocean, the Duchy of Ulek, the County of Urnst, the City of Gyrax, the Nutherwood, etc. You either have a tolerance for such things or you don't.</p>

<p>Then again, Forgotten Realms has arguably sillier names like Marco Volo (named for Marco Polo, of course) and Regis and Cattie-brie (named for talk-show hosts Regis and Cathy Lee, groan). </p>

<p>You know what setting has really great names? Birthright. </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div> If Gygax were alive today I'm sure he'd tell me I'm taking my fantasy too seriously</div></p>

<p>He'd probably be more polite than that, but yeah.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>I guess I'm simply not familiar enough with Sargent's reworked vision of Greyhawk to know the difference.</div></p>

<p>Like I said, it's a lot darker, grittier, more fully-fleshed out, more flavorful, and more intense. Carl Sargent ran his own Greyhawk campaign for many years, and he portrays the world in a very straight-faced, dramatic manner, ignoring any of the silly parts (though he's stuck with the names).</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>how many high fantasy settings with the traditional "medieval europe" archetype do you need?</div></p>

<p>None. You don't need any, really, and it might be more interesting to run a campaign where "medieval Europe" isn't even an option. I also thought it might be fun to run a Planescape campaign where the only prime-material world was a fantastic version of our Earth. </p>

<p>I've often argued that it was pointless to use Greyhawk and the Forgotten Realms in the same campaign because they're so similar. To me, though, Greyhawk is a basic part of the D&amp;D "story," so it's hard for me to conceive of Planescape without Oerth and its events somewhere in it. The demon lords Fraz'Urb'luu, Graz'zt, and Zuggtmoy are intimately tied in with the world (Lolth, Imix, and Demogorgon are as well, to a lesser extent), so it'd require some reworking to fit them into another. The Forgotten Realms seems less fundamental to me, but it's part of the story too, and I like the idea of accepting all things D&amp;D into a greater history - yeah, even including the 4th edition stuff. </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>You mentioned several OGL era products you found to be worthy - but my question is: did any of them do anything revolutionary or novel?</div></p>

<p>Most of the ones I mentioned were more things I thought were useful for Planescape than prime worlds specifically, which was contrary to the purpose of the thread, so I apologize. Of what I mentioned, the most innovative/distinctive world is Serran, the world of the <span style="font-style:italic">Arcana Unearthed</span>/<span style="font-style:italic">Arcana Evolved</span> RPG (based on the d20 OGL, so fairly close to 3rd edition D&amp;D, but with entirely different classes and non-Tolkienesque races). <span style="font-style:italic">Beyond Countless Doorways</span> is a planar supplement introducing a number of distinctive worlds and planes (designed by Monte Cook, Wolfgang Baur, Colin McComb, and Ray Vallese), so the emphasis is very much on making things as fantastic and nonstandard as possible.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.thepiazza.org.uk/bb/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=2289" class="bb-url">Here</a> is an attempt to fit all the worlds detailed in Malhavoc Press products into the same crystal sphere.</p>

<p>Worlds (not all of them d20) that I think are particularly flavorful, nonstandard, and distinct include:</p>

<p>Talislanta (just about everything published for the setting is available for free <a href="http://talislanta.com/?page_id=5" class="bb-url">here</a>)<br />
Glorantha (<a href="http://www.glorantha.com/" title="http://www.glorantha.com/">http://www.glorantha.com/</a>)<br />
Tékumel (see <a href="http://www.tekumel.com/" title="http://www.tekumel.com/">http://www.tekumel.com/</a>)</p>

<p>Oathbound sounds interesting, but I don't know much about it. <a href="http://www.geeknative.com/396/oathbound/" class="bb-url">Here's a review</a>.</p>

<p>I'm intrigued by the Skyrealms of Jorune for its very non-standard alien races, but I know virtually nothing about it. <a href="http://www.jorune.org/" title="http://www.jorune.org/">http://www.jorune.org/</a></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><span style="font-style:italic">You should probably avoid Mystara, by the way, cool as I think it sometimes is. It's far, far sillier than Greyhawk ever was, and the robots and laser guns adventure forms a crucial and transformative part of its ancient history, explaining how the setting came to be.</span></p>

<p>I don't think it's dumb at all personally, granted I enjoy anime and JRPGS (in which "ancient advanced civilization" is a near-universal cliche) and have been exposed to plenty of Atlantis stories.  And really, that's what Blackmoor is modelled after-- the modern mythology of Atlantis, Lemuria, and Mu, which (esp. the first one) new-agers, UFO enthusiasts, and Falun Gong practitioners claim had advanced technology such as anti-gravity flying devices, electricity, flush toilets, and nuclear reactors.</p>

<p>Expedition to Castle Greyhawk/The Ruins of Greyhawk however (ALL editions of it), along with Dungeonland and Land Beyond the Magic Mirror I did indeed find to be ridiculous.  Luckily, the vast majority of "joke" modules are limited to 1E and OD&amp;D.</p>

<p>The main purpose of the Barrier Peaks module, if not the ONLY purpose of it was to give the DM and players an adventure/plot device and rules to transfer their D&amp;D characters to TSR's Alternity game.  The only reason it was placed in the Greyhawk setting is because that was where most of the generic adventures were placed, and it followed the general 3x generic formula of placing modules, backdrops, etc. or taking deities, characters, etc. from the Greyhawk setting minus any reference or appearance of the Suel, Baklunish, or other Greyhawk cultures.  In 2E this can be seen in the following adventues: Monstrous Arcana series, Night Below, Rod of Seven Parts, Gates of Firestorm Peak, Axe of the Dwarvish Lords, Return to the Tomb of Horrors, Return to White Plume Mountain (admittedly I'm not 100% sure about the lack of cultural references for those last two)  The Shattered Circle lacks the Greyhawk logo and is also passed off as a "generic" module, but makes Greyhawk cultural references (the Shattered Circle is spoken of in Suloise legend/mythology)  I believe that Return to White Plume Mountain and Return to the Tomb of Horrors are the same way, while Rod of Seven Parts and Gates of Firestorm Peak lack references to Greyhawk cultures.</p>

<p>""I guess I'm simply not familiar enough with Sargent's reworked vision of Greyhawk to know the difference.""<br />
Like I said, it's a lot darker, grittier, more fully-fleshed out, more flavorful, and more intense. Carl Sargent ran his own Greyhawk campaign for many years, and he portrays the world in a very straight-faced, dramatic manner, ignoring any of the silly parts (though he's stuck with the names).</p>

<p>Sargent's Greyhawk is actually incredibly similar to 1E and 2E Forgotten Realms, actually, save that there are many areas and elements that he never fleshed out (there are several deities, such as Keoghtom *sp?*, who never got fleshed out at all beyond the Deities of Greyhawk charts that lists basic divine and portfolio info, and the continents beyond the Flaeness are even more woefully underdeveloped than those in the Forgotten Realms.  Likewise, there are only specialty priest kits for a handfull of Greyhawk's many, many organizations.  Regrettably, just like in 3E, Sargent only fleshes out/focuses on a handfull of about 20-25 of Greyhawk's 100+-some-odd powers.)</p>

<p>That reminds me, one thing that never made sense to me:<br />
Iuz the Evil.  He's the son of Graz'zt and Iggwilv.  Iggwilv, the witch-queen, the hot temptress who managed to bag the sexiest Tanar'ri male in all the Abyss.  Yet Iuz looks nothing like either parent-- he's instead an ugly, diseased old man.  Why is this?  It makes no sense.  Too many dominant Baba Yaga genes?</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>All of the Greyhawk deities eventually got fleshed out in the Living Greyhawk Gazetteer and the Living Greyhawk Journal #3. Iuz was invented and described long before Gygax decided who his parents were. Initially, he was maybe a human who had evolved into a demon,or a son of Orcus, but Gygax made him Graz'zt and Iggwilv's son in order to tie him into the Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth backstory, which introduced Iggwilv and Graz'zt to the game.</p>

<p>Keoghtom was fully detailed in the 1983 World of Greyhawk boxed set, and originally in Dragon Magazine, along with Heward, Murlynd, and Kelanen.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>As for the in-character reasons, Iggwilv isn't a blood-relation of Baba Yaga; she's adopted, so Iuz doesn't carry any of her genes. However, keep in mind that the appearance that Iggwilv normally shows isn't her true one. Her true form is supposed to be a shriveled, hideous old hag, very much like Iuz's "Iuz the Old" form.</p>

<p>Yet Iuz only looks like a withered old man some of the time; the rest of the time, he looks like a bloated, red-skinned demon. He does look more like Orcus than Graz'zt, but tanar'ri bloodlines are chaotic enough that this isn't necessarily indicative of his ancestry. A number of Graz'zt's children don't closely resemble him (Thraxxia, for example, looks like a standard alu-fiend). </p>

<p>Iuz is supposed to have looked entirely different, being remarkably handsome, until the battle between Iggwilv and Graz'zt (when Graz'zt escaped from Iggwilv's control) took place in his presence, the forces unleashed in that melee tearing him in two, creating the "withered old mannikin" form and "bloated demon" form he switches between today.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>When it comes to some other WotC game worlds, there's the Stardrive setting which was the "core" setting of the Alternity System, where I actually take a couple things from it to use in D&amp;D.</p>

<p>I've actually covered the Mechalus/Aleerin before through my article of <a href="080401/planescape-through-vernian-lens-steamplanes_.html" class="bb-url">Steampunk Planescape</a>.  But there are other things I'd throw in, such as the I'krl Imperium or "The Externals" as a bunch of races that serve the interests of beings from the Far Realm.</p>

<p>Another setting would be Dark Matter, which I came up with a brilliant idea to combine with Masque of the Red Death and D20 Modern: Urban Arcana into one setting.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

Even though I'm sure those two absolutely hate each others' guts (overlapping portfolios), there's no way that Graz'zt wouldn't tap that (even if he was certain it was a trap... he'd just set up a ruse or something; no way he'd turn down a fling with the sexiest female in the Abyss..).  Then again, I wouldn't be surprised if Graz'zt has done damn near every decent-looking female Demon Lord in the Abyss (and maybe a few of the better looking guys, too...

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>There's some seriously bad blood between Graz'zt and Malcanthet. Graz'zt is "chief among her enemies." (Dragon #353) Graz'zt did indeed want to "tap that," but when Malcanthet refused him, he sent his armies to invade her plane (she just barely managed to turn them back). Since then it's been mostly a cold war between the two, each sending spies and double agents into each other's realms. Recently Graz'zt managed to embarrass Malcanthet by posing as her and seducing Kostchtchie, something that didn't bother him but was terrible for her reputation. Kostchtchie didn't take it well either. </p>

<p>That said, there's a very nice scene at the beginning of <span style="font-style:italic">Expedition to the Demonweb Pits</span> where Graz'zt and Malcanthet put aside their differences, despite obvious paranoia and hatred, to plot against Lolth.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

There are, of course, similarly silly things in the Realms, notably Elminster's habit of regularly visiting TSR game designers and throwing extravagant parties in Ed Greenwood's basement. Portals to our own Earth was a fundamental part of the Realms as Ed Greenwood originally conceived it (he imagined it as a sort of parallel world where mythological races and beings from Earth disappeared to, thus the name "Forgotten Realms"), though it's mentioned only vaguely in official materials (as the origin of the Mulan people, for example, and probably the origin world of immigrant peoples who brought in several Faerunian deities like Loviatar, Mielikki, Oghma, Tyr, and so on). Just as in Greyhawk, these things don't really affect actual gameplay in the setting in any way.</div></p>

<p>Yeah I'm aware of a good deal of the silliness attached to the history of the Forgotten Realms, but since this thread originally was about (wait, there was a point at one time?) the mid 80's to mid 90's TSR/WotC worlds, I was pretty much sticking to the revised version of FR - in which just about all of that is done away with.  The subtitle of "Herein lie the lost lands" was dropped from the official logo, and most traces of it being linked to our Earth were removed to my knowledge (other than the importation of the Mulan people - which is easily ignorable).</p>

<p>You know what, the more info you give me in this thread, the more I see how very similar Greyhawk and FR are.  Both are started by some rather eccentric fellows - Gygax and Greenwood.  Both incorporate a high degree of iconic and formative elements of what we collectively call "the D&amp;D game" (Greyhawk to a higher degree).  Both involve quite a bit of silliness instilled from their creators (Elminster's parties as you mentioned, as well as what we've already discussed in Oerth).  And lastly, both received considerable facelifts in that same 10 year span of time I've continually referenced.</p>

<p>It's funny, after your first reply you piqued my interest in Greyhawk enough for me to realize I needed to some research of my own.  As I said, I recognized many of its iconic contributions to the game, but I had only ever used it as a resource to "drag and drop" certain elements (monsters, treasures, dungeons) into other game worlds, and never as a fully realized setting of its own.</p>

<p>One article I read in particular seemed to contrast sharply with what's been said in this thread.  Maybe the author simply had a strong bias, but it almost seemed like he was trying to vilify Sargent - as though he was some corporate stooge who took this magnificent world and crushed it's spirit with his soulless, uninspired remake.  I know the split between Gygax and TSR was acrimonious, and perhaps this author was merely slanting his review towards what he considered "true Greyhawk" and not Sargent's "imposter".  But from everything I've read in this thread, it seems like Sargent's vision of Oerth would be right up my alley.  As you can readily deduce from this thread, I obviously prefer the grittier, more realistic (as far as worlds with dragons and wizards can be) versions over the light-hearted, goofy ones.</p>

<p>At any rate, I probably shouldn't have even mentioned FR in my original post, as the point of it was to highlight what was, in my mind, a burst of unparallelled creativity during that ~10 year period.  Really FR didn't do anything groundbreaking, and I probably only mentioned it because the setting has always been near and dear to my heart.  Hindsight being 20/20, I should've limited the conversation to the settings that truly jumped out as being revolutionary and distinguished from the traditional medieval europe model - Ravenloft, Dark Sun, and Planescape to be specific.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, it's been an interesting conversation, and I feel like I've gleaned quite a bit of useful information, as well as received a much needed history lesson on Oerth.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Basically. Some Greyhawk fans still bear a lot of ill will toward everything that happened after Gygax's buy-out, and some don't consider anything written after that point to be true 'hawk. The fact that a number of countries were devastated by the Greyhawk Wars (which were, if I recall correctly, Jeff Grubb's initial idea, and fleshed out by David "Zeb" Cook) left the impression that the setting had been needlessly trashed, its theme of dynamic balance between good and evil replaced by darkness and woe (though hope was also a theme - it was called From the Ashes, after all). I actually think Roger E. Moore's attempts to bring the setting back into a state of balance in 1998 were a mixed bag, cutting some of Sargent's themes off abruptly and artificially instead of giving them time to develop. The question of whether or not it's ethical to continue to expand something that had been someone else's personal creation after you've taken control of it against their will... well, it's dubious, but I can enjoy the results without bearing any personal responsibility for how they came to be. TSR is long gone, anyway.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Some people didn't like the addition of nonweapon proficiencies, character kits, and specialty priests, some didn't like the loss of the monk, barbarian, illusionist, assassin, cavalier, and original bard classes, some people didn't like the changes to the ranger class, and some people just didn't like the way the new books were organized. And some few people just try to avoid everything non-Gygaxian. </p>

<p>But I don't agree with Hyena that most people who avoided the post-Greyhawk Wars line were "1e fanboys." A lot of them just had established campaigns that had gone in a different direction, so they didn't like the metaplot. It's no different from Dragonlance fans who didn't like the Age of Mortals, Dark Sun fans who preferred the setting before the fall of the sorcerer-king of Tyr, Mystara fans who didn't like the results of the Wrath of the Immortals, Forgotten Realms fans who didn't like the Time of Troubles (or Spellplague), or Planescape fans who didn't like the Faction War. Any massive shake-up of a setting divides the fanbase; edition changes were the least of it. </p>

<p>I think that line also failed because it was called From the Ashes and not simply Greyhawk, so it wasn't obvious that this was the complete campaign setting and not just an expansion of the out of print original World of Greyhawk setting. </p>

<p>I understand why TSR thought at the time that Greyhawk should be clearly different from the generic fantasy of the Forgotten Realms if it was going to continue, and therefore decided to turn it into a war-torn, evil-dominated dark-fantasy setting in order to set it apart. I also understand why for a lot of Greyhawk and D&amp;D fans, that wasn't what they were looking for, so they skipped it.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><span style="font-style:italic">...I didn't realize there were 1E fanboys. 1E + UA was basically identical to 2E - it was probably less of a change than 3e to 3.5 was, even - what's their problem with 2E?</span><br />
I can't remember exactly, but there were things about 2E that they most certainly disliked. Basically, for starters, because Gygax didn't make it.  I can't remember their other reasons, though I think part of it is that they hate that there are more rules (rather than leaving everything up to the DM's whim and player creativity) more or less.  Also, a lot of the 1E fanboys hated the 1E UA and claim that it was just a cheap piece of crap book TSR had Gygax make because the company was hurting for cash.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Some people didn't like the addition of nonweapon proficiencies, character kits, and specialty priests, some didn't like the loss of the monk, barbarian, illusionist, assassin, cavalier, and original bard classes, some people didn't like the changes to the ranger class, and some people just didn't like the way the new books were organized. And some few people just try to avoid everything non-Gygaxian.</span><br />
Yeah, that prettymuch sums it up.  That and their seething hatred of the Player's Option supplements and called shots.  NWP's was a huge factor, however.  Also, the monk actually did make several comebacks in 2E, but it was a divine warrior class sorta like the Paladin and Ranger rather than a pure warrior class.<br />
Aside from the pain in the ass that NWPs were, they also made things a bit easier for the players survival-wise.  Where characters before had only a 1% chance of spotting certain dangerous things (including things that even rogues cannot spot, such as camoflaged killer moss or something), they now have between a 2-20% chance of spotting.</p>

<p>I wasn't aware that the 2E Greyhawk setting was a gritty dystopian one, though.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Aha, okay.  I guess I can understand people not liking those aspects (and I forgot that monk, barbarian, and assassin were dropped in the transition).</p>

<p>Which I have to say, I never understood.  I mean, I get the fervor that a lot of fans of the setting would have against the idea of Oerth being a dying world, but the idea of Oerth being in decline was nothing new.  The very first thing you read in the original Glossography, one of the first Greyhawk publications (I think the box set was the second after Supplement 2?) was how magic in Oerth was within a mere four centuries of the then-present day a fading art.  In my personal canon, I'd always tied that OHG comment into the whole "coming end of the Epoch of Magic" thing.  In fact, I'd always assumed that was the <span style="text-decoration:underline">intent</span>.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Possibly. The fading magic thing was just something added by the editor to somehow explain the existence of roleplaying books describing the setting in-character. The implication was that Oerth somehow becomes our modern Earth, or something close enough to it that it evolves a company called TSR that markets roleplaying games based on on the mythical, magical past.

<p>I think the "dying Oerth" thing was more the Blood War spreading to Oerth and being about to destroy it (as first mentioned in the Codex of Mordenkainen in 1991's <span style="font-style:italic">Monstrous Compendium Outer Planes Appendix</span>). There was a huge invasion of tanar'ri under the auspices of Iuz, and the baatezu were steering the Malachite Throne of the Great Kingdom of Aerdy, and I think it was only a matter of time before both sides decided to use Oerth as a battleground to duke it out in person. Except the 1998 revival cut that plotline  short with an off-screen deus ex machina (partially retconned in 1999's <span style="font-style:italic">Guide to Hell</span>, which said only the tanar'ri were deus ex machina'd while the baatezu remained in secret). </p>

<p>The objection was more, "Oh, Colin McComb, you bastard, they've already killed off Greyhawk OOC just a few years ago, why'd you have to kill it off IC too?" </p>

<p>I actually like the idea of Oerth as a dying world, though. It has a Vancian flavor to it that I think is very appropriate.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Indeed.  And I know the meta-reason for it, yeah, but I liked the idea of that merely being a symptom of the whole thing and all.  I believe there was an article on Boccob in Dragon not long before Paizo lost the magazine that mentioned the fading magic as a future problem of his he was hoping to stop but knew he couldn't possibly?</p>

<p>And I suppose the question then is "what does it mean that Oerth is dying?"  But that's probably a question for another thread, I imagine.  Probably another forum too; it's not exactly a Planescape question.  But then again, I can't imagine it could be posted on Canonfire without getting most people arguing the premise itself.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>ripvanwormer</em> wrote:</div>But I don't agree with Hyena that most people who avoided the post-Greyhawk Wars line were "1e fanboys." A lot of them just had established campaigns that had gone in a different direction, so they didn't like the metaplot. It's no different from Dragonlance fans who didn't like the Age of Mortals, Dark Sun fans who preferred the setting before the fall of the sorcerer-king of Tyr, Mystara fans who didn't like the results of the Wrath of the Immortals, Forgotten Realms fans who didn't like the Time of Troubles (or Spellplague), or Planescape fans who didn't like the Faction War. Any massive shake-up of a setting divides the fanbase; edition changes were the least of it. </div></p>

<p>It seems to me, the reason for this is: any time a large, world-changing metaplot is introduced to a game setting, it rarely makes the world more compelling or interesting.  Often it seems to be nothing more than <span style="font-style:italic"> change for the sake of change</span>.  My cynical side says these are nothing but a money grab, looking to sell large amounts of product rather than to truly improve an established setting.  And well.... they're a business, so I guess that's to be expected.</p>

<p>Some small number of metaplots actually do make a setting more compelling, some are horrible and to be ignored at all costs, with the majority falling somewhere in between and can be considered the normal evolution of a game setting.</p>

<p>Hyena mentioned edition changes as a cause of "fanboyism" but I'm not sure why anyone would view an edition change as being even remotely as threatening as a metaplot.  The rules by which you adventure are simply a system to adjudicate the actions your players take in these worlds and assign a somewhat reasonable percentage chance for them to pass/fail at said actions.  I don't care if you're using 1e, 2e, 3e, 3.5, 4e, or GURPS for that matter - as long as you have a competent DM, good players, and an entertaining storyline.</p>

<p>And if you want to play a mounted warrior with a strong moral code, does it matter if he's called a knight, a paladin, a cavalier, or a chevalier?  There are certain archetypes of the fantasy genre we all know and expect, and minor details and classifications seem, to me, to be largely irrelevant.</p>

<p>So while I don't care about edition changes (although to be fair I do feel a suspicious reluctance concerning 4e, which I have not checked out), it has less to do with the actual mechanics of a new ruleset, and more to do with the adventure content and game settings that have been produced in those timeframes.</p>

<p>So for me, it has nothing to do with being a "fanboy", but rather a belief that nothing since the Planescape, Dark Sun, Ravenloft age (and Greyhawk/FR to a lesser extent) has come out that can hold a candle to those wonderful settings.  Now perhaps that marks me as some archaic dinosaur, but I don't see any products in the 3e/4e timelines that can contest this.</p>

<p>EDIT:  oh, and very poor form on the re-imagining of the planar cosmology.  There was NO reason to change this up.  Planescape absolutely nailed it, they had such an elegantly simple, yet wonderfully rich organization to the entire multiverse - and now we have garbage like the Elemental Soup or whatever it is being called.</p>

<p>I believe this is where the majority of my 4e disdain comes from.  The change from 2e to 3e for my group was seemless, as it was only mechanical gameplay differences and didn't effect any storylines in progress.  I simply cannot justify in my mind the entire multiverse being turned on end and re-envisioned.  It involves either completely scrapping an existing campaign, retro-fitting what has already occurred in your campaign to work in the new setting, or creating such an absurd metaplot that can entirely reshape the alignment of all existence.</p>

<p>No thanks.  Why did they have to mess with perfection?</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>As far as I know, most of the 1E fanboys I've been mentioning don't even LIKE Greyhawk.  They usually build their own campaign setting from scratch.  They like the modules (particularly the Tomb of Horrors), but not the campaign settings, and they hate 1E Unearthed Arcana and 2E-4E because they're more rules-intensive rather than just letting the DM do whatever he decides on a whim or based on player creativity.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">There was NO reason to change this up. Planescape absolutely nailed it, they had such an elegantly simple, yet wonderfully rich organization to the entire multiverse - and now we have garbage like the Elemental Soup or whatever it is being called.</span></p>

<p>I agree 100%, but nonetheless, I still recognize the class balance and beauty of 4E's powers system.  I've had many people (not on this board) deride me for such hangups, stating that if I want The Great Wheel and the Elemental, Paraelemental, and Quasielemental planes back, then I should just do that, and that if I'm not creative enough to come up for 4E rules for it, then I have no business whatsoever being a DM.<br />
Granted, the only people who argue this have ALWAYS thrown out all traces of 2E-4E's campaign-related rules, including alignments (they remove the alignment system altogether except in the context of monsters and villainous NPCs), planar cosmology, cosmological history, monster backgrounds (most of them just put all fiends, both demon, devil, on the same side, remove the 'loths altogether because "they're stupid and useless", and have a single lower plane and a single upper plane which contains only angels, removing the archons, eladrins, and the guardinals.  The Slaad are likewise removed or placed on the lower plane.)   I haven't asked them much about the content of their campaign settings, though from what I've heard from them, I suspect they ALWAYS involve post-apocalyptic campaign settings where the whole world is either a midieval Fallout setting (as per the game series), post-Zombie invasion, or post-Demon invasion, and the campaign consists of a hack-and-slash to free the world (except sometimes in the Fallout setting) &gt;_&lt;  They're also not very pleasant people to post around.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">No thanks. Why did they have to mess with perfection?</span><br />
Basically, they wanted to start over, I guess.  They were apparently sick and tired of referencing to 40 years of backstory material.  I don't understand it either, because with the way the 4E multiverse is, the cosmology basically is tipped towards chaotic alignment.  Supposedly most of the changes they made in 4E were player-requested, though I highly doubt this was the case for the cosmology.  I think they merely did this because they wanted to create a new setting.  I haven't looked at it myself, but supposedly the 4E Manual of the Planes includes rules for using The Great Wheel and traditional 3x inner planar cosmologies.  The problem of course is that The Great Wheel is not part of the official setting, and that 4E is so much more different than previous editions, that it would be difficult to retrofit the monster/etc. rules to the bestiary, paragon paths, etc.  It's the most irksome thing about 4E by far, IMO, though their new Essentials product line may well top EVEN that (there's some scary language in the book they've released thus far, and oh my gosh does the book suck horribly.<br />
First of all, the rules aren't even COMPLETE, they're not well explained, and the rules as given don't flow together very well.  It sounds more like you won't get the complete rules unless you buy all friggin' 10 products of the line.<br />
Second, they apparently didn't hire a proofreader; that thing's loaded with typos, and probably errors as well.<br />
Third, the option for every single class sucks.<br />
Basically, it appears to have been an attempt to draw back the 1E-3E fans by eliminating 95% of the powers system.  Really?  Is this really the top complaint of 3x lovers?  <br />
Unfortunately, all it really does is bring back most of the worst aspects of 3x, such as the fighter not being able to hold his own against the other classes, and yet, the full casting classes are somehow WEAKENED.)<br />
Scary thing is, the book/website states something along the line that Essentials will "shape the future products of 4E" or some such, but ALSO states that it's an introductory product line, akin to the Rules Cyclopedia/D&amp;DBasic... Yes, they're claiming both those things at the same time, WTF?!  Honestly, the Powers system is one of the few things about 4E that I like.  Wizards is essentially making a product line that nobody is going to enjoy. </p>

<p>Back to the subject, the people I'm referring to as "fanboys" are the ones who see no redeeming value whatsoever in the other settings, and a lot of them have flat out refused to even try out 3.5 and 4E.   Some even refused to try out 3.0.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Yeah, I know what you mean.  Twice in my ~25 year history of playing D&amp;D have I gone outside of my normal gaming group to join an unfamiliar crew, and both times the sessions went more or less like this:</p>

<p>DM:  you enter the room and see.... a Red Dragon!!<br />
Players:  we kill it!!<br />
DM:  you guys are awesome, have some treasure.<br />
Players:  we go to the next room.<br />
DM:  you enter the room and see.... a Titan!!<br />
Players:  we kill it!!<br />
DM:  you guys are awesome, have some treasure.</p>

<p>All of which is done with no back story, nothing even remotely approaching tactics or teamwork or interaction with the environment, and barely even a need for dice.  It felt like the DM was randomly flipping through a MM and pulling out whatever looked tough enough to bolster the player's egos, as though the purpose of the game is simply to build super munchkin characters that kill a tarrasque every morning before breakfast.</p>

<p>And that's what I was talking about in my earlier post about <span style="font-style:italic">change simply for the sake of change</span> and not because it does anything at all to improve a setting.  So many novels, modules, campaign plots, etc. have been intricately tied to the Great Wheel and Inner Planes cosmology.  WotC is, in effect, saying <span style="font-style:italic">none of this has happened, start over.</span>  I find it baffling they could see this as a better option when they have years and years of amazingly deep and well developed lore to draw upon.</p>

<p>And what does this do to a DM's campaign continuity if he wants to make the jump?  I ran a 6 year campaign that hinged heavily on discovering portals to, and performing various mission objectives in the various Inner Planes.  4e would turn my work into a hollow shell.  No Blood War?  OMG that is downright blasphemy to my ears.</p>

<p>And no I have no interest in creating a DC Universe-like system with Earth-1, Earth-2, Earth-Prime, etc. where certain events/planar configurations are present in one reality, but not in another.  Hell no.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>All of which is done with no back story, nothing even remotely approaching tactics or teamwork or interaction with the environment, and barely even a need for dice.

<p>I honestly don't see the problem with that.  I mean, I can see that it's not your cup of tea, but if they're having fun, who cares how they play?  The purpose of the game is to have fun, and they were having fun.  I mean, if I can <a href="http://www.koboldquarterly.com/k/front-page6672.php" class="bb-url">quote Colin McComb</a> here:</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>Colin McComb</em> wrote:</div>This is one of the reasons I refuse to get involved in an edition-war discussion. For one thing, I have friends who have worked on both editions, and choosing one over the other is tantamount to choosing sides. For another (and this is really the more important one), <span style="font-style:italic">it’s a stupid argument.</span></p>

<p>People like what they like. They have fun doing what they have fun doing, and for gamers to tear apart other gamers because their style of play isn’t pure enough or it’s too much like a video game or it’s too complicated, or <span style="font-style:italic">whatever</span> the reason: it does not improve our own play. It does not actually make us superior people. Here is what it does: it makes us nincompoops.</p>

<p>Fun is fun, and what one likes another may despise. This does not make one any less than the other, just as vanilla ice cream is not inherently superior to chocolate. This should be self-evident. People will continue to enjoy their brand of fun with or without our input, and as long as their fun does not hurt us, <span style="font-style:italic">we have no right to judge them</span>. Some people like <span style="font-style:italic">Candyland</span>. Some people like chess… wait, let me amend this so people can’t point to one or the other and say, “Ha ha, your edition is <span style="font-style:italic">Candyland</span>!” What I mean is that some people like <span style="font-style:italic">Pandemic</span>. Some people like <span style="font-style:italic">Hive</span>. Both games are excellent in their own right. Both games offer different experiences. Neither is objectively better than the other, but they’re both incredibly fun for what they do. Draw the parallel.</p>

<p>That’s what this is all about. That’s what motivates most of the game designers I know. We come to a common place to share an experience, and that experience should result in <span style="font-style:italic">fun</span>. It should result in memories. It should result in strengthening our ties with each other. It should result in people wanting to play our games.</p>

<p>In the end, we need to be united as gamers and recognize that similarity between us all: we like games. That should be enough. What we do with our games is between us and our games, but the commonality that binds us is an open and loving acceptance of <span style="font-style:italic">play</span>.</div></p>

No Blood War?  OMG that is downright blasphemy to my ears.
</div></p>

<p>Absolutely nothing at all.  I don't like the 4e cosmology either, but all you need to do is not use it in a 4e game.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>VikingLegion</em> wrote:</div>And no I have no interest in creating a DC Universe-like system with Earth-1, Earth-2, Earth-Prime, etc. where certain events/planar configurations are present in one reality, but not in another.  Hell no.</div></p>

<p>I have to admit, I don't understand this complaint.  I mean, if you object to different people's games in the same edition having different cosmologies, it's too late for that; there were tons of 1e, 2e, and 3e people that didn't use the Great Ring.  Though I can't imagine this is what you meant.</p>

<p>But if you're objecting to different settings having different cosmologies, that was the case even before 4e.  There was the Forgotten Realms' cosmology in 3e, of course.  But back in 2e, Weis and Hickman were from the very beginning against Dragonlance's inclusion in Planescape (and the other meta-settings), and always insisted as the creators of the setting that no, it wasn't Primes getting stuff wrong, the cosmology of the universe as understood by the people of Krynn was the correct cosmology for the setting of Dragonlance.  The outcry over the usage of Lord Soth in Ravenloft especially was <span style="text-decoration:underline">huge</span> from them, and they still say that according to true Dragonlance canon it never happened.</p>

Actually, no, that's not what I'm talking about.  They hatch out a campaign setting from scratch and can tell the story just fine, they just don't like the rules telling them how to treat the players, and also make the players figure out the puzzles themselves, independent of their character's INT rating or class.  They don't want intensive rules because they (the DMs here) don't want to be told that they can't do whatever they want to on a whim to the players, essentially.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">WotC is, in effect, saying none of this has happened, start over. I find it baffling they could see this as a better option when they have years and years of amazingly deep and well developed lore to draw upon.</span><br />
Actually, no.  They're basically saying "let's start over, with a new setting, and just borrow a bunch of stuff from the previous 3 editions.  That way, we can retcon whatever crap we want into the core setting, and we no longer have to worry about the painstaking task of back-referencing to make sure we don't contradict 40 years worth of source material.  Huzzah!!!"<br />
I'm guessing, that just like WotC took complaints and suggestions from the fanbase, so they also did with the staff, and the staff's primary complaint is making sure the new stuff they come up with doesn't break the continuity of 40 year's worth of rulebooks, modules, and accessories.  Remember that 1E AND 2E Forgotten Realms rulebooks, campaign expansions, accessories, and adventure modules totals to over 100 books, and that doesn't even include other Realms settings such as Kara Tur, Maztica, and Al Qadim!    <br />
I say this because on Wizards' 3x pages, I've seen this complaint before by the staff on several pages.  This back-referencing is especially difficult for staff members who only joined 10 years ago or less, since they may not have the memory to fall back upon.  <br />
So, looking back on it, I take back what I said in my first paragraph-- I think the retconning and discarding of the previous 3 editions of continuity has to do with complaints from the staff.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">There was the Forgotten Realms' cosmology in 3e, of course.</span><br />
Yes, but it was designed in a way so that it could very, very, <span style="font-weight:bold">VERY</span> easily be converted back into Planescape cosmology.  Hell, with the exception of House of Nature and one or two other "planes", all the FR cosmology planes are just either a divine realm from 2E or a planar layer (e.g. Nishrek), so most of the new deities introduced were pretty easy to place into the old cosmology.  <br />
I am of the opinion that the 3.0 FR staff made it this way intentionally.<br />
It also isn't difficult to restore the inner planes in 3x, which I am working on aspects of right now.<br />
4E is another matter entirely, and I also understand Vikinglegion's complaints because, unlike the 2E-3.0 switch, the 3.5-4.0 switch did not include a conversion guide, which would likely be difficult to execute anyway with martial classes.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">But if you're objecting to different settings having different cosmologies, that was the case even before 4e. There was the Forgotten Realms' cosmology in 3e, of course. But back in 2e, Weis and Hickman were from the very beginning against Dragonlance's inclusion in Planescape (and the other meta-settings), and always insisted as the creators of the setting that no, it wasn't Primes getting stuff wrong, the cosmology of the universe as understood by the people of Krynn was the correct cosmology for the setting of Dragonlance. The outcry over the usage of Lord Soth in Ravenloft especially was huge from them, and they still say that according to true Dragonlance canon it never happened.</p>

<p>Or did you mean something entirely different from those two interpretations?</span><br />
You have a point, there.  TSR tried to make Dragonlance one of the three 2E flagship settings, but due to what you stated above, this plan crashed and burned, and in the end, only Greyhawk and the settings on Abeir-Toril ended up as 'mainstream' settings that flowed with the planar cosmology and Spelljamming.  Ravenloft comes pretty close to being a mainstream one, but the creators get to take comfort in the fact that, Ravenloft is an Ethereal demiplane, and therefore not subject to the same rules as Spelljammer and Planescape.<br />
Dark Sun of course is entirely different with its ruleset, and even the origins of many races/etc. are very different.  The cosmology is also quite different, and the inner planes reflect the dying status of Athas, as though Athas is at the center of the multiverse (or is the only prime plane on it).<br />
Birthright remained separate for the most part, I think.  <br />
Mystara and Red Steel were updated to 2E, but kept their own cosmology and rules save the mention of most of their deities in the Planescape cosmology in Warriors of Heaven.</p>

<p>If 4E were to do things anything like 2E, then the cosmology would NOT have been changed-- rather, the Elemental Chaos and the Astral Sea would be limited to a campaign setting, while the core books, Manual of the Planes, etc. would not be attached to any setting (except MILDLY to Greyhawk-- slightly more mildly than in 3x-- e.g. no Greyhawk human deities would be included in the core pantheon.  Mythological and monstrous deities would be the core pantheon, instead.)</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Jem, did you not read my last post?<br />
The reason people here have such a hangup with 4E fluff and cosmology is because, unlike 3x, it will take a TON of work to retrofit the whole shebang to Planescape rules.  Add to the fact that (despite what people on the Gamefaqs P&amp;P board have claimed), there is no easy way to convert 1-3E rules to 4E rules, because 4E rules are so radically different.  Yes, 3E rules are radically different from 1&amp;2E rules as well, but not nearly as much so-- the most difficult parts of the conversion by far is converting monster stats and converting character kits into prestige classes.  Retrofitting 3.5 rules to the Planescape setting requires a major overhaul that hasn't yet been completed on Planewalker (character rules have been overhauled, and much of the monster conversions are finished, but the planes have yet to be converted, particularly the Deep Ethereal and the Paraelemental and Quasielemental planes.)<br />
With 4E, EVERYTHING is going to be a challenge, because the rules are so drastically altered, including the difficulty level.  Converting monsters will be an even greater challenge, because 4E no longer has the racial subtypes that were present in 3x, and because the alignment system doesn't follow the same rules.<br />
This doesn't require a major overhaul, but rather, a complete reworking of the system.  The basic rules for character creation and play will remain the same, yes, but the rules for monsters will need a drastic overhaul, and the deities and planar cosmology will require monumental changes.<br />
In addition to that, the setting/genre will need to be changed, as both the default setting and FR setting are peri-apocalyptic or post-apocalyptic (in the default setting, there's a major Far-Realm invasion currently going on, while in the FR setting you have the Spellplague.  In the mainstream/flagship and default 2E-3x settings OTOH, the gates to the Far Realm are closed, and creatures from therein are either holdovers from the Firestorm Gate disaster or are new invaders based on a module.)</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>Jem</em> wrote:</div>Remember, folks.  In the end, WotC's copyright police will not come to your house, rifle through your GMing notes, cross out the parts that conflict with canon, and force you to read pretyped text the next time the game runs.</p>

<p>If you want to run a game in which the Faction War never happened, or did and ended a different way, or in which the Beastlands and Arborea switch places, or the Abyss has exactly 666 layers, or the gods all fled the Outer Planes at the advance of the Far Realm and now Good, Evil, Primus, and Ssendam are all gathered on the elemental planes together plotting how to take back the afterlife, you can.  The more different your campaign is from standard, the more work it is, and that's a tradeoff any setting requires.</div></p>

<p>Yes that's true.  One could simply use the mechanics presented in a new edition (i.e. character creation, combat rules, etc.) without incorporating any of the changes to various settings/cosmologies.</p>

<p>But that essentially locks out a great deal of new content that will be developed from that point forward.  I've never been big on running purchased modules, but I'll check them out from time to time for ideas and inspiration.  What am I to do with an adventure wherein the Blood War is non-existent, or various key planes to my campaign have been reconfigured, combined, or dropped out altogether - specifically the lack of separate and distinct Inner Planes.</p>

<p>So the unneccessary upheaval to the cosmology has a twofold effect:  </p>

<p>1.  it attempts to nullify all that has transpired previously - 40 some odd years of history and lore largely erased so lazy developers can get a clean slate.</p>

<p>2.  it freezes out new content, or forces DMs to do a massive amount of reworking to make new adventures "fit".  Sure I can <span style="font-style:italic">freeze</span> gameworlds in certain ages before various metaplots take place, and even ignore the new cosmology, but all official products coming out will quite obviously be of lesser value to me.</p>

<p>A previous poster mentioned this was already happening in earlier editions with Forgotten Realms and Dragonlance departing from the official canonical cosmology.  True, but those were <span style="font-style:italic">easy</span> fixes compared to what is presented now.</p>

<p>And for me it is important to make those fixes, because a big part of the D&amp;D experience is a feeling of <span style="font-style:italic">interconnectivity</span> among the game worlds.  I've read novels and played adventures in Dragonlance, DarkSun, Forgotten Realms, Greyhawk, Planescape, Mystara, Ravenloft, etc. and I really like the thought of someone (very powerful and experienced) being able to traverse all those lands - and that they don't each exist in mutually exclusive bubbles.  I get a kick out of reading Planescape NPC stat blocks that mentioned a cutter is originally from Oerth, or Toril, or wherever else.  For me, having all these lands exist in the same multiverse is paramount to my enjoyment, as I hate the thought of any of this content being potentially excluded from any campaign.</p>

<p>And that is why I simply cannot rectify the new material in my mind.  So my only choice is to ignore the changes, and by association be forced to ignore large portions (that which I cannot salvage and retro-fit to the Great Wheel) of new content that comes out - unless it is very generic and not dependent on the new cosmology.</p>

<p>I have to take this back all the way to my original premise back before this thread got so <span style="font-style:italic">tangenty</span> (is that a word?)</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>VikingLegion</em> wrote:</div>
Personally I believe there was a roughly decade-long period in the 80's and 90's that gave us an unprecedented burst of creative genius that will likely never be exceeded (or even matched for that matter). These are the settings I will always most closely associate with D&amp;D, or any fantasy gaming.... Planescape, Ravenloft, Darksun...
</div></p>

<p>So, I guess I was just trying to start up an innocent little nostalgia thread.  I've been out of the game for a couple years now and just recently have made an effort to refamiliarize myself with what is going on - and couldn't help but loathe the direction the game has taken.  So maybe I'm just an obstinate old geezer that believes <span style="font-style:italic">things were just plain better back in my day!!</span>  but even when I try to view it with a critical and unbiased eye, I can't see anything that refutes my original premise that these settings/periods were a Golden Age and nothing produced since can hold a candle to.</p>

<p>If I'm coming off as some grumpy old curmudgeon that is unable or unwilling to evolve and adapt to the times, just pat me on my head and let me have this final lament for what I consider the best content this hobby/genre will ever generate.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Yes, as I mentioned in my last post, and detailed why it was so easy in 3x Forgotten Realms.</p>

<p>BTW, just FYI, I have yet to encounter anyone on the Gamefaqs Pencil &amp; Paper RPG boards (the only other D&amp;D board I hang out at) who actually LIKES the fluff of 4E, and they all admit that they think it's far worse than that in previous editions of D&amp;D and AD&amp;D (which they didn't like either, but they state the fluff in 4E feels insulting, particularly the backstory to how the Far Realm gate got opened.  Something about it making Pelor and the gods look like complete dumbasses.)<br />
The only thing anyone seems to like thus far is the Raven Queen.  This is from a group BTW that thinks that 4E is the best thing since sliced bread saved Gurps 4.0 which they think is exponentially better, and that Gary Gygax and most of the 1E-3E staff were "grognards".</p>

<p>Oh, and remember me telling you guys how worried 4E fans are about the Essentials line?<br />
Well, according to them, one of the other reasons they're worried is because supposedly, Wizards has recently fired most (as in almost the entirety of the original 4E design team and staff.  I have no idea what Wizards is thinking by doing that...  If the Essentials is any indicator of how they're going to do things in the future, then they're going to alienate most of the 4E fans, and will be surviving on little more than brand name (although from what I've seen, brand name is more than enough to keep churners of even the worst quality crap afloat and ahead of their rivals...)</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">40 some odd years of history and lore largely erased so lazy developers can get a clean slate.</span><br />
I'm not sure I'd chalk that up to laziness on the developers' side.  Even I have found it difficult to keep with the continuity when writing new stuff for the Inner Planes (and especially the myths and folklore of the elementals), and without Palomides' photographic memory, it would likely be impossible.  Thankfully, the vast majority of subjects I'm working on never got much spotlight at all in the last 40 years, so that makes my life a lot easier.  So, I can understand the frustration of developers, ESPECIALLY since it doesn't appear as though WotC has created any software or compilations of info by subject to aid these developers.  So, I'd place the blame almost squarely on the shoulders of Wizards not doing anything to alleviate the difficulty of maintaining continuity rather than blaming the developers for constantly complaining about it, and the removal of the Paraelemental + Quasielemental planes plus other fluff differences between 2-3x, and the differences in fluff between 1-2E do not help matters.  On top of all that, they have to be able to introduce an updated version + expansion or whatever of the fluff and mechanics, ALL THE WHILE keeping it in whatever page limit WotC has demanded of them (which was a primary complaint from the old vets like Ed Greenwood).  What I'm trying to say is that it would be very confusing for the developers, in addition to being a hassle.</p>

<p>I'm not sure you'd like the Great Wheel and Inner Planes in 4E anyway, because one of the complaints that Wizards took to heart from the fans is that the planes are too hostile via environment alone, and thus unavailable to low and mid-level characters.  So now, the wildernesses of the planes are all survivable for 1st level characters without magical items *vomits*.  A lot of things are supposedly easier in 4x.  For instance, I've read that it's nearly impossible to get killed by traps, now.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

I'm not sure I'd chalk that up to laziness on the developers' side.  Even I have found it difficult to keep with the continuity when writing new stuff for the Inner Planes (and especially the myths and folklore of the elementals), and without Palomides' photographic memory, it would likely be impossible.  Thankfully, the vast majority of subjects I'm working on never got much spotlight at all in the last 40 years, so that makes my life a lot easier.  So, I can understand the frustration of developers, ESPECIALLY since it doesn't appear as though WotC has created any software or compilations of info by subject to aid these developers.  So, I'd place the blame almost squarely on the shoulders of Wizards not doing anything to alleviate the difficulty of maintaining continuity rather than blaming the developers for constantly complaining about it, and the removal of the Paraelemental + Quasielemental planes plus other fluff differences between 2-3x, and the differences in fluff between 1-2E do not help matters.</div></p>

<p>Yes but as passionate as you or I (or the rest of this board) are on the subject, it is a hobby for us, not our livelyhood.  I expect better from those in charge of producing content.  They are the caretakers of a 40 year tradition and they dropped the ball.  I'm sure it's not easy to sift through that wealth of material to stay within canon, or maintain at least somwehat passable consistency, but this is what they get paid to do.  Perhaps my expectations are too high.</p>

<p>Some software and actual support from up high would be hugely beneficial as you mentioned.  But most likely not forthcoming, as WotC seems to be cutting costs and going with a minimalist approach.  It's a shame that art nearly always becomes compromised by finances, but such is life.  Actually, a cheaper alternative for WotC would be to simply hire RipVanWormer as a continuity expert - that guy is like the Terminator of D&amp;D History and Lore.</p>

I'm not sure you'd like the Great Wheel and Inner Planes in 4E anyway, because one of the complaints that Wizards took to heart from the fans is that the planes are too hostile via environment alone, and thus unavailable to low and mid-level characters.  So now, the wildernesses of the planes are all survivable for 1st level characters without magical items *vomits*.  A lot of things are supposedly easier in 4x.  For instance, I've read that it's nearly impossible to get killed by traps, now.</div></p>

         <p>I don't think the Raven Queen is anything near the best things there are of the 4e fluff, since she's obviously just a amalgamation of Wee Jas from Greyhawk with Morrigan of Celtic Mythology.</p>

<p>For many of the 4e cosmology changes, I think a lot of it might lie with Wyatt who was and I think still is responsible for the story development of the edition.  While he might have a lot of good advice for new DMs with his "keep it simple" philosophy for DMs with their own worlds, the problem was that this philosophy was applied to a lot of the core setting.  </p>

<p>Perhaps one of the annoying things is the whole setting that's not really a setting, with all that stuff about Nerath, Bael Turath and Arkhosia when they clearly have a setting but don't call it as such.  I think they should just make that a setting, and therefore put it and the cosmology and how things are on the same level as Eberron and Forgotten Realms.  Making them a valid way things are, but not one that's written in stone everywhere across all sourcebooks.</p>

<p>There were certainly some areas that the fluff that they came up with in 4e was where improvement was needed.  Such as many common non-planar monsters who never had much of a story before, or logical places that certain classes fit (such as psionics), which was something that wasn't well thought of before.</p>

<p>Though I think plenty of the complaints and feedback might lead to more new settings coming back, and certain class designs coming back (see the essentials for example).  After all Dark Sun did come back as just another setting, and ignored most of what happened in the Prism Pentad Series, which I felt ruined the setting.  Ravenloft is coming back in some form, though it might be very different from what it was if it's a standalone game with playable vampires and ghosts that could be used with the core D&amp;D the way Gamma World is becoming.  </p>

<p>And the thing with Planescape in the official 4e products, is that Sigil is mostly intact and is the way it was after Faction War.  It could come back as a setting, though it whether it's the Dark Sun approach, or the Gamma World approach is another matter.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Indeed.  The problem however, and a major reason for the complaint from DMs and players alike, is that MOST people only like to play low-level games, or mid-level at the highest.  This has been the case ever since 1E.  One of the reasons, apparently, is that a lot of people find the 9th level spells to be "too ridiculously overpowered" and think that the high-level classes are too overpowered as well.  Plus the higher your character's level, the more bookwork you have to keep track of.<br />
So most people, apparently, only play up to 5th or 9th level and then call it quits.  This leaves planar travel out of the question.  </p>

<p>As for WotC's Carebear treatment of 4E, are other areas where they put on the kid gloves, as well.  For instance, I'm told that permanent ability damage and permanent level loss no longer exists in 4th edition.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

A previous poster mentioned this was already happening in earlier editions with Forgotten Realms and Dragonlance departing from the official canonical cosmology.  True, but those were <span style="font-style:italic">easy</span> fixes compared to what is presented now.</div></p>

<p>Just to clear things up, I wasn't saying they departed from the official canonical cosmology.  I said that the creators of Dragonlance didn't want TSR to force DL into Planescape/Spelljammer/Ravenloft.  Dragonlance came before the whole meta-setting concept, and they did not want it included in the meta-settings.  And I have trouble seeing the distinction between the Planescape cosmology being forced onto Dragonlance against Weis' and Hickman's will, and the 4e cosmology being forced onto other existing settings.  I do admit that I <span style="text-decoration:underline">like</span> the Planescape cosmology better than either of those two, but my personal preference aside, they're almost the exact same situation.  And it's unfair for me to say Planescape/et al being forced onto Dragonlance was okay and the 4e thing wasn't just because I prefer Planescape.</p>

<p>Edit: Actually, I have to go even further than that, thinking on it.  In the 4e case, in at least two situations (Forgotten Realms and Eberron), the respective creators of the settings (Greenwood and Baker) were entirely okay with it, and have even worked with WotC on the settings in 4e.  As for Dark Sun, I haven't heard any complaints from Brown or Denning.  But then again, Brown seems to have dropped off the face of the earth since around 2000, and I don't think Denning's still in the industry either.  Planescape hasn't hit yet in 4e, but it's going to soon, and I haven't heard Zeb Cook say anything bad about that.  And I can only assume Baur and McComb are okay with it; the former from his 4e work in Open Design, and the latter because of that quote I pasted earlier.</p>

<p>So even though I don't care for 4e, I have to say that it actually seems <span style="text-decoration:underline">more</span> fair, that transition, then what TSR did to wipe clean and replace Dragonlance's cosmology.</p>

<p>Then again, 99% of comparisons between TSR and WotC include the phrase "that seems more fair than what TSR did".</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I've always thought the complaints about Krynn being "forced" into the Great Wheel cosmology were overstated and revisionist.</p>

<p>First, Krynn wasn't the sole brainchild of Weis and Hickman. Tracy Hickman was the project leader, but it was a group effort involving a number of people, including Hickman, Larry Elmore, Jeff Grubb (who created the Krynnish pantheon), and others. Jeff Grubb, of course, is the creator of the Spelljammer setting, which first prominently included Krynn as part of a greater AD&amp;D multiverse. I say "prominently," because there were numerous references before that that made it clear that Krynn was connected to the other AD&amp;D worlds and planes.</p>

<p>In 1984, before Tasslehoff Burrfoot appeared in a novel, he appeared in the story "A Stone's Throw Away" by Roger E. Moore, in which the kender met Demogorgon. Yeah, <span style="font-style:italic">that</span> Demogorgon. In 1987, the 1st edition <span style="font-style:italic">Manual of the Planes</span> (by Jeff Grubb) made reference to kender in Acheron and the fact that Tiamat was known as Takhisis to her followers on Krynn. And, remember, Jeff Grubb <span style="font-style:italic">created</span> Takhisis, inventing her name and adapting her from the original OD&amp;D Chromatic Dragon for his homebrew D&amp;D campaign. If anyone's going against the original authorial intent, it's Tracy Hickman talking about his personal preferences regarding something he didn't create.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Dragonlance Adventures</span> (1987), credited to Tracy Hickman and Margaret Weis, is the source for claims that Dragonlance "originally" had its own cosmology, but you'd look in vain through that book for proof of that. What the book has are realm names assigned to various deities: it says Paladine rules "the Dome of Creation," Chislev and Zivilyn dwell in "Zhan, the grandest of forests," Gilean lives in the Hidden Vale, and Morgion dwells in a Bronze Tower "on the far borders of the Abyss." What you won't find are indications that Zhan, the Hidden Vale, or the Dome of Creation are planes in their own right. The first book to really explain what these names meant was the Planescape boxed set, which used the same names and made them realms in the Great Wheel. So the Hidden Vale was placed in the Outlands, the Dome of Creation in Mount Celestia, Zhan in the Beastlands, and Morgion's tower was named the Fortress of Disease and placed in the Gray Waste. Not only did this not contradict anything (recognizing that "the Abyss" is a general term for the lower planes), but it was the only way they could be consistent with the totality of Dragonlance canon, including Spelljammer, "A Stone's Throw Away," subtle references to the Great Wheel in the Dragonlance Monstrous Compendium, etc.</p>

<p>Much later, in 3rd edition, a new cosmology was created for Krynn, turning the Dome of Creation, Hidden Vale, and Abyss into outer planes in their own right and Zhan into a realm within the Hidden Vale (though <span style="font-style:italic">Dragonlance Adventures</span> never implied Zhan was a lesser realm than Gilean's valley). Claims that this is really the <span style="font-style:italic">original</span> Dragonlance cosmology are distortions of the real history of the setting. Dragonlance was always part of the Great Wheel, depending on what sources you looked at, and nothing until that point had explicitly stated anything different. From my point of view, the 3e cosmos was the "forced" imposition to the setting. </p>

<p>The issue with Dark Sun is similar. The <span style="font-style:italic">Dragon Kings</span> hardcover was the first Dark Sun book to really deal with cosmology, and it used the same cosmology as the 1st edition <span style="font-style:italic">Manual of the Planes</span>, even using the same charts. Later on that was partially retconned, with Athas getting different paraelemental plane names. But I think <span style="font-style:italic">The Inner Planes</span>, which incorporates Athas into the standard elemental cosmology, is as much "true" Dark Sun as anything else.</p>

<p>Tangentially, the 4th edition version of Dark Sun is very true to the original setting, I thought, and proof that 4th edition isn't all about running roughshod over previous canon. 4e Dark Sun, Eberron, the 4e treatment of Sigil, and 4th edition <span style="font-style:italic">Tomb of Horrors</span> were all characterized by great fidelity to the original sources. There are a few pesky differences (Zadara is served by maruts instead of sword archons, there was kind of a half-hearted attempt at working tieflings into Athas as a minor, desert-dwelling race, there's a mention of the Raven Queen in <span style="font-style:italic">Tomb of Horrors</span>) but really, it's a substantial improvement over some of the 3rd edition retcons (their avoidance of modrons, elimination of the paraelemental planes, giving the Lady of Pain an alignment, the whole 3rd edition Realms cosmology retcon, the Dragonlance cosmology retcon, the Paizo attempt at fitting 3e psionic races into Dark Sun, and I could go on).</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Yeah, Dragonlance was never anyone's homebrew campaign. It was like Birthright, Dark Sun, Planescape, Spelljammer, and Ravenloft, created by staff at TSR. It used Jeff Grubb's homebrew gods, and contributions from Roger Moore, Douglas Niles, Larry Elmore, Michael Williams and others in the initial design phase. Margaret Weis didn't become involved until later, when they needed someone to help write novels. Not to diminish her contributions, but it wasn't originally her brainchild. </p>

<p>Incidentally, Greyhawk was never Dave Arneson's campaign. Dave Arneson's Blackmoor campaign was created before Greyhawk. When Gary Gygax began his Greyhawk campaign a year later, in a different city, he seems to have used the same continent map as Dave Arneson (the continent used by Gary Gygax's Castle &amp; Crusades Society for their wargaming campaigns), but the two campaign settings didn't overlap. Gary Gygax and Rob Kuntz did once bring their characters Mordenkainen and Robilar to play in Dave Arneson's campaign, but they didn't regularly game with him; most of Gygax's correspondence with Arneson seems to have been by mail and at conventions. An "Archbarony of Blackmoor" was included in the published World of Greyhawk Fantasy Setting as an homage to Dave Arneson's campaign, but it's a very different place than Dave Arneson's Kingdom of Blackmoor. It's an homage, not the same place.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

Also, from what I've seen so far, I do NOT like what they've done with the planar characters in 4E.  I mean, Aseroth of Soulfreeze used to be an archomental?  WTF?  That makes zero sense at all considering what we know from the Planescape books (that an Abyssal lord has to defeat the will of the Abyssal layer in order to rule it-- something that nobody short of either a Demon or a deity can do)  Not to mention the whole Elementals= Primordials BS.  Even stupider is that the Titans are also primordials, despite the fact that the elementals would have had their civilizations in full swing before the first flesh-based organism (mortal or not) was even born/created/what have you.  Which would have occured BEFORE the existence of the Titans, as they could have come into existence after the Illithids time-warped into the past with their slaves, and it was their slaves who created the first deities through their belief.<br />
Oh, and let's not forget how Ioun was retconned into the whole thing.  The books act like she's always been one of the primary 15-20 or so deities, even though she NEVER has been before 4E.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

If athas.org was really selling books they probably shouldn't have in the first place.  They were meant to be a fansite, not making money off the IP related to Dark Sun.</p>

<p>And I don't think the existence of the primordial stuff is stupid as it in some form across many culture's mythologies in the real world.  What's stupid about the primordials is they made it too one-sided in depicting them as all bad.</p>

<p>As for Ioun, well they've had Ioun stones ever since 1e, if they were going to make a new set of Core Gods for the edition, they might as well name one Ioun.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>4th edition's default setting has a single, small pantheon with a disproportionately great effect on the multiverse as a whole - essentially, they created half of it, sculpting the Astral Sea and half the mortal world. The primordials were responsible for the other half (and the Far Realm is considered alien to the multiverse created by the gods and primordials). This is very different from the hundreds of 2nd edition pantheons, whose influence over the multiverse is comparatively small. So yes, in the smaller 4e multiverse, a single goddess like Ioun can be a very big deal, while in the 2e assumption, even if she was a major goddess on one particular prime world, she could be mostly unnoticed in the multiverse at large. </p>

<p>The 3e state of things was weird, since they mostly tried to stick to the relatively small core pantheon early on (you'll note they carefully avoided even mentioning non-core gods in the 3e Manual of the Planes, or they turned them into proxies or powerful mortals), and then added more gods to it as time went on (nonhuman races got their own pantheons in the Races of... books, more gods were added in Complete Divine, Book of Vile Darkness, Book of Exalted Deeds, Lords of Madness, and so on, and some of the other pantheons that had formerly been kept out of the core cosmology were allowed to leak in with the Fiendish Codices). But even early on in 3.0, when they were trying to pretend that the Player's Handbook gods were the only gods there were, they didn't really take that situation to its logical conclusion as they have in fourth edition. </p>

<p>Anyway, there's at least a few more years before we see 4th edition Planescape (Ravenloft's next year), if we ever do. Considering how thoroughly integrated into core Sigil is now, I have my doubts they could pull it off. </p>

<p>Regardless, I'm so beyond being worried about that sort of thing anymore. I've had years to adjust to the new regime, and I have.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><span style="font-style:italic">And I don't think the existence of the primordial stuff is stupid as it in some form across many culture's mythologies in the real world.</span><br />
That's not the part that I think is stupid.  The stupid part is that the elemental gods get lumped into the same group as the Titans et al. when the latter came into existence far later than the former.<br />
And yes, making them all evil is dumb considering that the four Elemental Lords and elementals are supposed to be neutral, as well as the existence of the Princes of Elemental Good. </p>

<p>Oh, yeah, another dumb thing about Aseroth being a former archomental: So we're expected to believe that there were once TWO Princes of Elemental Evil Cold?  Yeah, right.  Especially considering what we know from Dragon 354 (that the princes of elemental good were spawned spontaneously from their home plane to counteract the evil princes.  Presumably, the Paraelemental Plane of Ice has never had a need for a prince of elemental good cold because Cryonax has always had his hands full with rivals.)  Of course, with 4E's retconned cosmology, they're probably just claiming that Cryonax and Aseroth ruled separate cold regions of the Elemental Chaos, but that still causes the exact same problem that we'd have in 1-3x (in that two evil princes of cold would likely tip the plane AND paraelemental cold towards evil, which would have serious ramifications on spell/power use.)<br />
Then again, it doesn't seem like these rules apply anymore, anyway.  After all, the 4E cosmology is tipped towards chaos, yet this doesn't seem to have any effect on lawful characters or their abilities.  </p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">As for Ioun, well they've had Ioun stones ever since 1e, if they were going to make a new set of Core Gods for the edition, they might as well name one Ioun.</span><br />
I disagree; they already explained away the origin of the Ioun Stones for the core/default setting in Dragon Magazine 174-- Crystalle cultivates them in the Gemfields/Ioun region of mineral (which could just as easily be made a region of Earth in the 3x cosmology)  Also, like I said, they retro-fitted her into the setting, which I find inexcusable.  At least with the Raven Queen (at least from what I've been told), they explain how she came into being between 3x and 4E.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">
