</div> <p>So, here's the thing. Over on giantitp, we decided to start a project on Celestia, to give the celestias, as a whole, a little bit more coverage, since, so far, it seems that only the fiends get anything.</p>

<p>I have, for now, started on Lunia. I've read what I could find about in Planes of Law, and I've read up on the Archons.</p>

<p>It's not much. So, my questions for people:<br />
Are there any other sources for fluff on Mt. Celestia, especially Lunia? Canon or not, I'd like a little more to work with.<br />
Especially, is there anything on the Fortress Eternal and Everlasting? I've only found the name, but I like that name a lot. Otherwise, I'll see what I can make from it.</p>       </div>

          Re: Lunia: More information?        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Unfortunately, I don't have my notes with me but here is what I remember about it (and my tweaks to it)</p>

<p>Mt. Celestia is inspired by a fusion of Dante's Purgatorio and Paradiso. In those epic poems, there are seven (more or less) layers to the mountain (Purgatorio) and seven spheres of heaven (Paridiso) <br />
The layers of the mountain were divided by the seven deadly (venial) sins: (excessive) pride, envy, wrath, sloth, greed, gluttony and sloth.<br />
The heavenly spheres are tied to the heavenly body (moon, Mercury, Venus, sun, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn) and some lesser failings (inconstancy, ambition, loving people or things in the material world too much) and some spheres of increasingly perfected goodness (wise teaching of the faith, warriors of the faith, just rulers and then monks)</p>

<p>I believe the Planescape canon defines Lunia as the layer of innocent goodness. It is the layer of almost childlike untested goodness. This is the layer for those whose devotion and faith haven't undergone a test or crisis. In that sense, it makes for a good first layer. </p>

<p>Personally, I tried to gear the tests to make it to advance upward around the Deadly Sins. So to go from the first to the second layer, I had petitioners (and occasionally PCs) required to do two things:<br />
1) make an active decision to begin the arduous journey upwards (and a lot of petitioners don't as life on Lunia is pretty sweet)<br />
and 2) inspired by a Planescape comic, I included tests of covetousness to material possessions. A PC would have to willingly put aside some (or all) of his cherished magic items, etc. to advance upward. <br />
If the traveler didn't, I allowed him to climb for as long as he wanted; but he would never really advance up the slope until he had passed these tests. </p>

<p>But I believe your question was what sites, etc. will one find on Lunia itself<br />
Well there is <br />
-The Silver Sea filled with holy water that ends up baptizing all arrivals to this plane (personally, I had all entry points to the plane either hovering over the water or on remote islands requiring one to cross the Sea (and inevitably get soaked) to reach the Mountain)<br />
-Personally, I placed the dwarven heaven INSIDE Mt. Celestia. I placed the entrance to this on Lunia. Then I had the dwarves go through their own series of tests of dwarven virtues to advance up through their path to heaven<br />
-Barachiel's Citadel of Stars: city of the ruling trumpet archon, Barachiel<br />
-Heart's Faith: a sea-side city that got trampled in the unscheduled Modron March. An exit (only?) portal exists offshore of this site<br />
-Arch of Light (I think): a silvery balcony that overlooks the waters (also mentioned in the GMM - although it was just a generic site <br />
-Nemmiron: gate-town to Arcadia that is a little higher up the slope<br />
-Soul's Desire: gate-town that leads to Bytopia<br />
-I believe there was a monastary and a phoenix nest on Lunia mentioned in Planes of Law set<br />
-Tales of the Outer Planes had an adventure where a slaad egg hatched on the shores of Lunia and the chaos was corrupting to the residents. You could have that site marked as an area with still lingering odd effects. I believe this adventure also mentioned a fortress on guard against intruders that had a weird spacial effect (I believe the interior was all on one floor but behaved on the outside like it was three stories - e.g. walking from one room to another across the hall, the window in the new room would look out from the third story instead of the first) I don't remember the name of this fortress though. </p>

<p>Here is a list of Lunia sites I found on the web but with no details:<br />
**Fortresses<br />
-Celestial Fortresses (probably Chinese)<br />
-The Fortress Eternal and Everlasting: located on a separate mountainous island.<br />
-The Tower of Flames<br />
-The Amber Gates<br />
**Cities<br />
Trader's Rest<br />
Haven<br />
The Realm of the Zoveri - Zoveri are the half-squid men that live in the Silver Sea</p>

<p>From an on-line source, the following were mentioned (no idea if canon)<br />
-Island with a kingdom of wise, holy rats<br />
-Realm of intelligent, good dinosaurs</p>

<p>I guess my recomendation for new sites would be for<br />
1) fotresses of celestials ready to defend against fiendish (or even chaotic) intruders <br />
2) sites that include subtle tests or hints to something greater that would motivate one to begin the upward climb. Ultimately, the celestials want the petitioners to reach the highest heavens but they more than that, they want the petioners to WANT to make the effort</p>

<p>One property of the plane that I found interesting, paths (particularly those going up the mountain) are easier to find and use if one acts virtuously</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>OK, I got my notes. I don't remember how much of this is canon, how much is stolen and how much is original. </p>

<p>--Lunia, the First Layer: This is the realm of innocence ruled by Barachiel, the patron of the defending trumpet archons.<br />
	<br />
--The Arch of Triumph: a balcony made of silvery stonework that juts out from a cliff over the Silver Sea<br />
--The Beacon, the Bastion of Hope: a small realm consisting of a lighthouse manned by a bright lantern archon. It must often be defended from evil forces that seek to destroy it (mostly demons) or control it (devils). It guides in souls arriving in the Silver Sea and it inspires climbers working their way up the mountain<br />
--Bridge of al-Sihal: in the sea of clouds is a majestic bridge that leads to the shores along the edge of Mount Celestia. Guarded by powerful angels, this bridge serves as a test of worth (leap of faith?) for anyone that wishes to enter the mountain.<br />
--Castle Mahlhevik: the wonders of Lunia offer much, even for a chaotic evil wizard committed to learning the paths of goodness. Calling in favors from various demigods and revealing his sincerity to highly placed archons, the wizard Mahlhevik built his castle on the shore of the Silver Sea in peace. While he's sincerely attempting to reform, he's got a long way to go, and he retains many instincts and notions of his former lifestyle. Mahlhevik welcomes visitors and allows travelers of any alignment to stay in Castle Mahlhevik. Some of Mahlhevik's “old friends” such as Sytris, once called the Soul Reaver, and Japheth, formerly known as Lifeleech, visit from time to time. Arriving onto the plane waist deep in the holy water of the Silver Sea has a way of scarring and frightening away Mahlhevik's old friends, so they don't visit often. Interesting trades and even more interesting stories can be had at Mahlhevik's castle, and travelers who don't want to deal directly with archons regard it a good place to stay.<br />
--Citadel Orlerot: a structure on Mt. Celestia is three stories tall. But inside all the rooms are on the same level even if the arrangement won’t make sense. The views out of the windows are the correct height and angle (based on outside)<br />
--Field of Broken Avengers: the site where angels died fighting off a fiendish incursion<br />
--Font of the Fallen: supposedly changes the nature of those who were baptized in it. If a tiefling is baptized in the waters of the font, their fiend’s blood is cleansed; if a human is baptized in the font, they become partly angelic. It could even redeem demons to partial humanity.<br />
--The Glass Tarn: a lake of icy water is nestled in a bowl-shaped valley fed by the runoff from a glacier of blue ice high above. When a believer throws something truly important and valuable into the tarn as an offering, a light rushes up from the incomprehensible depths. When the light reaches the surface, it takes the form of a prophecy featuring the supplicant or a powerful archon to deal with the intruder if the offering was not sincere.<br />
--Heart’s Faith: the town nearest the gate to the Outlands. This town serves as the main trading post and welcoming center on the plane. It is ruled and policed by lammasu<br />
-Hermit’s Isle: this is the only point of land that can be reached without touching the Silver Sea. If one arrives in Mount Celestia via the Celestial Highway, one can descend the cloudy path to reach this small island. For those with evil intends, be warned that while one is not immediately immersed in the sea of holy water, there is no way to leave this small rock without touching the Sea or by leaving the way you came. <br />
	Teleportation does not work on Hermit’s Isle and those who attempt to fly or sail away from the island find that they are besieged by sudden violent gales or crashing waves that result in a person being fully immersed (as per a normal arrival on this plane)<br />
--Holier Than Thou: a city of perfectionists. They are stuck on Lunia since their sense of superiority is a form of egotism that must be removed to advance (not that they realize this)<br />
--The Silver Sea: upon entering the plane, travelers arrive falling in the holy sea of Lunia. Their swim to shore is the first test of diligence, a fundamental virtue of Celestia. The traveler makes a single Athletics check to represent the entire swim against DC 15 at heroic tier, 20 at paragon, and 25 at epic (the plane presents greater challenges to those of greater power). Failure summons a zoveri (aquatic being) to aid the traveler ashore, though if he’s trained in Athletics he suffers a -1 penalty to Diplomacy checks with the natives for his entire stay in Celestia. The holy waters are damaging to evil beings.<br />
--Outpost on the shore that serves as a welcoming station to some and as a defensive military outpost to other intruders</p>

<p>And for a site/adventure idea that is undoubtable lifted from somewhere<br />
--Mirror of Souls: Sometimes, the highest form of happiness can only be achieved by suffering. Insight comes at a price, as the darkness in a man’s heart can be difficult to face. There is a place in Celstia, where the confrontation is, arguably, made easier. For is it not easier to face a physical foe, than one in your own mind? <br />
A young prime elf approaches the PCs, looking very worried indeed. "Please, travelers. My friend and I were seeking the legendary Mirror of Souls when my friend fell down this pit. He couldn't climb up and we had no rope so he decided to find another way out. He explains that the Mirror of Souls is a legendary place which is said to aid those who seek to face the darkness of their own souls. His friend, a young human paladin-to-be named William had begged him to join him on a quest of atonement. They sought to find the mirror so that William could face the part that was hindering him on his way to paladinhood. <br />
In fact, they have already found the mirror of souls: It is the pit William fell into. Later they will find out why paladins aren´t really the ones that should be seeking this place, especially young and inexperienced ones like William. <br />
Any PC worth his salt should be able to find a way down without getting hurt. Even if they decide to jump, the fall is only 30 feet but very steep. Down in the pit they will find a network of tunnels, linking together seven caves (map up to the DM, of course). Within these caves the PC´s will face seven challenges, or as many as it takes for them to find William and return to the surface. Finishing the seven challenges will magically transport them to the surface. <br />
The challenges are as follows: pride, envy, gluttony, lust, anger, covetousness and sloth. Each is represented as a manifested spirit, and will each need to be defeated. William is a prisoner of anger, so if the PC´s don't reach anger last, they can simply climb out with William. However, others have failed these tests and there is treasure to be had in each of the caves (cheese for the bait really, the PC´s ought to explore without further prompting). Not all of the sins need to be fought, most of them are best defeated by wits. Actually, only gluttony has to be fought. <br />
Gluttony manifests itself as a huge, fat giant, which belches poison gas (stinking cloud at low level, Cloudkill or worse at higher). It will attack and attempt to eat one of the PC´s at a time. It won´t defend itself while eating, for it cares only for eating. <br />
Pride is a crowd of people, cheering and waving at the PC´s. ‘Persons´ from the crowd will attach themselves to individual characters and praise them constantly for the thing they are most proud. Pride can´t be fought, the only escape is humility. Truly attributing their accomplishments to others, luck or the fates is humility. For each boast the PC´s make, one act of humility needs to be done. If the PC´s get carried away they will be prides prisoners. Have someone rescue them in a few weeks. <br />
Envy is a room full of treasure. Amongst the treasure, a single powerful magical item rests (ring of regeneration or another item everybody can use and everybody wants). This item is quite real but the rest of the treasure is an illusion. There are two ways out: Deciding to leave the item behind, or, agreeing on one owner, unconditionally. <br />
Lust can be fought, but it is a nasty way out. It manifests itself as members of the opposite sex, one for each character. Each of them is a paragon of beauty for their species, each of them make stunningly literal attempts of seduction. Leaving this cave requires either killing all of them (ugh) or simply resisting their charm (save vs. spell). For every hint of enjoyment of the treatment the PC´s give, the save is at a cumulative –2 penalty and lust gains 2 hit dice (originally, each has as many hit die as the players). <br />
Covetousness may have to be fought. It manifests itself as a group of dwarves that demand a price from the PC´s (a large sum of treasure or some specific magic items). If the PC´s do not comply, the dwarves attack. Make it a tough battle. However, if the PC´s DO comply, they have truly conquered covetousness and should earn a XP bonus. <br />
Sloth is a nasty one. Fortunately, since the characters are adventurers, they are hardly susceptible to its lure. Its manifestation is a place of extreme comfort. It has everything the PC´s could ever dream of (use your imagination). It´s all an illusion. If the PC´s try out the comforts, only a save vs. spell will get them out (with a 1-4 penalty, according to the magnitude of the laziness). <br />
Anger will also probably need to be fought. Here young William is held prisoner by his own anger. If the PC´s manage to defeat theirs, they can the rescue unconscious sod and drag him out. The cavern seems to be full of mephits of every kind. They cover the walls of the cavern, shouting (surprisingly accurate) insults at the PC´s. In the center of the cave, anger manifests itself as the greatest enemy (living or dead) of the PC´s. For every insult that gets to the characters, anger becomes more powerful. Attacking anger in a berserk rage should be nearly impossible. Anger will attack the characters if they do not attack it, but if they have recognized it as anger (by name that is) and tell it to leave them, it will. <br />
As soon as anger is gone, the PC´s and William are magically transported to the surface, where Hlamdir is waiting. Saving William is definitely a good deed, so the PC´s should reach wherever they are going in only half an hour (an attribute of the travelers’ way).</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I'm pretty sure the Bridge of al-Sihal is the gateway to Chronias -- that is, it stands at the top of Mt. Celestia, on Jovar, not near the bottom on Lunia!  Also, the traveler's way is an attribute of Elysium, not Mt. Celestia.</p>

<p>By the way, Eldan, here's another bit from a different source: <span style="font-style:italic">Spell Compendium</span> (I don't know the original source) has three spells, <span style="font-style:italic">light of Lunia</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">light of Mercuria</span>, and <span style="font-style:italic">light of Venya</span>, that cause the user to glow and give the ability to fire off bolts of positive energy that do damage, more to undead/demons, and in the case of Venya possibly healing living beings.  <span style="font-style:italic">Light of Lunia</span>, unlike the other two, is a spell in the Mt. Celestia planar domain.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>You're right about the Bridge not being in Lunia. Not completely certain how that got misplaced in my notes<br />
It was probably due to my toying with a planar pathway across the Upper planes that involved clouds and mists (as I felt the use of a river should be unique to the Styx) I probably copied the Bridge with the intention of modifying it and never finished.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Lunia is an infinite silvery sea, bathed in eternal starry night and studded with islands. Many of these islands have mountains on them. These mountains generally stretch up and up until they vanish in a haze of light and glory; if you climb them, you end up on the next layer, Mercuria.</p>

<p>Of the many islands of the Silver Sea, only a few have received any detail. The one most people think of, which most people seem to refer to as simply Celestia or Mount Celestia, contains three known cities: Heart's Faith (which contains a portal to the Outlands), Nemmiron (which has a portal to Arcadia in it), and Soul's Desire (which has a portal to Bytopia).</p>

<p>Another named island is the Fortress Eternal and Everlasting. It's a separate landmass, mountainous, with a mighty fortress that seems to crown the mountain peak here.</p>

<p>There's not much official detail on Nemmiron, Soul's Desire, or the Fortress Eternal, but this is what I've come up with.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Nemmiron</span>, the gate-town to Arcadia, has an emphasis on harmony and conformity, with a strong Hardhead presence. Nemmiron sounds kind of Babylonian to me, so maybe it was founded by immigrants from Marduk who left Arcadia for some reason. Maybe they disliked the anti-dragon bias of Marduk when a member of their family mated with a silver dragon, so they're a clan of half-dragons with a Babylonian culture. The half-dragons founded and continue to rule the town, but the Hardheads badly want to make Nemmiron their beachhead into the plane, if they don't actually manage to make it slide into Arcadia. The half-dragons very badly <span style="font-style:italic">don't</span> want their town ending up near Marduk again, so they oppose the Hardheads as best as they can, without upsetting the archons by being unlawful or ungood. They're basically a theocracy ruled by priests of Bahamut, and perhaps Bahamut's palace occasionally manifests itself here. Possible ways to oppose the Hardheads include banning the color red, constantly changing the laws and prescribed holy days to make them difficult for outsiders to keep track of,  and limiting the size of public gatherings.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Soul's Desire</span> is more Bytopian, with an emphasis on trade and hard work. Its emphasis is on satisfying the hidden desires of the soul, with spiritual arts that no one else knows. For the past 500 years it's been ruled in secret by a cabal of celestial mind flayers who have learned to feed harmlessly on spiritual auras instead of brains, digesting the passions and lusts of those they meet and replacing them with a sense of serene satisfaction. They trade with the zoveri and sea elves for pearls they use as psionic focuses. </p>

<p>The <span style="font-weight:bold">Fortress Eternal and Everlasting</span> seems to have a theme of permanence, like something that was created at the beginning of time and believes it will stand until time's end, perhaps specifically created as a bulwark against the chaos found Outside of time. Its inhabitants are living constructs, confident in their immortality, continually repairing themselves with celestial alloys. They permit other races to dwell under their enlightened rule. Immediately below the reigning constructs are a caste of half-golems who have replaced some of their body parts with construct grafts, and below them are ordinary humans, aasimar, and dwarves who can't yet afford to become half-golems. </p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Player's Guide to Faerun</span> mentions three other mountains surrounding Celestia, which I assume are on separate islands though the book doesn't imply this. The gods placed there in that book weren't all placed there in Planescape's <span style="font-style:italic">On Hallowed Ground</span>, but I think it's better to go with the Realms-specific material in this instance for the sake of maximum compatibility. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Everwatch</span> is a guard tower in which the deity Helm dwells. Planescape placed this in Mechanus, but supposedly this tower moves around Celestia, appearing near any portal that opens there, including color pools from the Astral. Perhaps it moves to Mechanus, too .</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Martyrdomain</span> was Ilmater's realm in Bytopia. <span style="font-style:italic">Player's Guide to Faerun</span> placed the domain of Martyrdom on the same plane as Celestia instead. It's a place of comfort and rest, where it's impossible to feel weariness or pain.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Trueheart</span> is Torm's realm, resembling a fortress with walls of mithral, battlements of diamond, and gates of adamantine. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">The Court</span> is Tyr's realm. He also can be found in the hall of Valhalla on Ysgard, but this is his personal realm. He has built what seems like a titanic court of law crowning the mountain. Lies and deception are impossible there.</p>

<p>Siamorphe's realm, the Alabaster Palace, is supposed to be in an island between Celestia and the Court. I'd put it on yet another island.</p>

<p>The <span style="font-weight:bold">Eight Happinesses</span>, the realm of the <a href="encyclopedia/shichifukujin_.html" class="bb-url">Shichifukujin</a>, is also on Lunia, as is Nectar of Life, the realm of Brihaspati.</p>

<p>If you're asking yourself how big these islands are, you're asking the wrong questions. Both are functionally as big as they need to be. They'll take many days to circumnavigate completely. The time spent traveling is not spent transversing physical distance, but conceptual distance.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>The following was written by "Heregul" (Dave King), ages ago. His website is long gone, so I'm going to quote from it in its entirety. </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div><span style="font-weight:bold">Lunia</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">By Starlight</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Themes: Isolation, Love, Hope</span><br />
By the light of a thousand stars, travelers that first reach the Holy Mount are introduced to the stillness and quiet of Lunia. Lunia is the first layer of the Holy Mountain that is Mount Celestia, home of the archons and the dead spirits of the most righteous of paladins. There is no sun; Lunia is draped in perpetual twilight, with neither sun or moon above to light the beings that tread on its silver ground. This is a land of sleep, rest, healing, and love; the most pure of all actions mundane. One does not need to be a hero to find their final destination to be Lunia; one only needs to be a good, law-abiding being, someone who has followed the tenets of lawful goodness all their life. They never needed to take up sword and shield. Common among the petitioners here are librarians, doctors, good samaritans, unassuming beings that never strove for the stars. They are rewarded (or punished?) by existing in a world of twilight, without either positive sun or negative moon to reinforce their actions. They had the opportunity to be the mayors, researchers, saints of their respective communities, but they never shot high enough. They are now cursed to be the gatekeepers of Mount Celestia, helping those that travel through, those that have the ability reach higher levels of the Holy Mount. They have no such ability; they are tied down to their lives, their communities, their sense of duty, their desire to let the entire situation blow over. They're good people, but they've all lost any sense of hope: there's nothing to strive for anymore. Far from being the mindless automatons of the Grey Waste, they're as good souls as you'd find anywhere else, but seek to involve them in anything that has a chance to alter their own destiny for better or worse, and they'll shrink. They fear change in death as they feared it in life, and so make their own minor actions, hoping to ultimately steer themselves towards the glory that they feel they are capable of. They are respectful to everyone, for anyone could be an archon in disguise, judging them silently with their golden eyes.</p>

<p>Of course, the archons of this layer are probably the only thing that protects the petitioners from any events that could possibly harm them. It is the archons that deal with the fiends that attempt to storm the Holy Mount, deal with the Clueless that would seek to confuse the natives' malleable souls with their thousands of questions, deal with the cocky planars so sure that they're destined for the Eternal Light at the top of the Mount. The leader of the archons in Heart's Faith is Xek (Paramortal/Sword Archon/LG), a being that walks as one with the twilight. He commands a sizeable group of archons that deals with anything out of the ordinary in Lunia. A body traveling Heart's Faith had best be careful to not make themselves anything out of the ordinary. It's likely that most archons on the layer have some sort of tie to Xek, so it's best to extend the prior warning to the rest of the layer (and beyond, it's just good advice anywhere you go, really).</p>

<p>Heart's Faith is the town that most people climb out of the Silver Sea and enter. As a result, it's more of a traveler's town than one really indicative of the petitioner villages that exist elsewhere throughout the layer. Healers are common here, and the entire town is watched over by strange winged lion beings called "lamasu". They are rare to show their face, but the leader offers advice and wisdom on a daily basis to those that seek an audience with him.</p>

<p>The Silver Sea is described by visitors as one of the most serene places in the multiverse, at the right moments. The sea is comprised of holy water, water that makes entrance to the Holy Mount one of continual, forced baptism: a body doesn't have a choice whether or not to be blessed in the Celestian fashion. This same feeling is pervasive throughout the plane; Mount Celestia is its own being: a machine, changing the meek into heroes, changing the shy into saints, and bringing the wicked and foolish to its knees. The petitioners of Lunia know this better than most; they have been trapped at the foothills, outside the machine that might have made them something better than they were in life. Fiends that enter Mount Celestia find not a blessing but a curse, a silver sword crushing down on them, preventing fliers from flying - their only chance of life the Zovari, who tend to be helpful to most everyone. The Silver Sea is said to have an almost intoxicating affect on paladins, clerics of the gods of order, and such: the waters are said to smell sweeter than anything else in the multiverse, for it marks the promise of unity with the ideals that they strive to protect. Peering into the waters is a revelation for most; the Silver Sea is a mirror, shining back the true face of the body who peers into it, showing him what he truly is. Most people know this. For those that have taken a bath in the blood water of the Styx, the Silver Sea of Lunia symbolises a recentering of themselves, a rebirth into a life that they once had lived. No memories are returned: only the sense of oneself, and for a body that can't really remember much, that's something like a miracle in itself.</p>

<p>The stars above Lunia are said to be different for each body that looks up at them: the constellations contained within are indicative of the spirits that rule those that gaze up at them. Petitioners of Lunia claim that the most powerful constellations above are those forming a swan, a sword, and a mouse. Others exist (and are largely individual), but those three seem the most common and most prominent in the gaze of the petitioners. The swan, a symbol of the beauty that they wish they could become; the sword, a symbol of the justice that they wish they could be reinforcing; the mouse, a symbol of what they truly are. The petitioners of Lunia, meek and mild-mannered, expect no promotions, hope for no promotions. Their subconscious urge them forward, onward, away from obscurity, into the world of risk - but that is a small voice, one that only gets marginally stronger as the centuries drift away like comets across the skies of Lunia.</p>

<p>A few petitioners have gathered strength and left Lunia, ascended onward to the higher levels of the Mount. Jordon the Blind (Petitioner/Human/LG) is probably the most uplifting of the tales of those that have left the lands of twilight: after many centuries of obscurity as a small pharmacist, a wounded sword archon found his way into Jordon's apothecary in the middle of the Forest of Sound. She had battled and destroyed a swarm of wounded vrock that had made its way out of the Silver Sea, but became deathly wounded in the process. Jordon, then a sighted being, managed to nurse the sword archon back to health. Her name was Biinya (Paramortal/Sword Archon/LG), and in time, as she recovered, they fell into the most platonic of affections. She saw within him a good soul, one that was tied down by the quiet world that he lived in. One day, she became fully healed, and made ready to go. Though she loved him, there was nothing that she could do: he was too much a slave to his previous mortal existence. After she was gone, he realised that he had lost her forever, but did something very uncharacteristic of him. She was gone, for the sixth layer of the Mount, to report to her leader her status. He would never make it off Lunia, he believed. That was sixty years ago; today, he still seeks her, climbing ever higher towards the summit of the Holy Mount. The light of the mountain has made him blind, so unused to the light was he, but he seeks her still, somewhere around the fifth layer of Celestia. Someday he will find her, and the two will be reunited. He is sure of it.</p>

<p>The Forest of Sound, where Jordon the Blind hails from, is one of the more interesting places on Lunia (itself often very a drab world that hangs equally between darkness and light). Within it, the trees are made of only silver, and when the wind blows, a silvery chime can be heard rustling through the metallic sounds of the forest. Lantern archons are the only archons that enter it; those glowing seekers find peace in the solitude and the sound that the forest generates. In the wind, it is said that the Forest of Sound's tinny tune is a whispering voice, speaking to those that have the ears to hear it of a time long ago, when the Forest was constructed by the Archons in an attempt to emulate the natural life of the more chaotic side of the Great Ring. Their trees and plants were transformed from the swords of their warriors by magic, and as time wore on, the trees and plants slowly regressed into their base material - steel. Now, the forest is a land of quiet contemplation, where petitioners go to hear the stories of the wind, to learn from the past, in an attempt to affect their present and future.</p>

<p>The lantern archons are everpresent on Lunia. Wherever a body goes, it's likely that there isn't a lantern archon far. They are the newest of the archons (really not even archons, if a body is being technical), but they represent the souls who, in life, actively sought the creation of goodness and social order. The petitioners of Mount Celestia see the lanterns as lucky, when the reality is that every lantern is watched extremely closely by their respective hound archon to which they are assigned through a mental link. The purpose of being a lantern is to observe life on the Holy Mount enough so that they truly begin to understand the true tenets of law and good. Even for the most shining of the stars on the Prime, this process usually takes centuries. After a certain amount of time, lanterns sometimes give this quest up in their heart of hearts, and end up detached from their hound. They do not become asuras (only archon of hound or higher status are cast out as such), instead finding their lights dimmed and the fire within them nearly burned out. They have slipped through the cracks, unable to catch up with those around them, unable to move fast enough to advance within the machine. The most despondent of these archons become but silver stones on the shores of the Silver Sea. When a body climbs up those rocks onto dry land, they should be aware that they are stepping over all those that tried and have failed to attune themselves to the Holy Mount. The archons know this, know it as they travel the Plane, that if they are unsuccessful, this is their end.</p>

<p>Lunia is a place that symbolises both the beginning of journeys and the end of journeys. It is a place at the foot of the highest mountain in the multiverse, a place where nearly anything can happen. Underneath its stars, people are born, die, enter the mountain, leave them, swim in the Silver Sea - where a body can swim all day and never get wet, and find their true selves. Lunia is a land of self-discovery, a land of tests, where a body first begins to really understand whether or not he can really cut it on the Holy Mount. For some, there is success. For others, regrettably it probably is best that Lunia is as far as they got. The fabric of law and order can have no faults, no imperfections.</p>

<p>After all, this is Mount Celestia.</div></p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div><span style="font-weight:bold">The Sea of Regrets</span></p>

<p>Perhaps fallout from the attitude that the light aasimon Lyina's decision to channel the collected fears and doubts of the populace of Sigil into the sea of Lunia, perhaps the final result of the millions of dark souls that would have attempted to corrupt that holy sea for their own ends, but certain waters of the first layer of Mount Celestia have been looking rather shadowy lately. About a mile out from Heart's Faith, the Silver Sea seems to have taken on a hue more akin to nickel than the sheen that gives it its name, and even darker spots abound there. The zoveri, guardians of those waters, stay away from the mass, maybe half a mile wide and still growing.</p>

<p>Lantern archons that get too close to that spot in the sea usually don't end up seeing again, their potential sucked into the water, drained by the fears and regret that seem to permeate the area. Sometimes they manage to pull themselves back to the mainland, their glow a mere shadow of what it was previously, blinking about the pains and terror that they've suffered. The shadowy sea hasn't yet grown to the point where the Celestian High-ups feel a need to do anything about it yet (after all, most hardships are another test in their eyes), but should they actually get confirmation as to the fact that whatever is out there is derivative of some of evil, a body could be sure that the seas would be purged.</p>

<p>As it stands now, the areas of the sea that have become refuge for an unusual group of people. The twisted asuras Eysen (Pl/male asuras/Athar), Archaeologist and Explorer, has made his was to the polluted spot of Lunian sea, hoping to find something, some artifact, some relic, that can prove his former power fallible - and thus destroy her. It's also said that a twisted zoveri outcast has made his way to the depths, where even now he hopes to raise the waters of the Silver Sea above Lunia, causing his former tribe to ascend all at once - while drowning Heart's Faith. See, he was expelled from his former zoveri tribe for claiming that his people had things off poorly: they could not leave the Silver Sea and thus were unable to see Mount Celestia, and purify themselves. Uncontent to wait for the Coming of The Corquen (the day that the zoveri believe will herald a new dawn of their race and allowing them ascension), they sit amongst the corrupt waves, making freedom their own way, hoping to earn ascension through their own paths.</div></p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Hospital of the Plane-Scarred</p>

<p>The planes tell a million tales. Some are more happy than others, but on the Outer Planes, Upper or Lower, there doesn't seem to be something like a final happy ending in sight. The Lower Planes corrupt and destroy their inhabitants - at least they usually get right down to the point - but the Upper Planes are far more insidious; they show a body all the wonders of paradise, all the things that any berk could dream for, and dangles these things right under the noses of their visitors. They show them their final reward. They show them the places that their souls will live on, in peace and happiness. If a body has already seen the Promised Land, what else does he have to do in the Planes?</p>

<p>Mortals are Primes, at heart - whether or not their immediate ancestors were "planar" or not. The Outer Planes weren't meant to become what they were; ideology should have been seperated, the Upper Planes ending up as the ultimate reward for good souls, and the Lower Planes ending up as the ultimate punishment for the evil. Somewhere inside this grand plan, however, something went wrong: good and evil have become nearly indistinguishable on the planes, with the forces of law and chaos often providing the distinguishing point for the two ideologies. Mortals, never meant to see their paradise or punishment before the final day, now walk the planes, seeing things with mortal eyes. Those that manage to stay alive end up with a sheen of arrogance around them, the arrogance that any Prime would recognise as the unmistakable attitude of a planar. This attitude is, in effect, a defense mechanism. Should mortals actually ever truly realise what they were seeing, their weak psyches would end up burned to the ground, destroyed by the fires of the truth. This happens often: some of these broken people end up dead, burned out by the fires of their mind, unable to comprehend what they've just seen. The lucky ones either break on Mount Celestia, or find their way there in time. The archons direct them to the Hospital of the Plane-Scarred, on Lunia, near the blessed forgetfulness of River Lethe.</p>

<p>On some mornings, a body walking through the foggy mist created by the Lethe might have a tendency to forget why they've come there in the first place; such is the air around the Hospital. Usually the layer's standard twilight is thick with fog, water coming off of the Lethe, obscuring the Hospital's brilliant red banners that seem to call to wanderers through the fog. As a body walks along the silvery roads to the Hospital, he is watched from the windows by countless lantern archons, looking to gaze upon the face of the sick, the wounded, the needy, and hoping one day to be like the warden archons that look over the patients. At the door, people are met by the archon Kybel, a wise elderly warden being that watches over the patients and ensures their forgetfulness.</p>

<p>Patients at the Hospital are treated by both mortal and archon alike, given intense emotional support so that they might someday be ready to rejoin something like society. Those that are rehabilitated are returned to the Prime; told by the Celestians to live a peaceful and quiet life before attempting to wander to their final destination. Some return to the Planes, searching for something that they can't describe, something intangible: lost loves, perhaps. The places of their birth. Their family. Sometimes they can functionally rejoin society in the Outer Planes, those that return to the Great Ring, that is. Most of them manage to live the rest of their lives in peace on the Prime, with little memories of their past, after imbibing enough Lethe water to make someone forget their own name. In the end, names don't matter. Compassion does.</div></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>He also wrote the following on zoveri:</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div><span style="font-weight:bold">The zoveri</span></p>

<p>"<span style="font-style:italic">We're actually a pretty sad people. If you think about it. I suppose. We try to put on a good face, but in the end, all we're really doing is waiting around. Our existence and purpose is that of helping other people, ensuring that other people can be subjected to the tests and the glories of Celestia. Us? We just sit around and fish you berks out of the drink. Sometimes the only thing that keeps me going is knowing that someday, I'll walk on land with the rest of you bipeds, and finally prove that I can take the tests of the Holy Mount, that glorious mountain that I can only imagine now."</span></p>

<p>Footnotes to Mount Celestia, dwelling in the silver seas of the twilight layer of Lunia, the zoveri are usually the first beings that travelers new to the Holy Mount encounter. They're there to help those that can't swim, the disoriented, and all those that have just arrived in the Silver Sea for the first time, as all portals to Mount Celestia invariably lead to the Silver Sea, the first test on which all the other trials of the Mount are based. The first test is a baptism of sorts: bathing the supplicants and pilgrims in consecrated water, immediately weeding out those meaning ill. The righteous cannot drown in the water, for the zoveri are there to save them; octupusesque from the waist down, but humanoid from the waist up, they are charged with ensuring that all with pure hearts are allowed to make it to Heart's Faith, the first step on the journeys of thousands into the heart of ordered goodness each day. The zoveri are kind and helpful, welcoming all sorts of travelers to Mount Celestia, helping them along their way. For most travelers, the zoveri that they see in the Silver Sea will be just another memory along the way, another bump along the road: zoveri are not known to be seen anywhere outside the Silver Sea of Lunia.</p>

<p>However, whereas the zoveri seem to put on a kind face, inwardly they burn. They have been made imperfect: perhaps once a sort of archon, they now seem a crude hybrid between octopus and mortal, whereas the archons are purely one form or another. They are to help thousands of beings a day, where few of them will actually reach the purity that they seek, but at least they are given a chance. The zoveri, water-bound to the Silver Seas of Lunia, do not have that chance. Most maintain a good face about it: zoveri prophecies and legends speak about the Coming of the Corquen, a being whose arrival will signify a new beginning for the zoveri people. Perhaps transcendance into actual archons? Perhaps a chance for transformation into beings that can survive outside of water, so that they might someday ascend?</p>

<p>Even the lowliest lemure has a chance to become a solar, given that they don't die completely in the Silver Sea, are slain by the inhabitants, or anything else. The zoveri are not even granted that dignity. It is said that one of the first asuras created was a sword archon that found itself unable to follow one of the confusing laws of the Holy Mount without contradicting another, a failure of interpretation on his part. Rather than attempt to teach him, the archon high-ups at the time saw him as flawed metal, casting him into a new shape - the shape of a molluscoid demon, a huge mass of tentacles with a thousand glowing red eyes, and then threw him into the Silver Sea in the hopes that the holy water would destroy him in his new form. After all, how would it look to have the archons directly shedding the blood of their own kind? However, the Silver Sea nurtured the abomination, forming its children out of the dead flesh that occassionally drifted from it. Its children, say these legends, became the zoveri. As the asuras's kind heart remained even in its monstrous new form, so were its children kind and willing to help, becoming experts in navigating the Silver Sea and helping those that entered the Holy Mount seeking guidance and experience. Over time, the location of the asuras-being has faded from all knowledge, but its children live on and propagate their breed, hoping one day that the crimes of their progenor will be forgiven, and they will be given the chance to ascend the Holy Mount like all others that they help. This is the Coming of the Corquen that they wait for: perhaps Corquen is the name of that bloated celestial being that sired their race so long ago, or perhaps Corquen is something greater: speaking of a time of forgiveness for all asuras cast down by the forces of Order. If that's the case, perhaps the zoveri will be waiting long indeed for the Time of Corquen.</p>

<p>Until that time, the zoveri are willing to help those that land in the Silver Sea, willing to ensure that no good soul drowns. It is said that the zoveri will be forced to pay off the sins of their father for another thousand years for each good soul that drowns in the waters of Lunia. As such, the zoveri must be good-natured and cheerful: the decks are stacked so far against them in their favor that the humour that they seem to demonstrate is a bleak sort. Given that they believe the entirety of Celestia currently hating them, they must do what they can to win back their trust. In reality, the archon leaders have forgotten about their progenor, and see the zoveri as kind beings - kind beings that they have no idea about their origination, seeing them instead as native creatures of the Mount like themselves.</p>

<p>None of this is to imply that the zoveri are anything less than kind guides: the majority of their burden gets shunted back into the less-conscious parts of their brains, keeping hope alive, knowing that if they perform well, they too might become personal servants of the powers and bring glory to the Holy Mount; at their point, probably they'd do anything to escape their current position. Rather than disobeying their prophecies, they will adhere to them, waiting for what has been promised by the Law of the Land.</div></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Personally, I don't like the zoveri being quite so lamentable. But your (retold) tale has inspired me. I think I will change them to be petitioners that are trapped in their forms because they are waiting on their savior, Corquen, to redeem them instead of taking responsibility to strive to redeem themselves.</p>

<p>Some other possible locations that could be created (or fleshed out) for Lunia:<br />
--Siamorphe's Alabaster Palace: Since she is the goddess of divinely sanctioned rulership, her palace might be a place with a Stone of Scone type tradition, where very special types of monarchs must be crowned to legitimize their reign. Or if a dynasty has become horribly corrupted and the new ruler wishes to purge the taint of his line, perhaps he needs to travel to this site and receive the blessing of the goddess and be crowned by her<br />
--A site famous for being a place where a paladin or cleric goes to atone for his sins<br />
--A site that (unknown to the applicant), is a place where a haughty, vain or stubborn paladin or cleric is sent if he needs to learn humility</p> <div class="dice_rolls">
