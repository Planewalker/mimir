          Rowen Darkwood, the Fated, alignment and objectivism        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
        <div class="dice_rolls">
</div> <p>This has bugged me ever since the latter half of the Planescape series, and especially after the events of Faction War.</p>

<p>How the heck did Rowen Darkwood keep a chaotic good alignment?</p>

<p>The guy basically tries to take over the universe and/or nearly destroys it in the process.  In addition to this, a large part of his plan involves taking advantage of and brainwash a mentally unstable person (Alishon Nilesia) who he then sells into slavery. This is just the end game of a longer scheme and a lot of other acts.</p>

<p>And all this time, he remains chaotic good?</p>

<p>Okay, so Rowen Darkwood turns out to be the overall villain of the piece.  (The "piece" here being the Planescape background/story.)  That's not what I have a problem with.  He turns out to be the main antagonist after seeming in the beginning to be a good guy.  Still, no problem,  it's a twist.  I like twists, I'm a writer myself.  Darkwood does a lot of morally questionable acts some of which he thinks are for the greater good, and he has a number of personal flaws.  Still no problem.  He's an interesting, complex, well-thought-out character.</p>

<p>But there is no way he is chaotic good, or even if at the start of the background he's chaotic good, there is no way he remains so.  Chaotic?  Sure, but good?  No way.</p>

<p>Now, a bit of a sidenote for full disclosure.  I am not an objectivist.  In fact, I disagree with just about every point of objectivism.  I say this because the Fated are basically a faction of Randian objectivists.  Now, I have nothing against this, part of the entire background of Planescape is about conflicts between philosophies, and having objectivists out there fighting it out against the others is logical (cuz it's a philosophy).</p>

<p>And, even though I don't agree with objectivism, I have no problem with the objectivist faction being listed as chaotic good.  There are a people who see it as such.</p>

<p>The problem I have with it is that Darkwood seems to be able to do ust about anythign he wants without endangering his alignment.  Now, granted, he's not doing anything he shouldn't as a Taker.  And, Takers don't have to be chaotic good (any alignment but lawful good) even though they are (along with the Sensates) one o the chaotic good factions.  I wouldn't even have a problem with them having a Factol of another alignment  (In fact, they seem like one of the factions more likely to have Factols with a wide range of alignment.)</p>

<p>But let's take it as a given for the sake of the argument that the Fated are (generally) a chaotic good faction.  I still don't think that Darkwood (especially by the end) is in any way chaotic good.  Chaotic, possibly, but  I think that by the time of the events of Faction war, he should be either neutral evil (my guess), possibly chaotic evil, or even lawful evil.</p>

<p>From the background, we know that Darkwood was good at one time.  However, I'm wondering when he would have lost his alignment, and if he was still chaotic good even when he became Factol.  (Or even when he arrived in the outer planes the second time).</p>

<p>We know that he caused a schism in the Ring Givers and made/remade the Fated in his own beliefs.  How he did so is hinted at to be either through debate with the previous factol (fine for any alignment) or through blackmail.  (probably not fine for someone of good alignment, especially since the person he would have been blackmailing was chaotic good.)</p>

<p>Under his leadership, the Fated have a tendency to use loopholes in the law or the letter of hte law to take possession of other people's property.  Let's give Rowen the benefit of the doubt here, and say that that was primarily the actions of neutral evil, lawful evil, and lawful neutral Fated, and that Darkwood was a rather hands-off Factol with such things.  It certainly shows that the Fated would have little to no problem as a faction with lawful evil behavior.  Fine, that's an allowed alignment for their faction.</p>

<p>Strangely, though, a lot of the other NPCs we know are doing this (in the Cage Guide to Sigil, Factols' Manifeseto, etc) are still listed as chaotic good.  This will be important a couple of paragraphs down, so keep it in mind.</p>

<p>Okay, by 3/4 of the way through the background, Darkwood is involved with Alishon Nilesia, the Factol of the Mercykillers, and the two factions become allies.  Okay, the personal level, I can see: Rowan is manipulative, and Alishon is nuts.  But an alliance between the Fated and the Mercykillers?  A chaotic good faction (supposedly) and a lawful evil one?  Does this make sense, especially in Planescape where everything is about power of belief/philosphy?  (remember, part of Arcadia gets sucked into Mechanus because they Harmonium violate their alignment just a bit and become too lawful neutral instead of lawful good.  Does it seem in a background like that that an alliance between factions of directly opposed alignments would be stable?</p>

<p>So what does Darkwood do now?  He tries to depose the Lady of Pain, take over Sigil (and, it's implied, by extension, the Multiverse) and almost destroys both in the process.  On a personal level, he sells Alishon into slavery (!) to the Baatezu.  Is this in any way a chaotic good act?!  Selling someone into slavery to a lawful evil race of Fiends?!  Additionally, Darkwood knows what she is in for, one of hte main parts of his backstory is that he was tortured by Fiends himself.</p>

<p>This has got to be an evil act.  A severe requires atonement to get your alignment back type evil act.  How, in any way, can it not be an evil act to convince somone you love them, and then sell them into slavery in Baator.</p>

<p>what I'm wondering is if it has anything to do with the philosophical beliefs of the creators of planescape.  Was it Zeb Cook or another writer basically doining the Randian hero thing, with Darkwood as basically an outer plane John Galt who can do anything he wants?</p>

<p>This is just my current theory, and I'm curious to see what other Planescape fans think  How the heck did Rowen Darkwood stay chaotic good?</p>

<p>Pentalarc</p>

<p>But to the end, he's listed as chaotic good.</p>       </div>

         <p>This ruffled some feathers for me too. While I don't know the history/motivations of the various Planescape writers; I had always assumed that, Darkwood fell into the category of characters that were designed for one purpose but then re-written as the needs of the campaign grew (e.g. Rary "the Traitor" in the Greyhawk campaign) rather than a statement on Objectivism.</p>

<p>Admittedly, I suspect that it was a case of sloppy editting by not updating Darkwood's alignment when his role in the cosmic drama expanded and I think a shift in alignment was definitely implied (even in early Planescape, he seemed more Neutral to me than CG). But not having worked with the actual authors, I can't definitely say what they intended</p>

<p>Earlier I had brought up some of my confusion regarding Darkwood's timeline and his alignment where I brought up the following idea<br />
<a href="forum/timeline-factol-darkwood_.html" title="/forum/timeline-factol-darkwood">/forum/timeline-factol-darkwood</a><br />
"I also realized that Darkwood illustrates the Unity of Rings and the Rule of Threes with regards to his alignment. <br />
He supposedly started off as "good" (although, I don't recall him ever REALLY acting that way), his behavior when initiating the Faction War is neutral (at best); and then when he gets thrown back into the distant past and becomes the uber-powerful wizard, he seems to have taken on a more evil aura."</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I don't think there was some hidden agenda on the part of the PS team to push an objectivist truth. IMO the Faction War was a poorly written adventure that ignored a lot of the themes of Planescape, as well as the works that came before. The alignment thing of Rowan Darkwood and the Fated-Mercykiller alliance are just a couple examples of why I never ran Faction War and why my new 4e PS game ignores it.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Eh, Pentalarc, whatever made you conclude that the Fated were Chaotic Good as a Faction? I don't see that listed anywhere. I always thought of them as basically Lawful Neutral tending towards Lawful Evil (since they frequently abused their authority in Sigil to extort extra tax money from people, used loopholes to forclose early on people's property, etc.) In addition, the Fated discouraged outright, no-bones-about-it theft (which, being unlawful, would be a Chaotic act) among its members. But you're right, Rowan should not have been listed as Chaotic Good once he began plotting to harm innocent people to acheive his ends, or when he decided to break Sigil's laws. Frankly, he was listed as Chaotic Good primarily because that's the alignment you have to be to quality for the Ranger class in 2nd Edition AD&amp;D!!! (Thus putting game-rules ahead of story...)</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I tend to view most factions (with a few obvious exceptions) as appealing to numerous alignments. <br />
Regarding the Fated, I always viewed them as a quasi-Libertarian group that promoted individual rights to do as they pleased (even if some members went about it by exploiting the existing laws to get there). I definitely see this appealing to chaotic and neutral types.</p>

<p>More strongly, I disagree with your implication that theiving = chaotic. First, I know of many technically legal acts that result in theft in all but name (or as another example, a tyranically run theives guild). Secondly, believing that the will of an individual takes priority over the demands of the state (what I define as AD&amp;D "chaotic") certainly doesn't equate to a belief that theft is inherently something to be persued.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Palomides, what I meant is ILLEGAL theft, such as breaking and entering, mugging, etc. when I said that theft was a Chaotic act. That is, such acts are against the law, and therefore not Lawful. Obviously there are plenty of legal ways to take people's property wrongfully, but since such ways are by definition Lawful, they cannot be prosecuted as theft even though the victim considers it such. I was not trying to impune all Chaotic types as being prone to theivery. I was simply pointing out that the Fated don't approve of taking people's stuff via illegal means, but instead favor using the law to acquire other people's goods (for instance, by using loopholes or technicalities). The Fated believe that you must earn everything you acquire, and in their eyes using the law to get it counts as "earning" it whereas highway robbery does not. In defining the Faction as behaving in a Lawful Neutral/Lawful Evil manner, I was referring to the Faction's behavior as tax collectors in Sigil, not the actions of any individual member of the Fated, who might be any alignment. I apologise if I offended you - that was not my intent.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

I wasn't offended (but I do appreciate the civility on your part)</p>

<p>I guess (upon reflection) was that I was starting by viewing the Fated as Libertarians and then explaining their actions in that light. So I tried to take all of there actions as an attempt to increase their own liberties.<br />
As a parallel, a person who buys a radar detector (a legal act) so that he can circumvent the law and do what he wants. Personal liberties &gt; the law of the authorities equating to what I define as AD&amp;D's concept of "chaotic"</p>

<p>[By contrast, some other lawbreakers might be "lawful" (with the interests of the organization outweighing the individual) - for example, a tyranically ruled mafia]</p>

<p>But now that you make me reconsider, I could easily see interpreting the actions of the heads of the faction (especially their tax collection) as more on the lawful side of the equation.</p>

<p>But ultimately, I think it still boils down to different writers coming up with confusing and conflicting  interpretations of what they think the faction (and especially Darkwood) are all about</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Yes, plenty of criminal organisations are "Lawful" insomuch as they have a rigid hierarchy and strict rules. In fact, perhaps the alignment term "Lawful" might be better replaced by some other term such as "Orderly", since "Lawful" people and organisations usually only follow CERTAIN laws and not EVERY law (which would be impossible anyway, since some laws inevitably conflict with others). A Lawful Good Paladin certainly isn't going to follow a law that requires him to do something evil, for instance, unless he values Law more than Good (and then he would lose his Paladinship).</p> <div class="dice_rolls">
