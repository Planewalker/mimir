</div> <p>(Or maybe the name could change; I'm not certain that this name is the best choice for this faction.)</p>

<p>The Order of Knights Errant</p>

<p>"The Yugoloth in Black fled across the Outlands, and the Ronin followed..." (With apologies to Stephen King.)</p>

<p>The Order of Knights Errant is not so much a true faction, as it is a group of like minded folk set upon making the world a better place, one fight at a time. The fact that many of their members leave a long trail of dead bodies behind them is entirely beside the point.</p>

<p>Philosophy: Protect those who need protecting; defend those who need defending; defeat those who need defeating; kill those who need killing.<br />
Nicknames: The Wanderers; the Ronin; the Avengers.<br />
Headquarters: None; the closest thing the Order has to one is the Regulator's Guild in Sigil.<br />
Majority Races: Humans, Elves, Bariaur, Aasimar. (Could change.)<br />
Majority Classes: Dedicated Hero, Fast Hero; Gunslinger. (Could change)<br />
Faction Prestige Classes: Ronin; Wandering Wizard; Knight of the Gun.<br />
Factol: None<br />
Prominant Members: Lawrence Michaels (LG Male ???, Strong 3/Charismatic 4/Soldier 5/Knight of the Gun 2); Old Jenny (Female Elf CG, Smart 3/Mage 7/Wandering Wizard 3); Bill (CN Chaond, Dedicated 2/Smart 4/Fast 5/Ronin 2).<br />
Alignment: Any non-evil, with chaotic tendencies.<br />
Symbol: A sword, between a flower (usually a rose or a cherry blossom) and a gun (usually a pistol). (See The Badges for variations, and why they are notable.)</p>

<p>Philosophy:<br />
Fight the Good Fight. Four words, that mean everything to the Wanderers. They dedicate their lives to fighting the Good Fight, regardless of the cost to them personally (and, in some cases, regardless of the cost, period). Protection and defense of the righteous but weak is theoretically their primary concern, while punishing the wicked and/or preventing their plans from coming to fruition is secondary. Everything else is unimportant (and that includes the lives of its members).</p>

<p>Now, an important bit to realize is that when the Good Fight is finished (or at least, a member's part in it), that member should move on to find another Good Fight. Once their task is done, a Wanderer tends to vanish into the night, not asking for any reward but a job well done.</p>

<p>This is not to say that the Wanderers are universally grim killing machines; you're just as likely to find one helping out at a soup kitchen or working as an auditor in a company that's trying to clean up its act as you are to find one preparing for the defense of a town against tanar'ri bandits or searching for a weakness in the fortress of a particularly nasty 'loth.</p>

<p>Needless to say, they are widely considered to be a horrible anachronism by many "modern" groups. But, well, there's always folk who need protecting, and always folk whose schemes need stopping, and the Wanderers try to be there to help with both.</p>

<p>History:<br />
Once upon a time in the Outlands, shortly after the end of the Pantheon War, there was a minor Demigod (let's call him Palance) who had set up kip near Carceri. Palance had betrayed the Triumvirate early in the war, then betrayed the Alliance late in the war, and was indirectly responsible for several hundred billion deaths in various Primes. At the end of the War, though, he came to an agreement with the 'loths, and was well protected.</p>

<p>And then, one day, nine heroes decided that he could not be allowed to continue to live under an open sky, and agreed to slay him. Six of them were killed in the effort, but three saw Palance die by his own hand rather then face justice, and were left with the decision of what to do. The 'loths, and several Powers, wanted them dead; and they would find no respite in the Upper Plains, for Palance had cursed them to never see a Plane of Good with his dying breath.</p>

<p>And from their wanderings following this battle, the seeds of an order of Knights formed; one that survived the death of high magic, the predations of the Factions during Age of Pain, and the turbulence of the Revelationary Era by never staying in the same place for very long, never looking back, and never settling down.</p>

<p>Their current status of being on the edge of a fully fledged Faction owes to two people: Old Jenny, who first invented the magical badges (see below) that all members of the Order wear, giving them a unity they had never had previously; and Lawrence Michaels, who took the Order's only real fixed place of business, the Regulator's Guild, and made it into a true (if minor) political player in Sigil.</p>

<p>The Badges:<br />
These are the artifacts that transformed the Order of Knights Errant from a not widely known group that almost wasn't worthy of the title of Sect, and brought them firmly into notability across the planes. They do two things: first, they act as an infallible mark of the wearer's character, and second, they show a member who uses it where they are needed.</p>

<p>The Badges are made from the willingly surrendered bits of the flesh of an Eldarin, and are easily recognized as such; they show the Symbol of the faction, and show the status of the wearer, in very particular ways:</p>

<p>If the sword is missing from the symbol, the member is an apprentice.<br />
If the the gun is missing, the member is retired.<br />
If the flower is missing, the member is no longer following the ideals of the Order. (Those who show this version of the symbol tend to quickly lose their Badges, for several subtly obvious reasons.)<br />
A single symbol means the wearer is the equivalent of a Namer, or in some cases a close ally of a full member.<br />
The relative size and placement of the three sub symbols can tell you quite a bit about the history and personality of the wearer.<br />
If none of the symbols are seen, then the wearer is *not* a member of the Order.</p>

<p>The badges are easy to recognize (a DC 5 Knowledge (Factions) and DC 10 Spot roll will do), and are widely known to be nearly impossible to properly forge. (In game terms, you'd need to make at least 5 DC 30 rolls across several skills to create such a forgery, and a failure on any one of these rolls makes the falsehood obvious to close inspection; more then one and it's obvious even from a distance.)</p>

<p>The second special property of the badges is that if anybody (member or not) holds them in their hand (or equivalent) and rubs them, a sword will appear, pointing in the direction they are most needed (or a flower if they are needed where they are). Note that this: 1) Doesn't tell you about the situation that you are needed for, 2) Directs you to where you are needed, not necessarily where you need to be, and 3) Doesn't tell you how far it is if actual travel is involved, although, if while traveling you don't stop voluntarily, you are usually guaranteed to get there in time.</p>       </div>

         <p>Should I bother writing up the Regulator's Guild and the Movers and Shakers (and why there is no Factol) of this faction? (I'm not familar enough with D20 Modern to write up the Prestige classes.) Or should I just leave this to lie fallow?</p>

<p>TN, I think you're trying too hard to press your faction (or sect, as someone suggested it could be) on other members.  If they like the idea of your faction (which I personally think is too narrow in focus to be a faction), then they will include it.</p>

<p>I would recommend reading over the Revealing Light or WN's Order of Being.  Those are both solid faction ideas, and they may give you some ideas on what to include.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

          Suggested Faction: The Order of Knights Errant        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;Bob the Efreet&#039;</em> wrote:</div>I like the idea, but I'm not sure if it's a strong enough concept to be a faction. As a sect, or just a group of wandering knights, it fits very well, though.</div></p>

<p>I view them as on the border between a sect and a faction; depending on your definition of Faction, you could call them either, or even both. Here's a new section, since I'm posting anyway:</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Allies and Enemies:</span></p>

<p>For the most part, relations with other factions vary from slightly disdainful to slightly respectful, with no strong emotions; there are, however, two notable exceptions: The Hardheads view the Wanderers as dangerous and disruptive of harmony; and the Ciphers usually view them as slightly misguided, but on the right track, and worth aiding when the Cadence of the Planes allows (which is surprisingly frequently).</p>

<p>On the other hand, relations with Exemplars are much more... intense. The 'loths hate, hate, hate the Wanderers with a passion that surprises most observers, until they realize that the Order has interfered with their plans on a regular basis since slightly before it was formally formed. The tanar'ri loathe the Order, if not as much as the 'loths. The Baatezu view the Wanderers as anachronisms, but still occasionally dangerous. The Eldarin are very close allies to the Order. The Guardinals aid them sometimes, and frequently give advice. The Archons view is a mirror of the Baatezu: anachronisms, but still occasionally useful. Neutrality is the order of the day with the Slaad and the [whatever the LN exemplar are], if for different reasons.</p>

<p>Note that all of these Exemplar entanglements have less to do with alignment then with the fact that the Wanderers' battles bring them into alignment or conflict with these Exemplars on a regular basis.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

          Suggested Faction: The Order of Knights Errant        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Here's the rest of the write up. Should I revise this, add on a some meta-game material (how to use them as Villians, for example) or let it fall into the dust bin?</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">The Regulator's Guild:</span></p>

<p>Used to be, this was just a single person, the Guildmaster, usually found in the Minder's Guild, who offered slightly cheaper services for those in true need. The Sodkillers tolerated this competition because the Wanderers generally worked jobs that were considered fool's errands or too risky for the money offered, they never operated in Sigil, and (when somebody tried to object on philosophy grounds) because the Regulators only took jobs that veered towards justice of one sort or another.</p>

<p>The Guildmaster was in regular contact with members of the Order through various means, and recruited members for the purposes of the missions he, she, or it had arranged. The Guildmaster was usually a slightly risky job (although as much as you might think, because he was in theory a member of the Minder's Guild, and thus under the protection of the Sodkillers), and thus there was a regular turnover of Guildmasters throughout the history of the Wanderers.</p>

<p>This arrangement came to an end eighty years ago, with the invention of the Badges. The Guild was considered unnecessary for the purposes of the Order. The Regulator's Guild was due to be diminished in importance, until a minor Wanderer of unknown origins, Lawrence Michaels, asked for the Guildmaster's position. Michaels broke with the Minders Guild, and expanded into investigative services.</p>

<p>The Guild, today, is a true, if minor, political player: they offer protection services that are surprisingly low-priced; they operate in the Hive, helping police the worst of the worst; they act as investigators for hire; they still offer mercenary services, but of a different (and usually cheaper) sort than the Sodkillers. They also have a lot of information about various... interesting things, and have been hired by the oddest of organizations.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Goals:</span></p>

<p>If you are dealing with a Wanderer, you're either dealing with a Ronin (whose modus operandi are to wander around, doing good deeds as needed), or a member of the Regulator's Guild. Ronin usually don't care about politics, and have no discernible goals besides fighting the good fight, and maintaining the good name of the Order (and giving people interested in joining up directions to find Old Jenny's kip in Arborea, where there are people who will be more then happy to help you in your quest).</p>

<p>Members of the Regulator's Guild are slightly different. They tend to be much more politically aware, if only because they usually operate out of Sigil for hire, and thus are more likely to come into contact with political arguments of one sort or another. Their goals are usually fairly simple: Make sure the righteous are protected from evil; make sure no innocents are needlessly killed; make sure the job you were hired to do gets done; make sure that the wicked are punished, and the truly evil are killed, in roughly that order.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Politics:</span></p>

<p>The Ronin are not involved in planar politics all that much, except as a thorn in the side of various fiends (especially the Yugoloths).</p>

<p>The Regulator's Guild, on the other hand, have some complicated relations with the Factions and groups in Sigil. </p>

<p>The Corporations from the Upper Planes frequently subcontract out to the Guild when they need extra muscle or security. Most other kinds of Corporations (even some who hail from the Lower Planes) occasionally hire the Guild when they need short term security or extra muscle for legitimate (if not always exactly legal) jobs. The Guild, for its part, tends to view most Corporate jobs as things to do when you don't have anything more important to do; the prevailing view is that Corporations are a tool, one that can also be made into a mask for dark deeds.</p>

<p>The Police Force tends to view the Regulator's with strong distaste (thanks to the influence of the Hardhead members and the 'loths), but is not actually persecuting them; they are, after all, almost always on the right side of the Law; and when they aren't, they're usually on the right side of Justice, and willing to take the punishment for their crimes (those who aren't... well, let's just say that they almost never have a rose on their Badges, and leave it at that). The Guild, due its frequent dealings with the police in various capacities, is likely to react to the individual policeman, not the badge; truly corrupt policemen are viewed as problems to be overcome, while honest policemen are treated with politeness and respect.</p>

<p>The rest of the City government generally doesn't care that much for the Guild (they've been involved in some pretty spectacular property damage over the years), but not to the point of actually dislike (after all, said property damage was usually incurred in the process of preventing the deaths of large numbers of citizens). The Guild members usually have varying dealings with the government according to the corruption level of the individual and branch of City government.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Movers and Shakers:</span></p>

<p>The Wanderers can be roughly broken up into three sub-orders, classified by leader:</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Lawrence Michaels:</span></p>

<p>The Guildmaster of the Regulator's Guild, Michaels is a cunning, clever, and above all dangerous being of unknown origins. He looks like a fit human male (although, given that he's been around more than two hundred years without aging a day, has never been known to sleep, and isn't undead, the assumption that he isn't in any way truly human is fairly common), with black hair and dark brown eyes. His demeanor is unfailingly polite and courteous, even when the guns come out.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Bill:</span></p>

<p>The most notable of the Ronin subgroup, and by most accounts the closest thing the Ronin have to a leader, Bill is rather tall, and even more subject to the Chaond's racial tendency to shift in appearance than is normal; his facial features have been known to change from day to day. His personality, on the other hand, is less variable then is typical for a Chaond, or for that matter, anybody who has spent a large amount of time in Limbo. He earns a decent living as a gambler, and tends to wait a while longer before taking action than most of his peers.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Old Jenny:</span></p>

<p>The closest thing the Order has to a Factol or a Sectol, Old Jenny is the leader of the Supporters, who are mainly responsible for the training of new members, and what support services the Order maintains (usually just equipment). "Old Jenny" is actually a nickname; her original name and history are unknown, as she was found by some Wanderers sixty years ago after being forcibly administered water from the Styx by person or persons unknown, and, other then an occasional vague hint, no information has been forthcoming. Jenny is middle aged (for an elf), and is the inventor of the Badges.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">A Minor Item of Interest:</span></p>

<p>The Wanderers are right at the boundary between Faction and Sect; depending on how you define "Faction" and "Sect", they can be called a Faction, Sect, both (if your definitions are too loose), neither (if your definitions are too restrictive), or just bloody nuisances (if your operations have been foiled by their members too frequently).</p> <div class="dice_rolls">
