I would like to first thank David &quot;Zeb&quot; Cook and the entire
Planescape team for coming up with the a way to make Gary Gygax's idea
of other dimensions of existence even more thoughtful, funny,
cosmopolitan and all together fun, along with many anonymous
planewalkers over here who helped out a green like me. I would secondly
like to thank the Dungeon Master's Guide II for inspiration for this
idea in a relatively short, but insightful sidebar.
</p>
<p>
You see, I'm talking about the idea of human archtypes; some players
(not here, of course) many of the times pick human as they're race all
the time, not for the traits it offers or because it's easier to
roleplay, but because it's more historically accurate and they don't
want to break the fantasy of Arthurian tales by playing dwarves of
elves. Of course, sometimes they like the idea of gaining different
mechanics or just playing someone that the race represents, such as the
witty gnome trickster or the outcast anti-hero that half-orcs give so
many opportunities to play, and of course, it breaks the fantasy if
other players play a celestial feral half-dragon half-elf paragons.
But, like the DMG II pointed out, you can have your cake and eat it
too, and so can your players. This is represented in this example as
archtypes, humans who have traits related to races, such as
preternaturally charismatic and socialites (half-elves) or short,
gypsy-like knaves who are especially sneaky and brave (halflings).
</p>
<p>
4th edition left a lot of people in the dumps, but my fear is that
for everything it is, it left you guys in the worst area. The planes
have become a haphazard place, the entire order of the multiverse
becoming erratic and without any hope of the history or flavor of the
planes being recovered. But, as a D&amp;D evolutionist and a sly man of
the city, I'm used to making a few changes to something to get the most
out of it with the least harm, I ask you: is it? Does everything have
to thrown away because the names of the planes and some of the flavor
has been changed? I say no, and there's a reason in the 4th Edition
Dungeon Master's Guide why you shouldn't either: Acheron. Yes, the
Infernal Battlefield, the War amongst the Cubes, the medium between
Baator and Mechanus is why you should not give up on the past of
Planescape while staying in the present of Dungeons and Dragons. All's
it takes is a little placement and reordering, and here's how.
</p>
<p>
The basic premise of the planes is 4 planes (with 2 extra if you
count the Abyss located in the Elemental Chaos and the Far Realm
located in the belly button of a vacuum mephit, or wherever it might
be): The Feywild, Shadowfell, Astral Sea and Elemental Chaos. The
planes that made these are fairly obvious (Shadowfell = Plane of
Shadows, Elemental Chaos = elemental planes and Limbo, etc.) and that
leaves the rest of the planes mentioned to just vanish. Sure, there's
the Nine Hells and the Celestial Mountain in the astral sea, but that
really seems about it. But then I heard about a Acheron in the astral
sea, how from it's description, it hasn't changed in the smallest. I
then realized that it hadn't changed, it was the same place as it ever
was, just a part of the bigger picture. Now with this in mind, I
thought what else in the astral sea? Mechanus? Bytopia? Gehenna? Then I
thought about what could be in the other planes, what happened to
Ysgard and Canceri and the other planes of existence that made up the
multiverse and inspired a whole culture of gamers and intellectualists?
So I made a list, a list of where everything went in all of existence,
and here it is:
</p>
<p>
The Ethereal Plane - Split between the Shadowfell and the Feywild,
as both deal with spirits of the dead and the mysterious powers of the
unknown that lurks in the mists
</p>
<p>
The Plane of Shadows - Of course, this was is the basis of the Shadowfell
</p>
<p>
The Astral Plane - What became the Astral Sea
</p>
<p>
The Elemental, Paraelemental and Quasielemental planes - As a plane
alternating constantly between billowing winds and solid rock, burning
magma and freezing cold, awesome colors and desiccating salt, the
Elemental Chaos fits this to a key
</p>
<p>
Negative Energy Plane - if the Plane of Shadows is the basis of the
Shadowfell, the faded colors and emotions and the source of many undead
mark the Negative Energy Plane as the power of the Shadowfell. In fact,
it is my belief that the black orb in the starless sky of this murky
plane is similar to what it used to be in previous editions, perhaps
being a passage way to the darker elements of the Elemental Chaos
</p>
<p>
Positive Energy Plane - if the Negative Energy Plane powers the
Shadowfell, it's the Positive Energy Plane the makes up the Feywild
with it's bright colors and enviorment teeming with life. Perhaps the
bright orb in this plane's sky is the way to what was the positive
quasielemental planes just like Shadowfell's orb.
</p>
<p>
Ysgard - With it's lush, lively terrain and and resurrecting traits
as well as the presence of elves, this would have to be in the Feywild,
but with such extreme elemental traits and lawless atmosphere, this
plane would have to border the Elemental Chaos, as well
</p>
<p>
Limbo - Despite being a former outer plane, Limbo has become the
power of the elemental chaos, keeping the elements from resolving each
other and leaving only one dominant, or a great big mess that would
just destroy it's own section of existence.
</p>
<p>
Pandemonium - Though it's actually located in the elemental chaos,
this probably belongs in the Abyss, or at least close to the end of the
maelstrom where the Abyss is located.
</p>
<p>
Abyss - The end of the Elemental Chaos, it's own maelstrom of entropy and wanton destruction
</p>
<p>
Caneri - A section of the Abyss, perhaps the prison that holds Tharizdun and other malign gods, primordials and cursed artifacts
</p>
<p>
Hades - A place of despair and a home to lost souls, this plane fits the Shadowfell
</p>
<p>
Gehenna - With it's high, rocky mountains, acidic hail, deadly
hurling lava balls and suffocating smoke, Gehenna is placed in the
lower sections of the Elemental Chaos, but as queer and contradictory
as it is, the yugoloths brought this plane down from the Astral Sea and
there are still places where transferring through the plane to the
godly domains.
</p>
<p>
Baator - In a place of chocking smoke, where the radiant rainbows
and milky white colors become black goo that seems to stick only to the
conscious and the soul. Baator, or the Nine Hells, haven't changed,
berk; same thing, different place; in this case, the Astral Sea
</p>
<p>
Acheron - The inspiration of this article, Acheron is placed in
Astral Sea; A place where two gods constantly do battle with each
other, where soldiers suffer tragic and gruesome deaths, not once, but
for all eternity fits the immortal theme of the Astral Sea
</p>
<p>
Mechanus - Angels are physical beings formed from ideas and composed
from astral threads of the plane, in this case, as the word(s) of
god(s): Justice. Valor. Vengeance. Healing. Perhaps we'll hear about
darker angels, one that represent ideals such as greed, hate and
darkness. But as the Elemental Chaos is a place of anarchy perfected,
the idea of perfected laws and true order make the astral energies into
ever churning, always moving gears with beings composed of both the
metallic nature of the law and the life-like, organic parts of divinity.
</p>
<p>
Arcadia - A place of harmony and of true community, this place looks
under the defence and peace of the gods that reside in the Astral Sea
</p>
<p>
Celestia - A shining mountain that holds beings of strength and
virtue on shining, opaque waters, The Shining Mountain lies on the
Astral Sea
</p>
<p>
Bytopia - However tame and civilized the Twin Paradises' seem, it is
still a very wild place where beasts attack visitors and the wilds are
just that and thus inhabits the Feywild. Still, there are some
mountains that seems to only go one way, and at the end is surrounded
by a silvery white light.
</p>
<p>
Elysium - This place makes up the softer sections of the Feywild.
Small marshes, pleasent bogs and other such watery area make up this
section of this plane.
</p>
<p>
Beastlands - An wild domain of hundreds of different beasts, both
natural and from planes abound, the Beastlands belong in the Feywild
</p>
<p>
Arborea - One would suspect that Arborea would fall into the
Feywild, but because Correlon places his domain on Arvandor and
Sehanine occasionally travels there, Arborea is set in both the Astral
Sea and the Feywild
</p>
<p>
Outlands - Strangely enough, the home of the Spire doesn't seem to
exist in the standard geography of the multiverse. Rather, it seems to
be outside the order of the planes, perhaps at the very center of the
planes (of course, with an infinity, not to say multiple infinities,
there is no real center). Because of (insert multiversal, plane
shattering cataclysm  here), almost a dozen gatetowns have been
demolished, the ones remaining? Converted into 4 entirely different
towns: Sovereign (Astral Sea), Snafu (Elemental Chaos), Sylvan
(Feywild) and Umbra (Shadowfell).

<p>
So let's go over where the planes went in the multiverse:
</p>
<p>
Feywild: Ethereal Plane (half), Positive Energy Plane (powers),
Ysgard, Bytopia, Beastland, Arborea (half), Elysium, Sylvan (gatetown)
</p>
<p>
Shadowfell: Ethereal Plane (half), Plane of Shadows (basis), Negativ Energy Plane (powers), Hades, Umbra (gatetown)
</p>
<p>
Astral Sea - Astral Plane (basis), Gehenna (bordered), Baator,
Acheron, Mechanus, Arcadia, Celestia, Bytopia (bordered), Soveriegn
(gatetown)
</p>
<p>
Elemental Chaos - Elemental Plane (basis), Limbo (powers), Abyss,
Canceri (Abyss), Ysgard (bordered), Gehenna (Abyss), Snafu (gatetown)
</p>
<p></p>

<p>And is it with the end of this list that I would like to say<br />
that with 4th Edition we should not say goodbye to Planescape (or any<br />
other setting, really, that relies on the cosmology; things like<br />
Spelljammer and Ravenloft are just as safe), but to say hello to brand<br />
new concepts: How tieflings are now all royal heirs to a fallen empire,<br />
how angels and elementals impact the Blood War with the line of Baator<br />
and Abyss blurred into a bigger pictures, and Primordials.<br />
</p><br />
<p><br />
Otogi<br />

Nice stuff. I agree with most of your placements. I would suggest this, though:

The Outlands replaces the natural world, and takes on aspects of it. It is a place where mortals rule a wild and rugged landscape with magic, and you can still easily battle orcs and dragons. The gate-towns become the centers of civilization, and the Spire still sits under Sigil, the true center of the multiverse.
