          Ortho: Factions (small F) in the Orthorian Central Authority        </div>

</div> <p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-weight:bold">Factions (small F) in the Orthorian Central Authority</span></span></p>

<p>It’s the nature of mortals to categorise each other, dividing themselves by culture, creed, religion, philosophy, and a thousand other attributes. It’s no surprise then, that there are numerous ideologies, strategies, and schools of thought that come under the broad category of Harmonium philosophy. Its also common knowledge that certain Provinces are favourable (or hostile) to different specific schools of thought: Shoryko for example, is renowned for favouring hardline tactics and rigid stratification.</p>

<p>There are no real political parties on Ortho, because officially there is only a single school of political thought and a single philosophy behind it. The School of Ethics has ruled that dividing politics along even apparently minor lines of belief inevitably creates division, polarisation, and eventually conflict, so officially everyone is in the same ‘party’ politically speaking. Inevitably however, people view the philosophy of universal harmony in different ways, and the like-minded naturally form alliances in the Council of Ortho and Octave. The views of most politicians are well known among their fellows.</p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-weight:bold">Cautioners</span></span><br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Preferred Form of Harmony: </span>Concentration on stability<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Principle Allies: </span>Juhlienists, Hardliners<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Principle Enemies: </span>Colonial Alliance, Federalists, Technocrats</p>

<p>“Slow and steady wins the race” is the motto of the Cautioners. Their constant mantra is stability, firm foundations, and careful progress: With progress comes change, and with change comes chaos and conflict. All change must be carefully managed in order to minimise the chaos of change. Cautioners use their influence to keep technological and magical progress slow but steady rate. They have strong influence in several bureaus, but are strongest at mid-level, where its members control licenses, patents, research grants, and the like. They are venomously opposed to Technocrat lobbyists, afraid that one of their innovations might have repercussions causing untold harm to Ortho.</p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-weight:bold">Colonial Alliance</span></span><br />
[<span style="font-weight:bold">Preferred Form of Harmony: </span>Provincial Status for Colonies<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Principle Allies: </span>Liberals<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Principle Enemies: </span>Hardliners</p>

<p>The Colonial Alliance has a simple and very public objective: The ascension of (well behaved) colony-worlds to full Provincial status. Following on from this, they also favour decentralisation of the OCA and the establishment of ‘World Councils’ to act as the Council of Ortho for their worlds. They concentrate their efforts in the political arena, but also arrange high-profile public campaigns to garner support from the people. Intagril and Meter are the most vocal advocates of this cause.</p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-weight:bold">Democrats</span></span><br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Preferred Form of Harmony: </span>Democracy<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Principle Allies:</span> Federalists, Liberals<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Principle Enemies: </span>Juhlienists, Hardliners</p>

<p>Democrats want an OCA in which the supreme power is vested in the people and exercised directly by them or by elected agents under a free electoral system. The current system limits ‘people power’ far too much, they claim, with a rallying cry of “the strength of the pillar lays at its base!” Compulsory voting is their current call, but they also tend to be crusaders against all forms of political corruption. They often find themselves in an uneasy alliance with the Liberals, sharing some of their ideals but not their general tolerance.</p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-weight:bold">Federalists</span></span><br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Preferred Form of Harmony: </span>Confederacy of States<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Principle Allies: </span>Colonial Alliance<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Principle Enemies: </span>Juhlienists</p>

<p>Federalists favour more independence for Provinces (and occasionally for nations within those Provinces), and would like to see Ortho more like a confederacy of nation states; cooperating on philosophy, religion, and foreign policy but sovereign in their own power and destiny - a lot less unified than the “one nation, one people” philosophy usually espoused by the Harmonium. This has left them somewhat on the fringe of Orthorian politics, but this issue is much more popular among colonial politicians. Federalists run the gamut from the moderate to the extreme – relatively few of them actually want to break up the very successful system currently in place. Most simply wish to replace a portion of the OCA’s power with that of individual nations and Provinces. </p>

<p>The Council of Ortho is where the Federalist view finds it easiest to take hold, although most of its ‘grass roots’ support comes from various kings, presidents, and prime ministers in each Province. Meter is the spiritual home of the Federalists – but also the place where they are most carefully watched: The Harmonium is keen to prevent a philosophical repeat of the ‘Meter Incident’.</p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-weight:bold">Hardliners</span></span><br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Preferred Form of Harmony: </span>Heavy law enforcement and a rigid social strata<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Principal Allies:</span> Juhlienists<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Principle Enemies: </span>Liberals</p>

<p>Hardliners come from all walks of life, but they are unified in their belief that the Harmonium and the OCA is too lenient on its recanters, antipodes, and open enemies. The want to see harsher laws, more restrictions of the movement of population (both geographical and social), a more aggressive and interventionist military policy, and more active control over the lives of citizens. Most subscribers have seen trouble caused by the Harmonium’s attempts to ‘play nice’ and many hardliners also believe that for the good of Harmony, its champions should learn to fight more ruthlessly. Most Hardliners also want to increase the power and reach of the Harmonium. </p>

<p>Many hardliners are dedicated to a single issue (such as closing the Licensed Quarters, compulsory alignment checks, mandatory military service for criminals, etc), but ally with those of similar beliefs out of political necessity. Many career soldiers ascribe to the hardline view, as do many devils of the planar Harmonium and Ortho’s nobility (especially those in Shoryko). Hardline sympathy waxes and wanes with the fortunes of the Pax Harmonium. After the Schism and War of Iron it was very popular, but public support melts away in times of peace and stability.</p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-weight:bold">Juhlienists</span></span><br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Preferred Harmony:</span> Military dictatorship<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Principal Allies:</span> Hard-liners<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Principle Enemies:</span> Democrats, Federalists</p>

<p>The Juhlienists believe that things would be better if the Harmonium simply ran everything – in essence a benevolent military dictatorship. Their philosophy is similar to that of Juhlien, the ‘last true Composer’ as they call him. They want to expand Harmonium power into all walks of Orthorian life; taking control of church, provincial and world government, and even social life.</p>

<p>This belief tends to be most popular among mid-ranked officers (Measure 1 to 4) as these are the ranks high enough to have dealings with Ortho’s sometimes tangled bureaucracy and politics, yet not high enough in rank to force the issue in their favour. It’s not too hard to find citizens of all ranks who believe that “one honest forthright man can do more than an army of quill-pushers.” Of course, the Juhlienists also have their fair share of power mad would-be-dictators as well. A few high-profile incidents involving arrogant Juhlienists overstepping their authority has soured opinion against their agenda (as does the clear danger of dictatorship) and the very fact that they identify so strongly with Juhlien doesn’t endear them to the OCA much either.</p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-weight:bold">Levellers</span></span><br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Preferred form of Harmony: </span>Abolition of all social classes<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Principal Allies: </span>Liberals<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Principle Enemies: </span>Hardliners, Old Guard, New Elite</p>

<p>Levellers believe that division lies at the heart of the seemingly unified world of Ortho. Despite countless reforms, nobles still rule over ‘commoners’ and the poor suffer at the hands of the rich. Levellers want the OCA to abolish all social classes apart from Citizen. In their preferred form of harmony, only a person’s job gives them authority over anyone else: Nobility would be abolished and undeserved wealth garnered by birth should be distributed to the poor. Everyone would exist in the same economic state and be equal in the eyes of society and the law. Many Levellers even go so far as to say that all property should be owned by the State.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, Leveller philosophy is more popular among the Have Nots than the Haves. The poor and disenfranchised are its most ardent supporters, especially members of the huihui and people ‘kept in line’ by more oppressive Provinces, like Motmurk, Shoryko, and South Thaera. The Levellers have their champions in the courts and the higher echelons of the state too, but their faction is weak at the highest levels of government, where the traditional ‘ruling classes’ dominate. Levellers have a lot of support outside the OCA in the form of poorly paid workers (especially those in a huihui), but the militant behaviour of these supporters often does more harm than good to the Leveller’s political cause.</p>

<span style="font-weight:bold">Principal Allies: </span>Democrats, Federalists<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Principle Enemies: </span>Hardliners</p>

<p>Liberals (sometimes called ‘freedomists’) believe that at the essence of harmony is freedom, and that true commitment to the Harmonium comes only through freedom to make the right choice. They believe in granting the maximum individual freedom possible to individual citizens, guaranteed by OCA law and secured by the Harmonium; an equal freedom for all. They favour the relaxation of Ortho’s more restrictive laws and in opening dialogue with its enemies to achieve a peaceful solution to conflicts. Many liberals are committed pacifists.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for its advocates, Orthorian liberalism is a relatively easy target for its critics, particularly because liberalism has always been connected with civil unrest on Ortho: Protests, sabotage, occasional riots, and other disharmonious behaviour. There’s also a string perception of Liberals as unrealistic, idealistic ‘do-gooders’ who don’t appreciate the realities of life. The liberals claim that this is deliberate propaganda by the Information Control Executive – and exactly the sort of thing they want to remove from Orthorian society. </p>

<span style="font-weight:bold">Preferred from of Harmony:</span> Strong merchant class and bureaucracy; weak nobility<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Principal Allies: </span>Democrats<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Principle Enemies: </span>Juhlienists, Old Guard</p>

<p>The New Elite is an alliance of merchants and bureaucrats, almost all commoners, who have risen to power in the OCA. Persistent peace, stability, and wealth on Ortho have created a powerful ‘middle class’ of independent merchants and land owners. The new elite are heavily involved with the Cartels, and usually concentrate on economic policies it views as favourable. Many of the New Elite are also administrators who rose to power as the OCA bureaucracy developed.</p>

<p>The Old Guard has suffered most in the rise of the New Elite, and the two blocs are bitter enemies.</p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-weight:bold">Old Guard</span></span><br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Preferred from of Harmony: </span>Strong nobility; weak merchant class<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Principal Allies: </span>Juhlienists <br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Principle Enemies: </span>Democrats, New Elite</p>

<p>The Old Guard is formed by noble families and a fair smattering of nobles under other names – (“lord protectors” and the like) who managed to hold on to power when the OCA was formed. Their aim is to preserve their power, privilege, and prestige as much as possible, and maintain the ‘social contract’ of feudalism as much as possible. Although the Old Guard has its share of uncaring and exploitative nobles, there are many members who genuinely care for the commoners under their rule and try to do what’s best for them – and more than a few who simply don’t trust the merchant classes and New Elite to do what’s right. There’s a fair amount of bitterness too; many noble families lost out during the rise of the World State and “the commoners” profited directly from it.</p>

<p>The Old Guard has strong ties to the Churches of Order and the Harmonium, because of age-old noble traditions of entering these professions. </p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-weight:bold">Technologists</span></span><br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Preferred form of Harmony: </span>Prosperity through advanced technology/Peace through superior firepower<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Principal Allies: </span>Colonial Alliance, Federalists<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Principle Enemies: </span>Cautioners, Old Guard</p>

<p>Technologists generally come in one of two varieties: They want to create a better world with advanced technology and/or magic, or they want to destroy the enemies of the Harmonium by those methods. Technologists are united by their drive to advance and frustrated by the ever-cautious attitude of the OCA (even those not actually Cautioners). The work tirelessly to support scholars and inventors in both the Harmonium and civilian life.</p>

<p>The Technologists’ main enemies are obviously the Cautioner bloc, but the Old Guard is also opposed to them because they fear that advancement will threaten their power and increase the influence of the Cartels even more. The Technologists are a small power bloc, but have recently formed a strong alliance with the Colonial Alliance and Federalists; the former because of the colonies have produced great innovations in recent years and the latter because they hope to expand their influence in individual Provinces and nations if they can’t persuade the OCA as a whole.</p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-weight:bold">Theocrats</span></span><br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Preferred form of Harmony:</span> Theocracy<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Principal Allies: </span>Juhlienists <br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Principle Enemies: </span>Liberals</p>

<p>The Lords of Order already enjoy a strong position in Orthorian society, occupying one third of the ‘three pillars of state’, but the church bloc wants to make the Lords of Order even more central to the philosophy of harmony. Most of them are simply devout men and women who wish to promote their faith, but more extreme members want a genuine theocracy instead of the current political system, more aggressive crusades against the heathens, or to turn the Harmonium into true templars of the churches.</p>

<p>The Theocrats suffer from many internal divisions. Many devout worshippers believe that only their deity as the real exemplar of harmony, and want their faith’s tenets to be supreme other those of lesser deities. These rivalries are one of the main reasons that this faction is not more powerful.</p>       </div>

          Ortho: Factions (small F) in the Orthorian Central Authority        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>I love what you've done with this. One question: is there one for curbing the Harmonium's power? I think a lot of people in the OCA would be secretly affiliated with that, and would make a good counterpoint to the Juhlienists and Hardliners. Here's just an addendum. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Political Factions and the Octave.</span><br />
The Octave Council is supposed to be one unified and impartial government body acting in concert for the betterment of all. Therefore, it would be horribly improper (not to mention political suicide) for a member of the Octave Council to openly admit to being allied with any of Ortho's political organizations. It would certainly cause a scandal, and, if the the Council of Ortho is sufficiently angered, the offender's removal. </p>

<p>As a result, most Octaves keep their political affiliations close to their chests, even in private. Nevertheless, an Octave's actions and speeches can be revealing, and even if they aren't, they often have something lurking in their pasts that is. Of the current Octaves, a few ideological links stand out.</p>

<p>Conductor Brownbrow has denounced political extremists of all stripes (with particular venom directed at the Juhlienists, Old Guard, and Theocrats). In his youth, he was a member of Levelers, but few remember that these days and he always makes a point of studiously ignoring the whole thing.</p>

<p>Conductor Xiu generally has no time for politics, but her speeches suggest that she is really a Hardliner at heart. Strangely, she does not seem to want anything to do with the Juhlienists.</p>

<p>Conductor Faith knows relatively little about Ortho's political divisions and shows little interest in learning. However, the mere rumor that she is connected with the Colonial Alliance has proven to be a major sticking point with the Council.</p>

<p>Conductor Telomi`ir has long been associated with the Hardliners (although even they are distancing themselves from him these days), but is otherwise unaffiliated. Then again, that might be because he was already an old beholder when these political philosophies first sprung up and he is nothing if not stubborn.</p>

<p>Conductor Ironfist has always kept his political beliefs close to his chest and nothing in his past reveals more. That does not stop people from speculating, however.</p>

<p>Conductor Akerikos was a member of the Leveler and Restrainer blocs while on the Council and, although he's quieter about it now, his beliefs have not changed. He also has ties to the Federalists and Liberals and absolutely despises Juhlienists and Hardliners, and makes no effort to hide it.</p>

<p>Conductor Sirrock is one of the spiritual leaders of the Theocratic movement and it was with their support (and that of the Orc bloc) that he was elected. This has led many, including Brownbrow, to accuse him of being a would-be dictator, and Sirrock's habit of sicking his Sinhunters on his detractors has done nothing to help his reputation.</p>

<p>Conductor Tzuro got her seat on the Octave by making a lot of promises to members of both the Old Guard and the Cautioners that she would pursue their interests and enforce the status quo. Time will tell as to whether she keeps her promises.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Just the addendum I was hoping for.  <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/smile.png" title="Smiling" alt="Smiling" class="smiley-content"/> I didn’t want to mess with your NPCs or put words in their mouths (or agendas in their heads), but I think that these blocs help to add some depth to the otherwise standard "lawful alignment/Harmonium philosophy" of Ortho...</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;Duckluck&#039;</em> wrote:</div>One question: is there one for curbing the Harmonium's power? I think a lot of people in the OCA would be secretly affiliated with that, and would make a good counterpoint to the Juhlienists and Hardliners. Here's just an addendum.</div></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">“I’m sorry citizen, but your comments have been deemed inharmonious and in contravention of the public good. Please remain calm; officers will be along shortly to escort you to a relaxation and re-education centre in deepest Shoryko. Thank you for your cooperation.”</span></p>

<p>Oh, okay then…</p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-weight:bold">Restrainers</span></span><br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Preferred Form of Harmony: </span>Limited Harmonium Power<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Principle Allies: </span>Colonial Alliance, Federalists, Liberals<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Principle Enemies: </span>Hardliners, Juhlienists </p>

<p>Few political philosophies exist on more delicate ground than that of the Restrainers, for they dare to argue that Harmonium power is too widespread and should be curbed, refocused, and redirected in a more limited direction. Often called ‘Leashers’ by their enemies, the Restrainer bloc suffers from a strong historical prejudice: During the formative years of the OCA, whenever the Harmonium was held back from acting, the consequences always seemed to turn out worse than if they had been set loose. The Knights of Harmony themselves were strong opponents of Restrainer principles, and the populace have taken their arguments to heart. </p>

<p>Few dissenters are brave enough to speak loudly of curbing the Harmonium’s power (more than a few fear reprisals, as well) but in general it is the apparent success of the system that’s the biggest weight against their views in the public mind. Proponents of “a proper critique of the system” are more sophisticated than the ranting anti-hardheads they are often accused of being. Those openly Restrainer are usually careful to couch their ideas in constructive and conciliatory terms.</p>

<p>At least publicly, they are a small political bloc. Relatively few of their number make their opinions known strongly or in public, because open criticism of the system undoubtedly damages a political career. It’s not hard to find Restrainer-tendencies in many other political groups however; especially those who want to see increased power in other agencies. The Colonial Alliance, Federalists, Liberals, Technologists, Theocrats, and Levellers, all have some common ground with their beliefs. Many Restrainers would also prefer to see the OCA (or the temples) assuming some or all of the Harmonium’s moral authority.</p>

<p>There are many reasons why someone might lean towards Restraint: For many it is the fear that the Hardheads are spread too thinly. These Restrainers call for ‘refocusing’ of the Harmonium on a narrower goal than it currently enjoys. Some of them believe that the Hardheads should leave public security alone and concentrate on military threats outside the OCA, others believe that ‘crusading’ should be scaled back in favour of internal security, or that the Outer Planes should be abandoned in favour of a purely Prime Material agenda. A few even believe that military activities and the Harmonium’s ‘hearts and minds’ moral guardianship should be strictly separated.</p>

<p>More hardcore Restrainers are usually on the periphery of power. They call themselves “anti-Tyranists” and claim that without greater accountability and power sharing, there’s always the danger that – however benevolent it is now – the Harmonium might one day come to be dominated by selfish and power-hungry individuals who could turn the OCA into a military dictatorship. Even more extreme opinions (“it already is a military dictatorship in all but name!”) cross the line of responsible politics and are disavowed - such claims are illegal under OCA law and the any Anti-Tyranists who support it are part of a proscribed organisation that their moderate cousins claim to abhor. The reputation of these rebels continues to dog the more responsible Restrainer cause however, and the hardcore Anti-Tyranists have done little to curb the excesses of their extremist brethren.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Bravo armory, I think that you should probably keep the above articles at the same length and trim the Restrainers.  </p>

<p>Most understand the need for caution in the Harmonium, I think, and you've done a wonderful job in illustrating it but it could probably look a little like this.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Restrainers</span><br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Preferred Form of Harmony</span>: Limited Harmonium Power<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Principle Allies</span>: Colonial Alliance, Federalists, Liberals<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Principle Enemies</span>: Hardliners, Juhlienists </p>

<p>Few political philosophies exist on more delicate ground than that of the Restrainers, for they dare to argue that Harmonium power is too widespread and should be curbed, refocused, and redirected in a more limited direction. Often called ‘Leashers’ by their enemies, the Restrainer bloc suffers from a strong historical prejudice: During the formative years of the OCA, whenever the Harmonium was held back from acting, the consequences always seemed to turn out worse than if they had been set loose. The Knights of Harmony themselves were strong opponents of Restrainer principles, and the populace have taken their arguments to heart.</p>

<p>More hardcore Restrainers are usually on the periphery of power. They call themselves “anti-Tyranists” and claim that without greater accountability and power sharing, there’s always the danger that – however benevolent it is now – the Harmonium might one day come to be dominated by selfish and power-hungry individuals who could turn the OCA into a military dictatorship. </p>

<p>***</p>

<p>But all of that good stuff should be saved for different parts of the book I think.  Besiders, the Levelers seem like much better targets that the Restrainers.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">
