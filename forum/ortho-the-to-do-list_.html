        <div class="dice_rolls">
</div> <p>I was wondering where we are with the Ortho Project and a good place to sart would be a what's left to do list...But before that gets done, I was wondering what will be done with what's already been done...Clueless, what's gonna be done with the work already 'completed'?...Are you gonna re-write what's been written?...</p>

<p>For instance, that which has been written for the various provinces seems to have many different forms...Some seem to be standard 'Campaign Book' nation entries, some are histories and/or listing of peoples, some are a series of sites and some still need to be written (Karazam, the Thaeran provinces)...Will there be a uniformity of entries?...</p>

<p>I guess, my reason for asking for a to do list is that I'm not sure what there is left for we contributors to do and what it is you (Clueless) will be doing for the final 'product'...There's a lot of great stuff there, I'm just not sure (or I've forgotten and am too lazy to go over the almost [or is it more than]  30 pages of posts) where we're at and where we're going...</p>

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>The following list has some tasks listed in <span style="font-weight:bold">bold </span>- these are the ones that need attention asap. The tasks listed in <span style="font-style:italic">italics </span>are either already in the works on my end as an edittor, or just not that critical as of yet. For the most part the less important tasks are those that are pure drudgery and editting work - not the creative end of things (and hence their lowered importance for a general To Do list).</p>

<p>Stats are *really* our biggest need.</p>

<p>To Do:</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Statblocks and background for ALL MAJOR NPCs - leaders, high ranking Harmonium, religious leaders, adventurers - include plot hooks</span><br />
This one is critically important. People are what plots get hooked on. People are *nessecary* for this to be a world able to be played in.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Example plots for DM section (and other useful DM tips)</span><br />

Write overview of travel, coinage, trade and economics<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Write overview of religion in society (example interactions of temple to the average villager)</span><br />
Write merfolk relations to land provinces, rough society overview<br />

         <p>I can write up NPC stats, monsters, and even a Prestige Class or two. I'm no expert at it, but then again it's not really that hard. Lord (Vecna) knows that it beats studying. Seriously Clueless, just PM me a character concept that needs stats, or a character name that needs a concept <span style="font-style:italic">and</span> stats and I'll get to work.</p>

<p>Otherwise, I'll start wading through the myriad threads to see what needs doing, but that may take a while. Actually that might be your problem. The setting has been in development for so long and has had so many ideas tossed around that only a few people who have been following it for a while actually know what's what. I think everyone else is just sort of intimidated. I know when I started reading through the threads that I gradually began to wonder if I'd ever have a good grasp of what the "finished" parts were. Turned me off to the whole thing. At any rate, Azriael is right, this setting is too good to leave unfinished, so consider me to be reporting for duty.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>There's a PDF I've been working from actually that I recommend now as the starting point for folks. It's a lot easier to follow where things are going on that. The threads were useful when we had everyone going and posting on them all at once - but as time has passed... that feeling of being in the middle of a conversation fades. It's harder to jump in on it via the threads and I don't expect people to. <img src="http://23.92.31.81/planewalker.com/sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/wink.png" title="Eye-wink" alt="Eye-wink" class="smiley-content"/></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Now - in my defense - it's about half edited so far. I've been stitching together what's on the forums with what's in this PDF and expanding upon it, adding in to fill in the blanks. But pardon the dust of construction, some of the PDF has massive grammar and transition issues b/c that hasn't been fixed yet. <img src="http://23.92.31.81/planewalker.com/sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/wink.png" title="Eye-wink" alt="Eye-wink" class="smiley-content"/></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

          Ortho: The To Do List        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Well, a lot of it looks like it's still in the speculation phases, there are some pretty huge gaps in places, and pretty much everything is in need of some solid editing, but yeah, it looks like we're well on our way to having a finished rough draft. </p>

<p>A few things I've noticed that look like problems so far:</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">1.</span> Some of the Feats and Prestige Classes have serious issues and several are either poorly-balanced or simply wouldn't work as written. The worst instance of this would be "Harmonic Head-ringing" which requires an absurd six feats, is only usable with a specific set of weapons, and is so confusingly written that it's hard to tell whether it's over-powered or under-powered (hint: it's the first one). The feat's only redeeming value is that it requires so many feats to get in that people aren't going to have a lot of space left to combine it with Power Critical to make it really abusive. Other feats and class abillities have similar flaws although I haven't seen any others that were quite that bad, but a few were close. Careful editing can alleviate this, however.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">2.</span> We have yet to define the true relation of the Harmonium faction to Ortho's government. In some places it lists the three pillars of society as being: the Government, the Church, and the Harmonium, but in other places it says nearly everyone on Ortho is a member of the Harmonium Faction, and in still other places it says that the Harmonium doesn't really exist on Ortho in the strict sense and instead what cagers see as the Harmonium Faction are simply trappings the Orthan explorers took on so they'd blend with the other factions. In my mind, these statements really aren't reconcilable, but the one that seems to work best for the setting as it is now written is a combination of the three. </p>

<p>Basically, when people use the phrase "Harmonium" they seem to be talking about one of four things: all or nearly all citizens of the Ortho empire, the Orthan government and its representatives, the Orthan millitary, or just the planar branch of the Orthan millitary (the "faction" we're familiar with). Seriously, look through that PDF. Every section seems to have a different working definition of what the Harmonium actually are! This has to change now, because it is going to keep hampering our work until we deal with it. </p>

<p>Here's what I suggest (and this is the version that seems to be used most often): the phrases "Harmonium" and "Harmonium Guard" refer to Ortho's millitary, both the soldiers at home and the "faction" on the planes. Like the beurocracy and temples, they get two representatives on the Octave council (names stolen from the PDF): The Composer of Prime Harmony, who represents the soldiers on Ortho and their Prime colonies, and the Composer of Planar Harmony (maybe the Factol, maybe not), who represents the Planar branch of the millitary and their planar bases. Both branches are still Harmonium, but they are otherwise quite different. Prime Harmonium see their planar counterparts as being crude and barbaric, while Planar Harmonium see their Prime counterparts as naive clueless only fit to stand guard on Ortho or handle the minor scuffles in the colonies. So well a good deal of Ortho's populous are active or retired Harmonium, civillians have no claim to the title. Just throwing it out there. Really though, it doesn't matter which one we pick as long as we pick one definition and stick with it.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold"><br />
3.</span> We seem to have precious few defined NPCs for the setting. Once I finish looking through the PDF, I'll start from the top, find holes where we need good NPC's, write quick summaries of them, show the least to people so they can make changes, and then draw up full stats as necessary. Note that a quick Alignment/Race/Class/Level breakdown is all you really need for many NPC's -- particularly ones that the PCs aren't going to be fighting.</p>

<p>The rest of the problems I've found are pretty much things Clueless noted earlier. I'll let you know if I see anymore problems.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Generally I agree although I envisioned the government of Ortho to function as a communist state with regards to employment allocation or at the least to enforce compulsory military service so that all citizens go through the indoctrination process for a few years. Alternatively there could be a system like in "Starship Troopers" where you only become a voting citizen if you have completed a tour of military service or some other act which benefits society as a whole.</p>

<p>Apart from that your ideas look solid, I particularly like the friction between the Planar and Prime harmonies, I'd leave this a little vague so that DM's could either play this as either friendly competition or a bitter rivalry for resources and prestige. </p>

<p>I'd also suggest that if people are writing up detailed stats for NPC's they put up a post so that we don't do un-neccessary duplicates.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Widespread cumpulsory millitary service is a form of what's known as "Total War" -- the modern form of high impact warfare in which most able-bodied individuals fight, and those that don't are working to further the war effort in other ways. Total War is less than a century old (with true total mandatory enlistment being far younger) and is a product of the Industrial Revolution. In pre-industrial societies (like Ortho), most of the population is needed for farming. Pre-modern warfare was fought on the margins, only removing as many soldiers from farms as the state can afford to feed. For a state like Ortho, it would be inconcievable to remove all its able-bodied young people from their farms for any lengnth of time. Even in emergencies, they wouldn't draft more people than they had to. After all, what good is a victory when the troops are starving and the wheat is rotting in the fields? </p>

<p>So yeah, cumpulsory millitary service is a cool idea, and in a more food-rich society, it's probably what they would go for, but at this stage in Ortho's history, it's really a practical impossibillity.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

          Ortho: The To Do List        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>The discussion of Ortho and communisim has come up before and at the  time we compared and contrasted the end result as seen in Russia vs. China. I much much much prefer viewing it as the way China works - and it's included in the rough document there as a guideline for when that section gets handled. The believers of the Way of Harmony (to avoid confusing terms) are *not* above the law though they are very much powerful.</p>

<p>I know the terms need to get sorted out. I suspect there's a difference between the Knights of Harmony,  the original militaristic group, and the Harmonium, which probably includes non-offensive groups such as schools, research departments etc (think the Army Corp of Engineers). </p>

<p>The *philosophy* is open and encouraged in all and the indoctrination process doesn't so much occur within the Knights themselves as in growing up on Ortho itself - from family, church, local schools and the Schools of Ethics. For example, there's plenty of folks who say they're a communist but aren't members of the communist party, and they do truly believe the ideals. And it's that, coming from planars, that can cause the confusion in terms. You don't have to carry a card to believe. You do have to carry a card to act as military or police force or draw pay.</p>

<p>Re: terms - this is what I was going to go through and clean up references with once we had holes patched. Revisions, suggestions, requests for clarification welcome.</p>

<p>Ortho - the place<br />
Orthorian - the people or an adjective<br />
the Way of Harmony - the belief system (as an Orthorian would say)<br />
the Knights of Harmony - an old fashioned way of saying the Harmonium, or a historical reference to an establishing knighthood<br />
the Harmonium - the military branch of Ortho passing itself off as a faction<br />
the Pax Harmonium - a timeperiod or metaphorical reference to Orthorian influence<br />
the Orthorian Central Authority - the actual government, all of the branches not just military</p>

<p>re: The three pillars - as I recall my intentions there were to emphasize how those components are as much the pillars of society as they are of governance, which are two rather different things. Did I give the Lords of Law a council representative and have now simply forgotten?</p>

<p>I'm much inclined to view the Harmonium title as simply addressing that entire 'executive' branch of government. A point of subtlety that is of course confusing to Planars when they first join. The OCA has not extended it's non-military organizations to Sigil yet b/c Sigil is not properly prepared to become a colony. </p>

<p>Now that does leave the interesting question of where the loyalties lie of those planars who join but don't realize they're effectively asking to become citizens of the Prime... but I suspect that's something to leave in there as a point of conflict. Especially in light of the planar colony possibly getting restless about wanting to become a full province.</p>

<p>A note re: practicality of a total-war state - it isn't *as* impossible for Ortho given the magic in the environment and the sheer level of organization the planet could it pull off. These aren't a medieval people, if anything in mentality you're much closer to Roman (orderly, progressive, problem-solvers). Medieval just doesn't reflect this world very well at all. Pull out a couple of clerics blessing fields and casting food and water and you can see where I'm going with this. They have the capability for total war if they needed it.</p>

<p>However, I don't believe though that they would have it for *other* reasons. Namely that it's easier to believe in peace and harmony if you actually *have* some of it, so they leave the sons and daughters of the people at home if they want to stay there. (Besides, having reserve populations to dip into is always handy.) If Ortho has a major offensive though you can bet enlistment rates shoot up, and it's still one of the easier ways to really get ahead in the world to join up for at least awhile. Right now - they just don't *need* it and they haven't since the War of Iron smacked them firmly on the nose with the newspaper and said 'Bad dog! Sit!' They *are* aggressive. They are *not* stupid though, and a significant portion of the OCA have learned the lesson that more subtle approaches are called for if you truly want loyal territories.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

          Ortho: The To Do List        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Well said, Clueless. You're only mistake was in comparing Ortho to Rome. The important thing to remember is that in the Roman system, foreigners, non-citizens, and especially slaves did most of the farming which is precisely why so many of the upper-class Romans got to go off to play soldier. Also note that the Romans didn't practice anything like true Total War. I have a couple of things to add as well.</p>

<p>From what I can tell, Ortho is a socialist republic, and, as far as I know, we on Earth have never had a government quite like it. China, is kind've close, but Ortho is considerably more democratic. There's actually a lot we still need to work out about the way Ortho's government works, however. Remember, any Ortho setting we make is going to be strongly centered around politics, so we really need to make sure Ortho's government is as well defined as we can. With that in mind here's some questions I haven't seen adequately adressed.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Who controls Ortho's millitary? What checks are there on the millitary's power?</p>

<p>What is the modern state of the Knights of Harmony? Special Ops? Secret Police? Or have they been absorbed by the millitary?</p>

<p>If the Octave Council is the upper house of the legislature, who makes up the executive branch? Can the Octaves do both?</p>

<p>How much influence do the churches have over the government? Does the presence of religious leaders in the Octave make Ortho partly theocratic? What effect does this have on Octave Policy?</p>

<p>How do people get chosen for the Octave? Are they elected? Selected? By whom?</p>

<p>Are the Composers leaders over their domains, or simply representatives? Does it depend on the composer?</p>

<p>What about the council? What does it mean when it says the provinces choose "a representative of the state, church, and harmonium?" Why are the church and Harmonium involved? Which Harmonium, anyway? What are the differences between the three different types of representatives?</p>

<p>Who chooses these three representatives? Does it depend on the province?  Would the Council get upset if reprentatives weren't chosen democratically?</p>

<p>How do they keep an entrenched aristocracy from developing in the provinces and taking over the council? Is that happening? Has it happened already?</p>

<p>What about the Judicial system? The councils double as the federal appeals courts, but who makes up the local courts? How much autonomy does the council allow them? How does that effect the administration of justice? </p>

<p>How do the Orthorian courts actually work, anyway?</p>

<p>Just how much autonomy are the provinces allowed? Are there constitutional restrictions on the world government's power over them? What are they? </p>

<p>Do the provinces have their own armies? What about local police forces? How does the world government keep disobedient provinces in line?</span></p>

<p>So yeah, a lot of questions to chew on. Those that have ready answers we should get off the table now, the rest we should chew on more.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;Duckluck&#039;</em> wrote:</div>For a state like Ortho, it would be inconcievable to remove all its able-bodied young people from their farms for any lengnth of time. Even in emergencies, they wouldn't draft more people than they had to. After all, what good is a victory when the troops are starving and the wheat is rotting in the fields? </div>
While I agree with the historical examples you raise I agree with Clueless that those rules don't necessarily apply to Ortho. Regardless of this the farming year does contain a certain amount of 'down-time' in which sons and daughters could get involved in some civic projects - not necessarily military mind you but with that mindset. This would include things like road building, communal irrigation projects, research and development, admin tasks as well as direct combat and law enforcement. The council isn't stupid, they'd tailor the tasks to suit peoples abilities so that a budding mage isn't stuck in spiky red plate armour.</p>

<p>I think that this would allow us to better reflect the lawful nature of Ortho by giving everyone a taste of military discipline for a few weeks a year whilst working on a community project.</p>

<p>One other reason that I can see for giving a large number of civillians military training is that I can't see a reason for there to be a large army stationed on Ortho as there shouldn't be any inter-provence war that requires them. The only time conventional battle should be necessary on Ortho soil would be in cases of extra-planar invasion. Other 'rough work' could be performed by a local constabulary who would have the power to recruit local citizens where necessary (could be some nice plot hooks involving misuse of this power here). There might be one centralised army on the planet but I see this being more composed of 'special forces' types who act on trouble spots as needed and could become unit leaders for citizen soldiers if there ever was a major invasion.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I didn't bring up Rome as an example of how the farming industry would work (I've got a pretty solid classics background - I know better). It's more the mentality - the attitude - has aspects of the Roman personality in it. These aren't peasants hiding half-starved in a feudal society. That's a stereotype I know - but that's the comparison a *lot* of players walk into when they think a 'fantasy' world - so it's better to nip that one fast than have to argue repeatedly why running water is *not* anachronistic.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Well... let's see what I can sort out here. Some of this has already been answered or partially answered via implication.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;Duckluck&#039;</em> wrote:</div> Who controls Ortho's millitary? What checks are there on the millitary's power? </div></p>

<p>I would say that the Council and Octave probably make the major mission decisions - setting the overall goals. Leaving the details to the military. Yeah this does mean the military has an influence and vote on what it gets to do - but not enough of one they can just take off without consultation or a coup.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div> What is the modern state of the Knights of Harmony? Special Ops? Secret Police? Or have they been absorbed by the millitary? </div></p>

<p>Very good question. They may be considered the elite of the elite - like Delta force. Or they may be a secret society operating within the Harmonium in an attempt to bring their belief systems back into a rational stable construction (See the Forbidden Goddess background for that - the sole elven member of the original Knights). This is an undefined and provides major opportunity for use. But I will slaughter the person who makes them knock-off Harpers. <img src="http://23.92.31.81/planewalker.com/sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/wink.png" title="Eye-wink" alt="Eye-wink" class="smiley-content"/></p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>
If the Octave Council is the upper house of the legislature, who makes up the executive branch? Can the Octaves do both? </div>
I don't think the system would have been quite as specifically crafted as the US system is. We may need to research some of the other systems out there to find an answer to this. My inclination is to say no - we don't need a specific executive branch.  In effect the Harmonium (military) serves that purpose as is, right?</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div> How much influence do the churches have over the government? Does the presence of religious leaders in the Octave make Ortho partly theocratic? What effect does this have on Octave Policy?</div>
Separation of church and state is a new thing historically speaking and I suspect in no small part comes out of seeing the church do things not in the state's best interest and vice versa. It shouldn't be too much more of a problem than say... the Temple of Waukeen in Amn? (yeah yeah, I read FR sometimes)</p>

<p>I don't think it needs to apply in this environment. I suspect the churches have their influences fairly indirectly in terms of commanding officers and all but are definately there outside of the Octave - their clergy serve as healers on the fields, advisers, seers, communications experts, record keepers, etc etc. Thankfully the Lords of Order (Ina being an odd one though) are all on the side of the OCA, and at least one of the Lords is all in favor of this sort of orderly command system.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>How do people get chosen for the Octave? Are they elected? Selected? By whom?</div>
I was thinking the Lower house handles that process - it seems to be the best compromise of efficiency vs. representation?</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div> Are the Composers leaders over their domains, or simply representatives? Does it depend on the composer? </div>
Depends. The provinces are country sized after all. The Schools of Ethics provide a stable point for discussion of local law, world(federal) law, ethics, and philosophy - but the best governance over time is usually one where each major demographic/geographical area has a law customized to it's own mores and needs. Hence - "do your thing where you are - but lord help you if you cross Council directives or OCA regulations and laws".</p>

<p>Motmurk for example almost *certainly* has a separation of representative and a leader. The leader has to keep control of his position at home- but the representative is told 'Do this this and this - or I'll fire you and send someone else. And by fire - I mean charge with treason and have executed.'</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div> What about the council? What does it mean when it says the provinces choose "a representative of the state, church, and harmonium?" Why are the church and Harmonium involved? Which Harmonium, anyway? What are the differences between the three different types of representatives? </div>
That's one of our fuzzy points. I think I started dropping that idea later on and just outright ignored it for at least one province (the jungle one with the raksasha)... That can probably vanish, esp sine I don't think we actually had any different powers assigned between the three.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div> Who chooses these three representatives? Does it depend on the province?  Would the Council get upset if reprentatives weren't chosen democratically?</div>
Depends on the province and see above re: local controls. Some of these provinces were forged out of an alliance of equal powers that were just not willing to give up their own ways of working - compromise (and harmony) resulted. And you try telling an orc to be democratic... <img src="http://23.92.31.81/planewalker.com/sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/wink.png" title="Eye-wink" alt="Eye-wink" class="smiley-content"/> The beholders were easier!</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div> How do they keep an entrenched aristocracy from developing in the provinces and taking over the council? Is that happening? Has it happened already?</div>
It may have happened in some of them already - in fact I think there actually *is* one where it has. It's not encouraged and with membership in the military(Harmonium) open to *all* regardless of location by OCA laws - that may help dissolve the issue over time. There's a Lord of Royalty that may also get in a huff about it, nobility and rank is something you can inherit but along with it comes a great deal of responsibility and he gets cranky if you don't pull your share for the common good.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div> What about the Judicial system? The councils double as the federal appeals courts, but who makes up the local courts? How much autonomy does the council allow them? How does that effect the administration of justice? </div>
Good question. The clergy of Saeducial probably like to get tangled up in it but the Schools of Ethics are likely to point out a natural bias in such situations, and the Lord of Justice and Judges would *really* get cranky if someone tampered. Hrm. Perhaps the Schools of Ethics play a major role in this situation?</p>

<p>As for autonomy - the OCA requires laws be written down (see!? stuff just made up out of thin air!) - this is to preserve it for length of time and to avoid poor memories corrupting law. Where local aws do not conflict with OCA laws, they are in effect - otherwise OCA laws rule?</p>

Needs to get worked out.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div> Just how much autonomy are the provinces allowed? Are there constitutional restrictions on the world government's power over them? What are they?</div>
Also needs to get worked out. I suspect the founding provinces have a few subtle bylines put into their versions of 'constitutions' that provide extra security. The beholders for example would have required it.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div> Do the provinces have their own armies? What about local police forces? How does the world government keep disobedient provinces in line? </div>
Also a good question.
Historically - Pan Thaera has been a problem. The provinces there were split deliberated to force them to spend more time sorting out internal trouble than external. And well - let's not forget that elven genocide thing - truly disobedient provinces get the snot kicked out of em. Nowadays - possibly economic repercussions and enticements are tried first?</p>

Hopefully that's filled in some blanks.

         <p>OK, I'm clearing away the ones that have good answers so we can focus on the tricky ones. This may look a bit messy.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;Duckluck&#039;</em> wrote:</div> Who controls Ortho's millitary? What checks are there on the millitary's power? </div></p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;Clueless&#039;</em> wrote:</div>I would say that the Council and Octave probably make the major mission decisions - setting the overall goals. Leaving the details to the military. Yeah this does mean the military has an influence and vote on what it gets to do - but not enough of one they can just take off without consultation or a coup.</div></p>

<p>What about the generals and millitary bureaucrats under them? If we take the Factol as being the Composer of Planar Harmony, then we basically know about the about that part of the millitary. But what about the Prime branch? Is the Composer of Prime Harmony the leader of Ortho's armies (an extremely powerful position to be in)? Probably, but who are his subordinates? Generals and admirals, probably, but how much autonomy do they have? And who is their loyalty to?</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div> What is the modern state of the Knights of Harmony? Special Ops? Secret Police? Or have they been absorbed by the millitary? </div></p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Very good question. They may be considered the elite of the elite - like Delta force. Or they may be a secret society operating within the Harmonium in an attempt to bring their belief systems back into a rational stable construction (See the Forbidden Goddess background for that - the sole elven member of the original Knights). This is an undefined and provides major opportunity for use. But I will slaughter the person who makes them knock-off Harpers. <img src="http://23.92.31.81/planewalker.com/sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/wink.png" title="Eye-wink" alt="Eye-wink" class="smiley-content"/></div></p>

<p>I know! Let's make them be an elite fraternity of adventurers and spies that trancends national boundaries and works to promote an agenda of peace... joking. I say, the Knights of Harmony should be an elite force of spies, bodygaurds, and agents directly loyal to the Octaves. Kind've like the U.S. Secret Service or Roman Praetorian Guard. Basically they are there to protect councilors and serve as agents in the provinces. They also neatly prevent any attempted millitary coups. Oh, and it would be easy to tie in PCs as having been current or former members of the group.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>
If the Octave Council is the upper house of the legislature, who makes up the executive branch? Can the Octaves do both? </div></p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>I don't think the system would have been quite as specifically crafted as the US system is. We may need to research some of the other systems out there to find an answer to this. My inclination is to say no - we don't need a specific executive branch.  In effect the Harmonium (military) serves that purpose as is, right?</div></p>

<p>It's a lot like the Roman republic. It doesn't have a specific executive branch, so the upper echelons of the legislature condense into one. Actually, the Octave Council really is a combined Judicial, Executive, and Legislative branch, in that they make, enforce, and defend the laws -- which makes them extremely powerful.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Church issue: resolved.</p>

<p>Octave appointment: resolved!</span></p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div> Are the Composers leaders over their domains, or simply representatives? Does it depend on the composer? </div>
<div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Depends. The provinces are country sized after all. The Schools of Ethics provide a stable point for discussion of local law, world(federal) law, ethics, and philosophy - but the best governance over time is usually one where each major demographic/geographical area has a law customized to it's own mores and needs. Hence - "do your thing where you are - but lord help you if you cross Council directives or OCA regulations and laws".</p>

<p>Motmurk for example almost *certainly* has a separation of representative and a leader. The leader has to keep control of his position at home- but the representative is told 'Do this this and this - or I'll fire you and send someone else. And by fire - I mean charge with treason and have executed.'</div></p>

<p>Actually, I was asking about the Octaves and their various roles. IE <span style="font-weight:bold">is the Composer of Magic also the highest ranked mage? Or is he the person chosen to represent the highest ranked mage</span>? Your response raises interesting quetions of its own, however. For instance, <span style="font-weight:bold">What happens when a Provincial lord gets so powerful he or she becomes a threat? How much power are the OCA really willing to cede to the Provinces?</span></p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div> What about the council? What does it mean when it says the provinces choose "a representative of the state, church, and harmonium?" Why are the church and Harmonium involved? Which Harmonium, anyway? What are the differences between the three different types of representatives? </div>
<div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>That's one of our fuzzy points. I think I started dropping that idea later on and just outright ignored it for at least one province (the jungle one with the raksasha)... That can probably vanish, esp sine I don't think we actually had any different powers assigned between the three.</div></p>

<p>Yeah, besides, the way they are divided doesn't match their role. The military (Harmonium) is Federally controlled, so there's no reason for the provinces to send millitary representatives to be councilors as it would effectively serve to cede some of their power to the Central government. Likewise, with the churches. The provincial authorities want councilors that represent their interests, not the gods'.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold"><br />
Let's just say that how councilors are chosen will be determined on a province by province basis.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Aristocratic problem: addressed and tabled.</span></p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div> What about the Judicial system? The councils double as the federal appeals courts, but who makes up the local courts? How much autonomy does the council allow them? How does that effect the administration of justice? </div>
<div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Good question. The clergy of Saeducial probably like to get tangled up in it but the Schools of Ethics are likely to point out a natural bias in such situations, and the Lord of Justice and Judges would *really* get cranky if someone tampered. Hrm. Perhaps the Schools of Ethics play a major role in this situation?</div></p>

<p>Perhaps the judges are drawn from the Clergy while the layers, arbiters, notaries and what have you come from the Ethics schools. Some courts will also have a jury in there somewhere to reduce corruption.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">The Provincial courts are free to use whatever laws they want so long as they don't contradict the OCA laws</span></p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div> How do the Orthorian courts actually work, anyway? </div>
<div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Needs to get worked out.</div>
Perhaps they have a clergyman judge, Ethicists to serve as lawyers, and in some cases a jury of peers, with the actual minutia of the process differing from province to province.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">The amount of control the federal government is allowed varies from province to province. </span></p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div> Do the provinces have their own armies? What about local police forces? How does the world government keep disobedient provinces in line? </div>

<p>I'd say they don't have their own armies and aside from local police forces, must depend on Federal troops for defence. Therefore, in order to challenge the OCA, a province first needs to have some serious friends in the millitary or else any uprising will be crushed in days. Of course, the whole point of the Path of Harmony is to not have to do things like that so they'll always start with the diplomatic options.</p>

In some places it lists the three pillars of society as being: the Government, the Church, and the Harmonium, but in other places it says nearly everyone on Ortho is a member of the Harmonium Faction, and in still other places it says that the Harmonium doesn't really exist on Ortho in the strict sense and instead what cagers see as the Harmonium Faction are simply trappings the Orthan explorers took on so they'd blend with the other factions.</div></p>

<p>In regard to that, does anyone think Sarin (and now Faith) was the guy in charge of Ortho's entire military? If so, Sigil seems a strange place for him (that is, Sarin) to reside. It seems to me that Sarin's position (and now Faith's) must have been the governor of Ortho's planar colonies. It's easier to believe that the githzerai Omar (who became factol of the Harmonium a while back, before he exposed himself as an Anarchist) would get the job of territorial governor than it is to believe he was given the reins of one of the three major arms of the state.</p>

<p>The word "Harmonium" could still be used on Ortho to refer to the military, but in that case the factol probably shouldn't be the head of the Harmonium - only a high-ranking member of it put in charge of an important colony.</p>

<p>There's a bit of this already in the PDF (and I recognize my writing style), but this isn't made explicit - there's just the argument that Sarin didn't rule Ortho, but nothing really about what his actual position was.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>So Sigil <span style="font-style:italic">was</span> a promotion, but not the only one - or the easiest - he could have had. Yeah, it seems pretty clear that since someone was available to promote him, there are further ranks above him.

         <p>Sounds to me like the Harmonium Factol is "chief of planar expeditionary forces" - the kind of force that goes out to found/pacify new realms for the cause.

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>I've been working under the assumtion that the Factol, and the Composer of Planar Harmony were one and the same (my write-up on Ortho's government even explicately refers to Faith as being the last Octave). In my mind, the Harmonium is just the military, but on the Planes, the military happens to control everything, and the line between soldier and civilian is blurred. Therefore, I see Faith as being both the comander of the Planar branch of the military (what PS calls the Harmonium), and functionally the governor of the Planar colonies as well (although they could have an official governor or representative as well. One of the Factors, maybe). </p>

<p>As for Sarin choosing the more difficult position, does it directly state that that postion was Factol? Assuming it does, then that could mean he would have had an easier time becoming Composer of Prime Harmony, but that's a bit of a stretch. It could also be that you can be Factol without being Composer of Planar Harmony, and the Planar Harmonium will frequently choose to seperate the two positions so that the Factol will secretly be serving a composer who is even higher up. It could even be (although this would be stretching canon) that Faith has been the Composer of Planar Harmony all along, and she just happens to be filling both roles while she looks for a suitable replacement for her husband.</p>

<p>And Rip's right, Omar becoming a member of the Octave makes absolutely no sense, which leaves me in a bit of a bind in terms of the positions' actual roles.</p>

<p>Edit: I figured out how to make the Omar thing work. Perhaps he was never really Factol to begin with. Take a look:<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold"><br />
The True Story of Omar: the Factol Who Never Was.</span></p>

<p>In years past, a talented Githzerai named Omar rose swiftly through the ranks of the Harmonium before eventually becoming Factol, but to the shock of those beneath him, upon attaining the vaunted position, he revealed himself to be an Anarchist in disguise and announced the dissolution of the faction. Despite Omar's swift fall from power and the Harmonium's insistance that they had known he was a fake all along, most planars see the incident as evidence that the Harmonium is not so infalliable as they claim to be. The Harmonium leadership, on the other hand, see the incident as evidence that most Planars are morons.</p>

<p>In actuality, the rise of "Factol" Omar really was all part of an elaborate Harmonium sting operation launched by the OCA as a way to "clean house" in the Planar Harmonium Firstly, it was a way to ferret out Revolutionary League spies within the Planar Harmonium. And secondly, it was a way for the Orthorian leadership to test the loyalty of their planar followers by seeing who they would side with in a mock civil war.</p>

<p>Omar, for his part, was the perfect tool. His true nature was apparent early on, and all through his rise to power he was watched by a group of of shadowy investigators (many of them Sin Hunters sent from Ortho) who saw who the man dealt with and took down names. Then one day, Omar was approached by the Planar Harmonium and told he was the new Factol. The OCA officials overseeing the investigation were worried that Omar wouldn't believe he had truly been made Factol until he had spoken with officials on Ortho, but Omar shared no such reservations, proving just how ignorant of Harmonium policy he really was. Once Omar had come to power and made his fatefull declaration, the Harmonium waited to see what spies and traitors would come out of the woodwork to support him. Once they had a substantial list of names, they swooped in and swept Omar from a position that he had never actually held in the first place. Then they began the most fruitfull corruption investigation in the history of the Planar Harmonium. The fact that, to this day, planars still consider this great success to have been a Harmonium failure is proof that the Orthorians have kept their secrets well</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>There does seem to be some contradictions in the PDF on that front. One part says that "composer" is equivalent to a five-star general, while elsewhere we've given that title to every member of the Octave. Perhaps those should be renamed.</p>

         <p>(Read the thing I added to my last post about Omar, I editted it as you posted, so you may have missed it)</p>

<p>Firstly, I still think we should have a Composer of Planar Harmony as part of the Octave, even if that isn't the Factol. Of course, if the Factol (who is a Composer) isn't a member of the Octave, than we need to give the Octave diferent titles. Perhaps instead of being "Composers" they are "Directors" or "Conductors" it would fit the theme, at any rate. </p>

<p>We also have another thing to figure out. If Faith isn't a member of the Octave, who is the Composer/Director/Conductor of Planar Harmony? What is hte relationship between the two?</p>

<p>To be honest, I like the idea of keeping Faith on the Octave, even if her actual position is strictly military, but that could be because I just posted a rather long write-up on the Octave that centers around Faith, and I'd rather not have to re-write that.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;Duckluck&#039;</em> wrote:</div>(Read the thing I added to my last post about Omar, I editted it as you posted, so you may have missed it)</div></p>

<p>I did miss it. It's an good theory, and it makes a great deal of sense, but I'd very much like it not to be stated anywhere as fact. It'd be a great shame to state outright that a clever Anarchist couldn't hope to accomplish something like that - that's the whole point of the Anarchist faction, after all, which ought to be as formidable as the Harmonium when all is said and done. </p>

<p>I also quite like Omar, and wish him well. Sure, he <span style="font-style:italic">could</span> have been a mere patsy, but I'd rather give him some credit for being more competent than that. I don't see him becoming part of the Octave, but earning authority over the Harmonium's planar operations? With enough time and show of loyalty, and people in the Harmonium wanting to show off their diversity to the dubious inhabitants of Sigil (sick of seeing Primes always in charge of the faction, and from the same provincial prime world, too!) - yeah, I think it absolutely could have happened.</p>

<p>I don't see Faith joining the Octave either. Her qualifications for becoming factol - the support and love of the Harmonium officers on the planes - are thinner even than Omar's were. By Orthorian rules, the job should have gone to Tonat Shar or Killeen Caine, who were next in rank. Omar, at least, earned his way up the ranks fairly. Faith wasn't even part of the military - she was part of the church. She got the job of factol because she was someone's wife,</p>

<p>If Omar was a patsy, Faith probably is, too, if the Octave even acknowledges her position at all. The rules (as we have them now in the PDF) allow colonies to establish their own forms of government, subject to the greater authority of the central Orthorian government, and that's probably enough to allow Faith to squeak in as a territorial governor - but as a military leader? That sounds improbable. If Ortho allows such a thing to happen, it's a sign they're absolutely terrified of the independence their planar troops are showing, and are doing whatever they can to keep them from rebelling.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Which, actually, would be a pretty interesting angle to work on.

         <p>I look forward to seeing what the new PDF looks like and what the revised "To Do" list currently is.  Also, I appreciate everyone taking the time out to explain all these facts and factors to me. FYI, do we have a date for when we'll be releasing the revised PDF?  I think that it's almost getting close to finishing time.</p>

<p>If no one has any objections to me doing up these, I'd like to also do the following projects in the future.</p>

<p>The Chaos Goddess of Disease<br />
The Chaos God of Murder<br />
The Isles of Thaera<br />
The Orthi (Half-Goblins) MM write-up<br />
The Hobgoblins of Ortho write up</p>

<p>I think that will almost cover most everything that's needed to be done.  Note, I accent the "Most Everything" aspect.  I'm open for hearing more elements that need to be expanded from everyone else as I consider my primary role to help fill in gaps.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>So, how goes the making the updated PDF, Clueless?</p>

<p>But yes, my next 3 Projects are...</p>

<p>Finishing The Lord of Dance, doing the Lords of Chaos' Realm, and I'd be happy to do a Sin-Hunter prestige class.</p>

<p>At some point, I'll modify the Alzirus entry to be a Elemental Being rather than an Efreeti.  I'll also make it more clear that the Otaki mostly only common in Thaera and have wandered from there.</p>

<p>anything else?</p>

<p>I honestly think we're pretty close to being done here with the "material we need."  Frankly, I think we should make a serious thought to whether we should make a second book after this to hold all the extra-material we have.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Keep in mind, we're making not so much a book as a PDF or collection of PDFs. Right now, we've got enough content. How much we've got exactly, I'm not sure. A lot of stuff in the PDF is totally redundant or unnecessary and can be cut, and a lot of the cool stuff we've come up with here still hasn't received a proper write-up as such (like the thing I wrote on the history of the OCA in some thread somewhere and seem to have misplaced). Still I'd estimate the stuff we've done as being about three to four hundred pages of varying quality. We've probably got about 50 pages of chaff to cut, and at least as much will be stuck in naturally to fill in holes. So yeah, I know it seems like we've got a lot of stuff here, and we do, but I can't see it getting much above 400 pages, which is about right for a setting book. If we hit the 500 page mark and don't have anything we are comfortable cutting, we can talk about a spin off. I doubt that will happen though, so we probably shouldn't worry too much about it.</p>

<p>As for what we should do after we finish the PDF, I was thinking we could release adventure modules every now and then to move the meta-plot forward (I was thinking of doing something with the contest to be the Conductor of Planar Harmony). We could also do more detailed releases for things we've only touched briefly on in this book. Things that could, potentially, be spun off into their own books include:</p>

<p>*<span style="font-style:italic">The Prime Colonies</span><br />
These have so much room to expand. Meter alone could probably top 100 pages.</p>

<p>*<span style="font-style:italic">The Provinces</span><br />
I know Heka-Voll is an ancient kingdom and the seat of the Harmonium, but what kind of food do they serve? Do they like it spicy? Is there anything they won't eat? So many unanswered questions!</p>

<p>*<span style="font-style:italic">Religion</span><br />
It's fine to say Orthorians mostly worship the Lords of Order, but you can't tell me they don't have different traditions. Perhaps we should take the time to explain what those are.</p>

<p>*<span style="font-style:italic">The Races</span><br />
Ten pages isn't enough to describe an ethnic group in the real world, why should it be sufficient for describing whole <span style="font-style:italic">species</span> in fantasy? </p>

<p>*<span style="font-style:italic">Arcadia and Nemausus</span><br />
Yes I know it's stepping on Planescape's toes, but there's a Harmonium-caused crisis going on in the Outer Planes and anyone playing on Ortho deserves to know about it. This has a much higher risk of stepping on canon than other Ortho projects, so we'd need to a have some canny bloods on board before we did this.</p>

<p>I think that about covers the obvious stuff. I'm sure we can come up with some fun projects that aren't on this list though.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>At last count I eyeballed it around 300 to 400, I'm sure there's additional stuff added by now. Honestly - what we're missing though are stats for things: classes, feats, NPC stats, the usual things that come with a setting book. We have lots of informational meat, and not much of a skeleton to mount it on for play with your average DM. Average DM's not having either the inspiration, time or energy to make up their own numbers as they're already busy juggling their own plots and PCs.</p>

<p>We could also use an intro one-shot adventure, aimed at newer players, newer PCs. And given that it's Ortho the intro one-shot also needs to buck the "We're so evil it hurts, not a good-cop to be found for miles" stereotype from Planescape, in order to introduce the essentially conflicted nature of the planet.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">
