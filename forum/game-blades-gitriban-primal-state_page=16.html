         <p><span style="font-size:9px"><span style="font-weight:bold">[sorry wei, and Ben, splitting the action didn't work as well as I hoped, so let's bring it back.  Az, Dun, I hate to railroad you guys, but, in interest of moving on ...</p>

<p>Edit, notice Grazz never replied to any mention of Vivec, ignoring the name completely.  Tri, it's up to you how Rey's going to react, smart=run away, fun=follow 'em upstairs.]</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color:orange">"Oh, sure, why should I try to stop loosing blood?"</span>  Grazz removes the ring at Ar'dru's request, nonetheless.  He tosses it towards Du'minh.  <span style="color:orange"><span style="font-weight:bold">"This is for you, Rish.  I got it from a cutter named Gim-Raan.  You'd hate him, thought his life was more valuable to his people than his honor."</span></span></p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;Dunamin&#039;</em> wrote:</div>
“Step outside and we will escort you to where this conversation may be held in more private and controlled environs… and we will find out where we all stand.</div></p>

<p><span style="color:orange"><span style="font-weight:bold">"I'd rather my corpse be found sooner instead of later, thank you.  Besides, if I do survive I'd like to drink here again, and I can only assume the rest of you lot are still upstairs having some trouble with the management, otherwise I'd've been shot in the back again by now.  So you'll follow me, cutters."</span></span></p>

<p>Without waiting for a reply, Grazz turns and starts back up the stairs.  He retrieves his dagger, but then holds his hands above his head, the dagger held in his left.  The pirates at the base of the stairs glower but part to let him pass.</p>

<p>Obsidian Orb quickly communicates some instructions to her tribe using some cryptic hand signals.  She picks up, ironicly, the smallest, nearly-leafless plant <span style="font-size:9px"><span style="font-weight:bold">[the one that ash-robes was carrying]</span></span> and steps in beside Du'minh and Ar'dru. <span style="color:indigo"> <span style="font-weight:bold">"Is my aid worthless, Yanki?"</span> </span>She demands,  <span style="color:indigo"><span style="font-weight:bold">"For my boon I would hear what this gith has to say.  I desire to know much about the Great War, for the gith of Athas have forgotten the Great Gith, and the Enemy, except in vague legends.  It was the search for knowledge that made me what I am, and brought me to Sigil.  Obsidian Orb will accompany you as an ally, or shall This Now end and Next Now begin?"</span></span></p>

<p>***</p>

<p>Grazz climbs the stairs.  The first pirate he encounters at the top is loading a pistol.  Grazz swiftly snatches it from him and smacks him on the forehead with the butt.  <span style="color:orange">"<span style="font-weight:bold">None of that, Finn me'lad.  Action's over, go back to yer rum." </span> </span>He pushes past the other pirates <span style="font-size:9px"><span style="font-weight:bold">[total of 5 up here + bartender]</span></span></p>

<p>When the bartender catches sight of Grazz, he yells, ignoring the blade at his throat. <span style="color:green"> <span style="font-weight:bold">"Hey!  You scum sucking scallywag!  Bosun'll have your gizzard this time, Grazz!"</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color:orange"><span style="font-weight:bold">"Feh!  I know yer old man better than you do, pup!  I've been banned six times, but my jink always brings fair weather outa 'im.  Besides, I might not be done destroyin' stuff yet.  Git back to yer bar 'till I'm ready to settle up."</span> </span> He then hands the pistol to another (slightly bewildered) pirate and kneels, using his dagger to scrape his tanglefooted boot from the hallway floor.</p>

<p>Jhank'kor and Daraz see Ar'dru and Du'minh close behind Grazz, weapons at the ready.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Jhank'kor's eyes flare with malice at Grazz's return. You can hear the knuckles of his right hand snap at the warlock balls his fist in an attempt to withhold the welling fury and siren song of eldritch power. Shrugging off the temptation, he glowers and says in a deathly calm, <span style="font-weight:bold"><span style="color:red">"Did this bastard child of Zerth get in your heads, warriors? Or are you returning to make this a full warband execution?"</span></span></p>

<p>The sudden tug on his arm sends him a bit off-balance, but the warmage scrambles upright with the aid of his staff. Whirling to glare into Vivec's face, the mage snaps his hand to Vivec's throat, theurgy hammering in his veins. His grips tightens for half a moment but then drops his arm to his side. His sullen eyes glance to Gy-nath before boring into Vivec again. <span style="font-weight:bold"><span style="color:red">"I do not care who you are, dog of a Zerai. I'd rather find a drunk priest of Pelor before I allowed your filthy hands to heal me."</span></span> The mage raises his voice for the rest to hear as he steps back a pace or two nearer to Gy-Nath. <span style="font-weight:bold"><span style="color:red">"Any <span style="font-style:italic">true</span> son of Gith here who can tend wounds?</span></span></p>

<p>As an afterthought, the warlock adds toward the bartender with a point of his chin to Vivec, <span style="font-weight:bold"><span style="color:red">"Oh, here's the man you're looking for."</span></span></p>

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;Benyamin&#039;</em> wrote:</div> <span style="font-weight:bold"><span style="color:red">"I do not care who you are, dog of a Zerai. I'd rather find a drunk priest of Pelor before I allowed your filthy hands to heal me."</span></span> The mage raises his voice for the rest to hear as he steps back a pace or two nearer to Gy-Nath. <span style="font-weight:bold"><span style="color:red">"Any <span style="font-style:italic">true</span> son of Gith here who can tend wounds?</span></span>
</div></p>

<p>“Doubtful,” a feminine voice replies from further down the water-damaged hallway.  “There’s a daughter of Gith here who might, though.  What is it <span style="font-style:italic">this</span> time?”</p>

<p>One of the doors has opened along the hallway – one of those leading to the private rooms.of the Haven Port Inn.  The figure turns, clearly examining the devastation up and down the corridor.</p>

<p>The speaker’s build is not that of the legendary female warriors of the Githyanki:  not one to gleefully cleave anyone in half with a greatsword.  Rather, this one has the look of either a mage or a psion, to judge from the absence of armor, or the staff, shod with Astral steel, that she leans slightly upon.</p>

<p>But the real kicker is the third eye in the center of her forehead.</p>

<p>A psion, then.  Onyx in color, complementing the color of her natural eyes, the gem isn’t actually attached by a cord or any other visible means.  If one can get past the third-eye thing, one might notice other details.  Long black hair has been elaborately braided and beaded, and multiple earrings hang from the serrated ears.  Like most githyanki, she favors bright, strong colors in her dress.</p>

<p>As githyanki tend to go <span style="font-style:italic">everywhere</span> armed to the teeth, this one also has an ornate dagger sheathed at her belt, as well as a light crossbow and a pair of bolt cases among her effects. </p>

<p>The woman takes her time looking at the various persons present.  Hmm.  One large, confident warrior with a recently bloodied weapon.  One duthka’gith.  A badly wounded githzerai.  It wasn’t so unusual that he was wounded; given the apparent bloodshed, it was only unusual that he was alive.  One with a bandaged wrist, who had spoken.  An Athasian gith.  And one familiar figure.</p>

<p>“Kith’rak.”  Spotting Gy-Nath, Ya’shenn bows with <span style="font-style:italic">precisely</span> the correct amount of politeness.  Assuming, or simply pretending to assume – for the sake of his dignity – that the captain is actually in control of the situation.  Her voice had been somewhat sarcastic before, when first opening the door; it is quite polite now.  “Perhaps my assistance would be of some help to you?”</p>

<p>One might quickly notice that the female githyanki speaks an extremely ‘pure’ form of the language -- without accent, well enunciated, but also containing some archaic words that aren’t in widespread use these days.  For those who have heard it before, it’s a perfect match for the ‘accent’ of the inhabitants of Tu’narath.</p>

<p>OOC:  Hello there.  <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/smile.png" title="Smiling" alt="Smiling" class="smiley-content"/>  <br />
Azure, I’m assuming that she knows Gy is a kith’rak – if not, simply assume that she knows him by name.  <br />
Also, need to know if Jhank’s glyph is visible right now and if she’d recognize it or not.  (If it’s a psonic seal, it’s likely; if it’s magical in nature, probably not.)</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;Benyamin&#039;</em> wrote:</div>Ooooooo.....*slams evil PC into closet and presses hard against the door* What I'd love to do upon the words, "I am Jhank'kor, your killer..." :twisted:[/]</p>

<p>Jhank'kor's eyes flare with malice at Grazz's return. You can hear the knuckles of his right hand snap at the warlock balls his fist in an attempt to withhold the welling fury and siren song of eldritch power. Shrugging off the temptation, he glowers and says in a deathly calm, <span style="font-weight:bold"><span style="color:red">"Did this bastard child of Zerth get in your heads, warriors? Or are you returning to make this a full warband execution?"</span></span></p>

<p>The sudden tug on his arm sends him a bit off-balance, but the warmage scrambles upright with the aid of his staff. Whirling to glare into Vivec's face, the mage snaps his hand to Vivec's throat, theurgy hammering in his veins. His grips tightens for half a moment but then drops his arm to his side. His sullen eyes glance to Gy-nath before boring into Vivec again. <span style="font-weight:bold"><span style="color:red">"I do not care who you are, dog of a Zerai. I'd rather find a drunk priest of Pelor before I allowed your filthy hands to heal me."</span></span> The mage raises his voice for the rest to hear as he steps back a pace or two nearer to Gy-Nath. <span style="font-weight:bold"><span style="color:red">"Any <span style="font-style:italic">true</span> son of Gith here who can tend wounds?</span></span></p>

<p>As an afterthought, the warlock adds toward the bartender with a point of his chin to Vivec, <span style="font-weight:bold"><span style="color:red">"Oh, here's the man you're looking for."</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:9px">Intimidate: 28</span></div></p>

<p><span style="color:olive"><span style="font-weight:bold">ZERAI?? YOU DARE TARNISH MY NAME? <br />
</span></span><br />
He pauses, then his voice lowers to a dangerous calm.<br />
<span style="color:olive"><span style="font-weight:bold"><br />
Were you not a son of Gith, I would strike you down here and now for your blasphemous tirade...Calm yourself -your capriciousness makes me question YOUR motives. Your hot head seems to fit the paradigm for a Zerai dog.</span></span></p>

<p>Turning to the others:<br />
<span style="color:olive"><span style="font-weight:bold"><br />
The head was alive...well, actually it wasn't dead. A dead mind's knowledge is only limited to what it knew did during life. The ghaik knew Grazz was in the adjacent room at that moment... it then... it then consumed me. I was aware of my actions - but I had no power over them. It was as if I were a passive observer to my own self.</span></span></p>

<p>His head falls down in shame.</p>

<p><span style="color:olive"><span style="font-weight:bold">I know that time is the only medicine, that will heal the lack of trust that all of you understandably have. Nevertheless, we must retrieve the head and destroy it lest it cause more damage.</span><br />
</span></p>

<p>Rey looks up, slightly surprised at the new arrival.</p>

<p><span style="font-size:9px"><br />
OOC: Will (vs Intimidate) = 26 (Azure, it's your call- either I can take back all what Rey just said, or you could compensate in another way- perhaps by detracting from my Bluff/Diplo mods)</p>

<p>Bluff (I'm NOT a zerai ; the head did it)): 28 (almost a nat 20!! yay... almost...)<br />
Diplo (Calm Down J, and Everyone else hear me out): 20'</p>

<p>Sense Motive (new character): 18 (accidentally rolled twice)- </p>

         <p>The mage hunter looks the new arrival carefully over, scanning potential magical emanations and keeping vigilant as always. He turns to Gy-Nath with a quizzical look on his face, judging by the fellow warrior’s reaction if the three-eyed gith is an acquaintance of his.</p>

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Belatedly, Ya’shenn matches the githzerai’s face to the description and reputation.  The <span style="font-style:italic">Accursed One</span>.  Definitely not someone high on the list of persons she would particularly want to speak to, or have dealings with.  Dangerous, resourceful, and utterly without morals of any kind – if his reputation held true.  The woman's gaze fixes on him for a long moment.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">To this day</span>, she thinks to herself, <span style="font-style:italic">I can’t so much as cross the street without being asked to interrogate someone</span>.  Generally, she is not partial to using her abilities in that way, yet the demand for it never seems to decrease.  Many Githyanki would happily line up to inflict elaborate tortures on the likes of Grazz, but Ya’shenn had little stomach for such entertainments these days.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;Dunamin&#039;</em> wrote:</div>“There is no doubt that ghaik tricks were at work in relation to our business, so I will hear the necromancer’s story before more blood is shed. But this hallway is no place to do so, and we have more urgent words to exchange with the established Zerth here.” </div></p>

<p><span style="color:darkblue">“I could have sworn I’d heard someone ask for a healer,” </span>the psion states mildly. <span style="color:darkblue">“I wasn’t expecting the Accursed One to make an appearance.  <span style="font-style:italic">Kith’rak</span>, I understand the need to speak of matters like this in a more private place, but an explanation of the situation would be helpful.” </span> Massive, massive understatement. </p>

<p>To the Rish-i-Chal, the woman herself does not have the aura of a spellcaster.  To his auravision, the quarterstaff and dagger both possess a magical aura, as do two of her rings.  The gem on her forehead, conspicuously, does not.  Three items inside a pouch at her belt have some magic to them:  two vials that are probably potions, and oddly enough, a comb.  Inside one pocket a small, cylindrical object glows faintly, though this last has the general shape of the magical light-sources that one may purchase anywhere.</p>

<p>OOC:  To those in the party who would have kept up with this sort of thing, they would know that Gy-Nath is referring to the ‘Order of the Double-Edged Mind.’  It’s an old, established order of psions whose members focus on the disciplines of telepathy and clairsentience.  They are particularly known as specialists in weeding out Illithid influence and Illithid spies from Githyanki society, for their understanding of the Enemy from a mental and psionic perspective, and they have been known for training githyanki of other castes in the finer arts of illithid slaying.  Additionally, a few of their members have been specifically trained as psionic inquisitors (who are rather more feared and disliked by the average githyanki than typical members of the Order).  While the members of this Order were never numerous, their numbers have suffered considerably as a result of the Void Bombs.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Alas, had Ya’shenn known that Grazz was leading this group into the same room the Accursed himself had been in earlier, spying on the others, she would have been especially concerned.  Perhaps the Accursed is leading them all into a trap or an ambush; perhaps the githzerai has a handy escape route there.  The woman does <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> know these things, however, so she’s not more than ordinarily cautious.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;Benyamin&#039;</em> wrote:</div>Casting a wary glance at the Zerai and his stooge, the warlock fixes his gaze to the newcomer. He nods and affirms Gy's statement.Aye, I called for one--someone needs to tend to Daraz...bloody lad took a blast of flame pretty badly." Here he glares further at Vivec before taking Gy's initiative and entering the room.</div></p>

<p>The psion glances at the warlock’s bandaged wrist as he speaks.  “Perhaps we can do something about that wrist later."  By now, she’s assuming that this group subdued the Accursed – hence the destruction and the injuries.  Why was he still unbound and armed, though?  </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;Azure&#039;</em> wrote:</div>The Accursed catches sight of the ulitharid head, rather singed, lying on the floor. "Hey there, old buddy. Never looked better." He then spits on it and smiles in self-satisfaction.</div></p>

<p>Ya'shenn had just nodded politely to Daraz and taken a step toward him, her two natural eyes narrowing as she visually inspects his injuries, though she doesn’t actually touch him just yet.  <span style="font-style:italic">Ugh, burn wounds!  Another drunken knifing between pirates would’ve been far preferable. </span> </p>

<p>The psion’s attention is drawn away sharply, however, at the sight of the severed ulitharid head.  Her tone of voice has changed, as well – it’s not particularly menacing, but it has a certain edge to it, not the way she's been speaking to brother Githyanki.</p>

<p> <span style="color:darkblue">“Friend of yours, Accursed One?”</span></p>

<p>OOC:  Azure, a Psicraft, Knowledge (Psionics), other knowledge, or Int check would be nice here.  Since she heard Vivec claim to be possessed by a <span style="font-style:italic">ghaik</span> head,  I’m wondering if there’s anything Ya’shenn would know that would suggest that a severed, apparently dead Ulitharid head would be any more dangerous than an oddly-shaped volleyball.  She’s also looking directly at it (cue scary music).</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>OOC:  Azure, a Psicraft, Knowledge (Psionics), other knowledge, or Int check would be nice here.  Since she heard Vivec claim to be possessed by a <span style="font-style:italic">ghaik</span> head,  I’m wondering if there’s anything Ya’shenn would know that would suggest that a severed, apparently dead Ulitharid head would be any more dangerous than an oddly-shaped volleyball.  She’s also looking directly at it (cue scary music).</div></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">[DM - To all apperarances, the head looks cold, dead, and slightly burned.  The only unusual feature is that is has three eyes, made of crystal.]</span></p>

<p>Grazz removes a silver and white crystal amulet, setting it on the floor in the corner next to a pair of shortswords. <span style="font-weight:bold"><span style="color:orange"> "Very close aquaintance," </span></span>he replies to Ya'shenn, <span style="color:orange"><span style="font-weight:bold">"And that was my amulet of mind shielding, so call me a liar, psion." </span></span></p>

<p><span style="color:orange"><span style="font-weight:bold"> "Well, Yankis, and assorted guests," </span></span>he nods to Obsidian Orb as she enters after him,<span style="color:orange"> <span style="font-weight:bold">"Gather 'round and hear the tale of Grazz the Accursed.  You have the unique honor of being the first to hear the true story.  The rumors you've heard, pure screed.  Well, mostly screed.  Heh.  'The Accursed' isn't just a title.  I AM cursed."</p>

<p>"It's important for you to know where I got my information, so I'll start at the beginning, sort of.  See, I wasn't kidding when I said I wasn't a 'zerai, just a Hiver.  Fact is, I don't know if my parents were githzerai, githyanki, gith pirate, or some combination, I never met the bubbers.  For most of my life I couldn't have given a shit, either.  I was just a typical knight of the post.  I made good take as a petty gambler, cuz I've always had a really good eye for detail.  Well, I was really drunk one night and I made a sucker's bet,"  </span></span>He shakes his head,<span style="color:orange"> <span style="font-weight:bold">"With a Proxy."</span> </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold"><span style="color:orange">"You ever win a wish, word it right.  I was the addle-cove who said 'I wish my eyes could see everything Sight's can.'  Feh!  Berk.  Almost checked into the Gatehouse next morning when the 'tharid woke up and had breakfast."</span></span>  He visibly shutters.</p>

<p><span style="color:orange"><span style="font-weight:bold">"Well, I kept it together, at least enough to know that I was a snack-cake if the 'lithids ever found out.  Talk about a security breach, right?  Of course, it wasn't like I was going to read lips, but like I said, I've got a knack for detail.  It took me a few weeks to learn how to function again and see what was in front of ME.  Over the years, the link got stronger.  Heck, several months ago I started to get a downright empathic link that's been fading in and out."</span> </span> He starts shaking again, but with a well-practiced deep breath, masters his nerves once again.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold"><span style="color:orange">"So, now you know.  Even though, once catapulted into the shadow game, ninty percent of my knowledge came the old fashion way, the best intel came from the big guy himself.  Well, that well's dried up now.  Or so I thought, hoped, when you cutters wrote him into the dead book, which I felt most of, by the way, so thank you for the interesting and varied types of pain, warlock.  The acid was MY favorite, I missed it when the fireball hit."</p>

<p>"Well, you didn't quite give Sight the rope, yet.  When Vivec woke him up, it was quite a shock, let me tell you. Most surprizing part of it for me is, I always thought the ghaik were souless abominations, hence why the slime are so eager to join with an elder brain.  Sight's still there, though, somehow, in the eyes.  Each one is different.  One's clairvoyant, one sees the future, and one controls what others see.  Really powerful too.  Sight was the representative for the spellcasting illithid.  The elder brains don't like it when a squddie starts slinging spells.  Too powerful, potential threats to thier own control of the septs.  So lots of spellcasting 'lithids come to Sigil.  Man, the brains must hate that.  That's why the Band of Steel had the Rish-i-Chal here move to Git'riban, I'm sure."</span></span>  He motions toward Du'minh.</p>

<p><span style="color:orange"><span style="font-weight:bold">"Well, now that Will is the only one of the triad left, Illithid House must be in tumoil.  I figure one of two things is happening, either lots of the rats are jumping ship and returning to other septs as we speak, or the most ambitious, competant, and dangerous illithid in the multiverse are streaming in.  Actually, both are probably happening simultaneously. The House will be bedlam, at least until the triad re-forms.  Which is where this whole thing gets interesting."</p>

<p>"There was a crystal, hidden inside Sight's robes, or so I found out when Vivec here asked a knowledgable gith what it was.  Now, I know that Sight had no idea he was carring the stone.  See, it's so simple.  The stone kept it arrogant, reckless, careless.  It was set up,"  </span></span> He smiles at the severed head and laughs,<span style="color:orange"> <span style="font-weight:bold">"And the berk never even saw it coming."</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color:orange"><span style="font-weight:bold">"Ha. ha. ha. ha.  See, that's the problem with prophesy and gazing into the future.  The future changes.  It's eye could only see potential, and usualy Sight sorted through dozens of potential futures when looking forward.  Helped me out once, when I actually saw myself in one.  That future didn't come true, let me tell you, even though I'll admit to doing some pretty shady things to lots of really shady knights to prevent it."</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color:orange"><span style="font-weight:bold">"So, what else you cutters want to know?  I'm an open book, then I walk outa here, that was the deal, right?  Now that the secret's out, I'm a runner.  The flayers'll want me alive, which they aint gonna get.  The Zerth mostly think I'm just a minor stag-turner, and there've always been 'yankis with something to prove, so I can expect more assasins and bravados.  The Silver Eyes found me useful, but you berks'll see to it they hear the truth right quick, and remember what I said downstairs about your usefulness and your life expectancy in this game."</span></span></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>[OOC:  Assume <span style="font-style:italic">detect thoughts</span> active and Sense Motive checks on Grazz as soon as he makes it clear that he’s about to tell his story.  Her reactions are assuming that he’s not resisting it and that what he says is true, or at least that Ya'shenn thinks he’s telling the truth.  She’s looking for truthfulness, but also for any and all information pertaining to the illithids.  (This may have the disadvantage of encountering some nausea-inducing memories of his, i.e., Sight having a square meal.)  Oh, yeah, and she'd also be alert for, to the extent she can tell, anything that looks like 'altered memories' or enthrallment.  Please lemme know if fairly long periods of time pass, as <span style="font-style:italic">detect thoughts</span> can eat up power points quickly.]</p>

<p>Once Grazz makes it clear he’s about to tell his story, the psion turns toward him and presses her palms together lightly, fingers pointed downward.  The woman's stance straightens and her gaze becomes a flat, intense stare -- almost as if she’s looking <span style="font-style:italic">through</span> the Accursed than <span style="font-style:italic">at</span> him, in fact.  Most people move their muscles slightly while standing or talking; right now, aside from breathing, the psion is as still as a statue.  As if these changes aren't indication enough, Ya’shenn’s two natural eyes adopt a distinct silvery hue, at exactly the same moment everyone in the room, particularly Grazz, feels an odd sensation of ‘static’ inside their heads.  The manifested power she’s using isn’t, on an absolute scale, all that powerful, yet the Githyanki is fairly crackling with psionic energy.</p>

<p>Midway through his tale, a faint shadow of a smile actually appears on the psion’s lips.  To actually <span style="font-style:italic">spy</span> on the Enemy! <span style="font-style:italic"> If this outrageous tale is actually true, Accursed, my opinion of you has just changed… to some degree</span>.  Suddenly, the reason why Grazz has survived so long seems very clear:  he must have been using Sight’s knowledge (and foreknowledge) to keep himself alive.</p>

<p>Another thing that becomes clear is the potential <span style="font-style:italic">value</span> of a puzzle piece such as Grazz... even in his current state.  There is one question that weighs especially heavily on her mind, but Ya'shenn will have a number of questions remaining after this one.</p>

<p><span style="color:darkblue">“Many claim that you have gone so far as to sell githyanki, githzerai, or perhaps both to the illithids.”</span>  Despite the hideousness of what Ya’shenn is describing, her tone of voice and demeanor are almost disturbingly calm.  <span style="color:darkblue">“Ever since I first heard that rumor, I’ve wondered what would motivate <span style="font-style:italic">any</span> child of <span style="font-style:italic">any</span> of the liberated Peoples to commit an act of such utter depravity.  Unless the one selling them were enthralled himself, of course.  First, is it true that you have sold githyanki -- or githzerai -- or others  --  to the Enemy?  Second, if it is, what moved you to do so?”   </span></p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;Azure&#039;</em> wrote:</div>Sight's still there, though, somehow, in the eyes.  Each one is different.  One's clairvoyant, one sees the future, and one controls what others see.</div></p>

<p>Ya’shenn breaks her rigid posture for a moment, looking over at the dead-not-quite-dead ulitharid.  <span style="color:darkblue">“Any chance that Sight, in its… reduced condition, is able to communicate with others of its kind?  I’d rather not have the illithids aware of this conversation… and neither would you, Accursed.”</span></p>

<p>OOC:  At the risk of sounding like I'm sucking up to the DM, this whole Grazz-the-Accursed thing is an awesome plot twist.  AWESOME.  Wasn't expecting it at all.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>The Nor’mujin warrior introduces himself to Ya’shenn as “Du’minh the Rish-I-Chal, warrior of the Band of Steel”, keeping formal but forthcoming, then joins to hear Grazz’ narrative.</p>

<p>Du’minh sits patiently through the story, though his reaction and body language clearly indicate that he finds the tale outrageous and astounding. When the story falls on his possible reason for being in Git’riban, the mage slayer keeps a straight face and doesn’t comment.<br />
When Grazz elaborates on the negative consequences of the resonance stone, however, Du’minh rethinks the safety of holding on to it. His vigilance and discipline wrestling with his arrogance and ego, the Rish musters his willpower to put the stone on the table away from his presence but into view of all collected.</p>

<p>At conclusion of the tale, Du’minh glances back and forth between Grazz, the fellow githyankis, and the severed head of Sight, looking for answers to dull his scepticism.</p>

<p><span style="color:olive">“Loathe as I am to admit it, these words make sense of the greater picture we are trying to form. We still have pieces to put together, however, and we are not quite done with this interview, Grazz. “List of contacts. Fellow traitors. Half the rooms in Illithid House.” These are your words and what you assured to give us, and with the… “insightful” experiences you speak of, you should have no trouble doing so. You must have seen an abundance of recognizable locations in Sigil that Sight has frequented with his tentacled peers. Rendezvous points for ghaiks, portals for getting into their safehouses, and more, we need everything you got.” </span></p>

<p>Going by her allegiance to the Double-Edged Mind, the Rish-I-Chal’s sight returns to the newest face in the flock:</p>

<p><span style="color:olive">“Ya’shenn, I trust Gy-Nath’s judgement when he places confidence in your abilities to discern the truth. What do you make of the Accursed’s story? I would not worry about possible mental eavesdropping via the remains of Sight, the lead sheeting and wardings of Haven Port should still keep out divining forces.”</span></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

I sense no direct falsehood from him whatsoever.  He’s holding back to some extent, but that doesn’t surprise me.”</span></p>

<p>"Accursed, day two. Never could forget that one."<br />
</div></p>

<p>Whatever image Grazz is referring to, it’s more than enough to make the psion turn away from him, visibly nauseated.  Rubbing her eyes and the bridge of her nose, as if doing so could actually dispel the sight of the Illithid art form known as ‘performance eating,’ the Double-Edged Mind mutters a response:</p>

<p><span style="color:darkblue">“Could be worse, Accursed.  You could have ended up wishing for Sight’s sense of<span style="font-style:italic"> taste</span>.”</span></p>

<p>Eventually, and having to resort to the trained self-discipline of a psion to do so, Ya’shenn manages to push the image back and regain her focus.  She does manage to notice the sudden appearance of the stone, and Grazz’s references to one.  <span style="color:darkblue">“How, exactly, did Sight end up in possession of that stone, especially without knowing it?”</span></p>

<p>The woman follows up with additional questions.  <span style="color:darkblue">“You sold others to the illithids, then.  Did you do this through a <span style="font-style:italic">ghaik</span> contact, or a third party?  Furthermore, did you ever encounter the ulitharid known as ‘Will?’  If so, what exactly do you know about It?”</span></p>

<p>The woman seems to be about to add something else, then glances over at Obsidian Orb.  Turning toward the Athasian gith, she’s careful to speak in as polite a tone as she can manage – for the Athasian probably won’t like what she’s about to say.  </p>

<p><span style="color:darkblue">“I wish that we had had the opportunity to meet under less… pressing circumstances than these.  Am I correct in assuming, by your presence here, that you have chosen the Great Enemy – that is, the illithid – as your own enemy?  Some of this information is… sensitive, to say the least.”</span></p>

<p>[OOC:  Assuming here that Ya'shenn knows enough about Athasian gith to know or guess that they might not have an insane hatred of mind flayers like ‘civilized folks’ do.  <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/wink.png" title="Eye-wink" alt="Eye-wink" class="smiley-content"/>  If not, ignore.  Also, if she knows Obsidian Orb by sight, she’d preface her question with ‘Chieftain Obsidian Orb.’  </p>

<p>Also, would githyanki in general, or Ya’shenn in particular, know about the existence of Illithid Creeds?  If so, it might come up either in this scene, or sometime later.]</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

A wild idea forms in Du’minh’s mind at these words, but he finds trouble with ascertaining its viability. He starts to speak, then reconsiders while gritting his teeth at the consequences, but decides to put forth his proposal in the end.</p>

         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;Zimrazim&#039;</em> wrote:</div>[ Ya’shenn manages to push the image back and regain her focus.  She does manage to notice the sudden appearance of the stone, and Grazz’s references to one.  <span style="color:darkblue">“How, exactly, did Sight end up in possession of that stone, especially without knowing it?”</span></p>

<p>The woman follows up with additional questions.  <span style="color:darkblue">“You sold others to the illithids, then.  Did you do this through a <span style="font-style:italic">ghaik</span> contact, or a third party?  Furthermore, did you ever encounter the ulitharid known as ‘Will?’  If so, what exactly do you know about It?”</span></p>

<p>The woman seems to be about to add something else, then glances over at Obsidian Orb.  Turning toward the Athasian gith, she’s careful to speak in as polite a tone as she can manage – for the Athasian probably won’t like what she’s about to say.  </p>

<p><span style="color:darkblue">“I wish that we had had the opportunity to meet under less… pressing circumstances than these.  Am I correct in assuming, by your presence here, that you have chosen the Great Enemy – that is, the illithid – as your own enemy?  Some of this information is… sensitive, to say the least.”</span></p>

<p>[OOC:  Assuming here that Ya'shenn knows enough about Athasian gith to know or guess that they might not have an insane hatred of mind flayers like ‘civilized folks’ do.  <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/wink.png" title="Eye-wink" alt="Eye-wink" class="smiley-content"/>  If not, ignore.  Also, if she knows Obsidian Orb by sight, she’d preface her question with ‘Chieftain Obsidian Orb.’  <br />
</div></p>

<p><span style="color:orange"> <span style="font-weight:bold">"My guess is that the thralls that dressed Sight that morning were dominated by Will, but it's just a guess."</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color:orange"><span style="font-weight:bold"><br />
"Just so the hotheads in here don't get the idea that they are honor-bound to kill me, let me assure you cutters that everybody I fed to the ghaik deserved it, and how!  Most of my contact is that arena was with a human, a Red Armada captain called Emir Rouge.  There're plenty of gith captains in the Red Armada who'd cut him to pieces if they found out he's been dealing with the illithids.  There was also a ghaik, a rat-catcher with no love for the elder brains called 'Mask', but he's vanished from Sigil recently, don't know why.  As for other stag-turners I've had contact with, and who I havent betrayed yet, there are about two dozen names and descriptions in Sigil can give you, but we've done a pretty good job scouring Git'riban of ghaik-loving scum.  In fact, once I leave you dicers, there're a couple of Zerth in the Sandstone District I need to see, so they can take out their own trash.  There's a few grey-robed 'flayer-friends I'm not going to need anymore."</p>

<p>"As for Will, man that's a scarry one.  Reputed to be one of the most mentally powerful ghaik of 'em all.  Crueler, more ruthless, and more ambitious than any other flayer, willing even to sell out it's own, apparently.  I wouldn't be surprized if Will had something to do with Zur Khaan getting away from Harbinger House and writing Knowledge into the dead book.  It's probably planning to form a new triad it can dominate."</span></span></p>

“Lady Ya’shenn, how far does your psionic talents with telepathy go? Would you find it in your power to impart some of Grazz’ memories on me? I might be more able to make sense of the magical affairs that this Triad member have been involved in.” 
</div></p>

<p><span style="color:darkblue">“It’s within my ability, yes.  If we decide to do that, though, I’d prefer it be toward the end of this meeting, rather than immediately.  It’s a bit taxing, and may or may not be our highest priority.”</span></p>

<p>[OOC:  Ya’shenn is simply conserving her psionic strength until she/the group decide what to spend it on, in case Grazz mentions other subjects that should also be explored thoroughly.  If Grazz makes more noises about ending the meeting, she’d be willing to mindlink the three of them for that information before he goes.]</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;Azure&#039;</em> wrote:</div>"Where I come from, all knowledge is sensitive, mindbender." Obsidian Orb replies to Ya'shenn, "Merely being able to read a printed text is a death sentence in the cities of the Sorcerer-Kings. And what they would do to a savage mage ...

I will make no secret of it; the Yanki Clan is powerful, and I respect and desire power, as any chieftain, or indeed any mage, worth her water should." </div></p>

<p>The psion’s eyes flash with wrath – literally! – when the word ‘mindbender’ is spoken, generating bright silver sparks.  The anger on her face begins to cool, however, as Ya’shenn listens carefully to the rest of what the gith chieftain has to say.  <span style="color:darkblue">“Obsidian Orb, the rest of your words are spoken with wisdom, so I choose to assume that you called me<span style="font-style:italic"> that word </span>out of ignorance, not malice.  No Githyanki would wish to be referred to as a ‘mindbender.’”</span></p>

<p>[OOC:  ‘First Contact’ situations are fun. <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/wink.png" title="Eye-wink" alt="Eye-wink" class="smiley-content"/>  ]</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the psion appears to accept the Athasian’s presence – or at least to tolerate it.  She looks to each of the others, but particularly to Du’minh.  <span style="color:darkblue">“Any of you may ask questions of the Accursed, if you have them.  I can still verify the truthfulness of his answers, and your asking them won’t break my concentration.”</span></p>

<p>After some mental hesitation, Ya’shenn asks the question she was (and is) reluctant to ask in the presence of an alien.</p>

<p><span style="color:darkblue">“Grazz,” </span>suddenly he’s not ‘Accursed One’ anymore it seems, <span style="color:darkblue">“I’d imagine that the <span style="font-style:italic">ghaik</span> continues to plot against the Githyanki, and for that matter, the Githzerai.  How much damage have the Illithids done so far, and what do they have in mind in the future?  What future attacks are they planning?”</span></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Du’minh turns his focus to Grazz, conjuring the most important queries he has been pondering about.</p>

<p><span style="color:olive">“This armada captain, Emir Rouge, and the renegade ghaik, Mask, how would we go about tracking each down? By which manner did you use to establish contact with them?”</p>

<p>“In the hours up to the attack in the Heart of the Void, you would have seen Sight mobilize forces of Illithid House, probably confer with Will, and move throughout the ghaik sanctuaries and Undersigil until finally arriving at the battle field. I need you to describe that scene thoroughly, especially in relation to which set of portals the ulitharid travelled through and how to activate them, as well as traps, guardians, and safeguards placed along that route. Write it down, if need be. This could be our path to tracking the beast back to its lair, when the time comes.”</p>

<p>“I am curious, however, why you came to the Silver Eyes when you first discovered the impending attack. Why us?”</span></p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div><span style="color:orange">"I highly doubt that plan will end well, Du'minh,"</span> says Daraz, <span style="color:orange">"But it's your head and you are free to do with it what you will.

<p><span style="color:darkblue">“It’s within my ability, yes.  If we decide to do that, though, I’d prefer it be toward the end of this meeting, rather than immediately.  It’s a bit taxing, and may or may not be our highest priority.”</span></div><br />
The Rish nods in understanding to his companions, but is not swayed from abandoning the idea.</p>

<p><span style="color:olive">“I am not putting this forward lightly, but I am willing to do what needs to be done if it provides greater service for the People. Let it take place at the end of our meeting then, and restricted to recent magical incidents of obvious importance.”</p>

<p>“Also…”</span> he glances from Gy-Nath to Ya’shenn. <span style="color:olive">“There are reasons I cannot speak of at this moment.”</span></p>

<p>Hoping either of the two will catch his drift and read his mind, Du’minh communicates further via his thoughts.</p>

<p><span style="color:olive"><span style="font-style:italic">“The Accursed cannot possibly convey every bit of information he has gained from the Triad and the House before we must end this congregation. His legendary feats of survival are doubtlessly caused heavily by the foresight of the ulitharid – now that his curse is effectively broken, he speaks truthfully in that he will not live much longer.”</span></span></p>

         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;Dunamin&#039;</em> wrote:</div>Du’minh turns his focus to Grazz, conjuring the most important queries he has been pondering about.</p>

<p><span style="color:olive">“This armada captain, Emir Rouge, and the renegade ghaik, Mask, how would we go about tracking each down? By which manner did you use to establish contact with them?”</p>

<p>“In the hours up to the attack in the Heart of the Void, you would have seen Sight mobilize forces of Illithid House, probably confer with Will, and move throughout the ghaik sanctuaries and Undersigil until finally arriving at the battle field. I need you to describe that scene thoroughly, especially in relation to which set of portals the ulitharid travelled through and how to activate them, as well as traps, guardians, and safeguards placed along that route. Write it down, if need be. This could be our path to tracking the beast back to its lair, when the time comes.”</p>

<p>“I am curious, however, why you came to the Silver Eyes when you first discovered the impending attack. Why us?”</span><br />
</div></p>

<p><span style="color:orange"><span style="font-weight:bold">"Well that last one is simple, The Silver Eyes were nearby.  I knew the flayers were about to hit somebody, but I didn't know who.  Had I been in the Hive instead of Git'riban last night, it would have been the Zerth that got the warning."</p>

<p>"As for my contacts, Emir Rouge is a high-up cap'n, comes to Sigil a lot to dump his booty.  Go up to the Market Ward and look for a tall, dark-haired human with a beard.  He'll be wearing red, as will his dozen-or-so pirate guards.  A few turns ago, he got beat to quarters by a squidship, so him and his whole crew are 'lithid spies.  In fact, I wouldn't trust ANY Red Armada pirate for that very reason, they could've come off that ship and are serving under another captain by now.  You noticed many of the pirates hanging around this place are Reds, I take it.  The captains are O.K., but don't blab around a midshipman."</p>

<p>"The Mask was real easy to find.  Shait, it had, like, a regular day job.  Ratcatcher in the Lady's and Lower Wards.  Pretty good at tracking down cranium rats.  Wierdass brain-sucker that one.  Hated the triad and the House, but hated elder brains even more.  I don't know where Mask is now, it disappeared from Sigil about a month ago."</p>

<p>"As for other stag-turners and 'lithid lovers, well there're a few the Zerth'll take care of, there's one I'm gonna shiv myself shortly,"</span></span>  He actually hangs his head and looks sad at the mention of the last one, <span style="font-size:9px">[Ya'shenn sees a pretty female githzerai, but the image is quickly squashed by Grazz] </span><span style="color:orange"><span style="font-weight:bold">But for you cutters I'll give you the last thralls in Git'riban, that I know of.  The first one's name is Mim, and he works at Void Keys, accross the street from Silver Void Steelworks.  I could never give him up because he only reported to Knowlege of the triad, and I didn't want the ghaik to know that Sight was the leak.  The second one is a crippled vet who owns a sharpener shop here in the Heart of The Void.  The last is a little street-urchin named Miik'ka."</span></span>  He looks sad again, <span style="color:orange"><span style="font-weight:bold">"Start with her if you can, cutters.  She's got a whole life of slavery ahead of her.  Each one of those I mentioned are irrecoverable <span style="font-size:9px"><span style="color:black">[edit]</span></span> and have psionic marks on them.  Of course, there're bound to be spies even I don't know about, but I don't need a stone to tell me I'm hende.  I kept pretty good track of squiddie spies, cuz my life depended on it."</span></span></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<span style="color:darkblue">“Grazz,” </span>suddenly he’s not ‘Accursed One’ anymore it seems, <span style="color:darkblue">“I’d imagine that the <span style="font-style:italic">ghaik</span> continues to plot against the Githyanki, and for that matter, the Githzerai.  How much damage have the Illithids done so far, and what do they have in mind in the future?  What future attacks are they planning?”</span></div></p>

<p><span style="color:orange"><span style="font-weight:bold">"Ah, excellent question!  There're three kinds of ghaik in Sigil, ones that can't show their slimy tenticles in any of elder-brain controled septs, 'loyal' ones who are merchants, of a sort, and ones who use Sigil as a base to lauch big, plane-spanning plans.  There's some overlap, of course, especially between the outcasts and the 'big thinkers'.  Lots of 'little plans', of course, every ghaik's got a dozen of them, but I'd say there're five 'big plans' in the House."</p>

<p>"The scariest to me is The Awakening.  Some 'thids are working with other alien races to bring appocalypic shait to the planes.  They woke up an Elder Evil in Pandemonium recently, but I think somebody put it back under wraps, cuz I haven't heard more about it.  They're the ones working with the Tsochar and Aboleth.  Brrr.  Now, I'm a Sinker, but I'm not one of those that thinks huge tracks of multiverse gotta go down all at once, so I tried to get certain sects of the Doomguard to oppose the waking of various Dark Gods, with a little success, anyway.  See, one comman theme to a lot of Sight's visions is a stepping up of that very thing.  Think about it; Veccna's back, Kyuss is tearing up a few primes, Demogorgon's lauching a savage tide,  and where the fuck did kaorti come from?  The multiverse is going to the whistles, friends."</p>

<p>"Big idea number two, and number one as far as the flayers are concerned, is The Darkening.  This is whack, because they've even got some Athar on their side, assassinating sun priests.  They think if they can dead-book Ra, Appolo, and other powers with 'The Sun' in their portfolio, their job of snuffing out suns on the primes will be easier.  Barmy if you ask me, but they've got the blessing of the elder brains, dispite the fact that it hasn't worked yet."</p>

<p>"Plan three is The Grey War.  Githzerai are much more comman on the outer planes than githyanki, and in smaller enclaves, generally.  Much of the House's resources are directed against the Zerth.  There's been some more activity in the subversion side of this recently, but I'm still trying to figure out what exactly it means.  Will is the main 'thid in charge of The Grey War, so whatever is going on, the Zerth are in trouble."</p>

<p>"Next we come to exploiting the current troubles in the Astral.  There are lots of 'little plans' all competing to become a 'big plan'.  I've no doubt that some of the infighting is being directed by the illithid, but since Sigil is mostly cut off from the Silver Void, such activities against your people are mostly based in the septs.  I know that there are plots to assassinate the Princesses of The Accendancy, as well as the leaders of The True.  In fact, I saved that street-preacher's pretty arse three times, not that that Gish'd ever thank me if she knew, but she's got a few potential futures I felt were important to save."</p>

<p>"Plan four involves a bunch of the spellslingin' 'thids.  They're researching how the elder brains were made.  If they find out, they want to make their own, which will then become a spellslinging elder brain.  Yea, bad, really really bad.  Their ranks were thinned a cycle or so ago by The Lady, cuz they planned to do it in Sigil.  I call 'em the Poolers.  Sight was their current leader, but as far as I know he never foresaw it actually working."</p>

<p>"Last, but certainly not least in my opinion, is the Unterreich. The 'merchant' 'thids are building what amounts to a gigantic slaver ring and criminal organization, taking over the underworlds of various gate-towns and planar burgs.  They recently suffered a setback, though, when their overseer for the Outlands, known as 'The Thingpin' got dead-booked in Bedlam.  Seems it was there to help the Awakeners with their scheme on the windy plane.  The Unterreich is still sore about that one, and are looking for the killers."</span></span>  He gives Gy-Nath a meaningful look.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>The extent of <span style="font-style:italic">ghaik</span> manipulations is… alarming.  Not all that surprising, really, but disturbing to hear about nonetheless.  What Grazz has to say about illithid operations against her own species is bad enough, but she had thought it would have been even worse. </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;Dunamin&#039;</em> wrote:</div>
Du’minh takes his time to soak up the information, making sure to memorize names, descriptions and other important notes. </p>

<p>“We shall follow up on these contacts and leads, handling those involved according to their involvement with Illithid House. The overview of ghaik operations and campaigns is also beneficial to our cause, though their extent gives many concerns to priority of when and where to strike next.” </p>

<p>Taking a look around the table, Du’minh folds his arms. </p>

<p>“I find this intelligence quite sating for us to work with and have no need for further inquiry on the matter, for now... At least not by way of words.”<br />
</div></p>

<p>Ya’shenn nods in agreement, taking note of the Rish’s mental signature for future reference.  She already has Grazz’s.  It seems to her that the Accursed has much more information to be harvested, but it’s quite clear that Du’minh has something to say that’s better conveyed mind-to-mind.  Narrowing her eyes in concentration, the psion patiently fashions a mental tether between the hunter’s mind and her own, then repeats the process with the Accursed.</p>

<p><span style="color:darkblue"><span style="font-style:italic">~There</span></span>, Ya’shenn sends to both of them.  <span style="color:darkblue"><span style="font-style:italic">~Grazz, the Mage Hunter may be able to interpret what you’ve seen of Sight’s magical activities.</span></span></p>

<p>A slight pause, then,</p>

<p><span style="color:darkblue"><span style="font-style:italic">~And</span> do <span style="font-style:italic">try to keep the gratuitous brain-eating to a minimum this time.</span></span></p>

<p>[OOC:  Mindlink between Du'minh - Ya'shenn - Grazz.  DM, please let me know if Ya’shenn’s power points start looking dangerously low; she won’t drain herself completely (though I think she still has a ways to go yet before that happens).</p>

<p>Make up the visible manifestation of the Mindlink power of your choice, but the "ephemeral translucent goo" that the Psi Handbook describes is just a tiny bit too weird and gross for me. </p>

<p>Poor Du’minh, only telepaths and species with secret sign-languages get to have secret conversations.   <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/lol.png" title="Laughing out loud" alt="Laughing out loud" class="smiley-content"/>  ]</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Ya'shenn concentrates and brethes deeply, entering a trance-like state.  A soft aurora engulfs her, Du'minh and Grazz, and a quiet humm vibrates on the very edges of hearing.</p>

<p>Grazz conjures up many memories from the past, rushing through them as he tries to concentrate on specific visions.  Du'minh and Ya'shenn feel Grazz 's honest regret that he did not pay more attention to Sight's arcane doings.  Du'minh sees from Sight's perspective, the casting of ancient bones and crystals carved with glyphs, the slaughter of various beings to read their entrails, the careful observation of the death-spasms of glyph-painted slaves when fed deadly arcane halucinagens.  Sight was a diviner, whose foresight was certainly not limited to what it's magical eyes saw.</p>

<p>Du'minh sees Sight's circle of mages, twelve of them.  Partly because Grazz learned their individual physical differances, so does Du'minh.  He will be able to recognize any of these particular ghaik on sight now, the twelve most powerful spellcasting illithids in Sigil.  </p>

<p>One seems more powerful than the rest, a long-headed, thin-tenticled ghaik with paler skin, whose spells are unsubtle blasts of arcane power.  The others seem to fear it, for it often seems to be in bad temper.  There are glimses of this one (and Grazz indicates that these were cases where Sight was spying from afar) meeting with another, very tall ghaik in a hood.  Du'minh gets a only a glimse of the hooded one's tenticle tips.  They are white, and dry, one ending prematurely in a stump.</p>

<p>Another, a darker-skinned ghaik with scars like it had been mauled by great claws, is seen casting sumoning spells, and magicly binding various fiends to it's will.</p>

<p>Then Grazz's thoughts turn to a curious and reoccuring thing he often wondered about.  An elaborate spell ritual is set up, just before Sight removes it's eyes and it all goes blank.  This happens several times, but with small changes each time.   There is a place in the center for the three eye spheres, so it is obvious that it is the eyes that are recieving the spell.  The setup changes indicate spell research, an altered, perhaps more powerful version of a more common spell.  After the eighth one, Du'minh thinks he recognizes aspects of the set-up, research into a version of <span style="font-style:italic">magic jar</span>.  There are more, many more.  It seems Sight was constantly trying to put it's conciousness into the eyes, trying and believing it failed.  Each time there was the dark summoner and one other ghaik present, another one of the twelve.  Short, muscular for an illithid, with belts, straps, and bags full of tools.  An artificer.</p>

<p>Then Grazz returns to the remaining casters, trying to recall instances where they were seen to cast spells.  From what he sees, Du'minh notes each. [As does Ya'shenn, but she has to be told by Du'minh what it all means]</p>

<p>{Summary:</p>

<p>1) Powerful sorcerer ghaik with an alhoon friend</p>

<p>2) Summoner/binder</p>

<p>3) Artificer</p>

<p>4) Fleshwarper with various grafts that change constantly</p>

<p>5) Transmuter, seems to partner up with #4 a lot</p>

<p>6) Healthy-looking ghaik who seems to love wands, carries half a dozen</p>

<p>7) Feeble ghaik who leans on a staff, often followed by thralls carrying heavy tomes.  Some of the others seem to defer to this one.  Oddly, this ghaik has thin whisps of white hair on it's head</p>

<p>8-12) General Mages [i.e. DM creativity is tapped out now].  Du'minh and Ya'shenn will still recognize these illithids on sight.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>When the process starts out, Du’minh is thoroughly horrified by the experience despite his attempt to prepare himself. The Rish grips tightly at the edge of the table with his eyes widened in shock, almost beginning to hyperventilate. Fumbling to discipline himself, he closes his eyes and gradually finds control, taking deep breaths and easing his mind to let it all flow into place.</p>

<p>The warrior furrows his brow when memories glide in with visions of mighty mages and rituals, concern and traces of fear playing across his face. A tiny fragment of sympathy for Grazz manifests after a while, especially at the notion of what horrors Du’minh is being spared from.</p>

<p>The mage hunter sits patiently through the session, sealing every mind-fragment away in his memory, going through them methodically in turn to make sure he will never forget. When the process is complete Du’minh rises to his feet, visibly burdened by the intrusion of alien recollections.</p>

<p>He turns and points a shaking finger at the head of the ulitharid, dread and exhaustion cycling through his frame.</p>

         <p>The Rish responds to Ya’shenn’s sympathy back through the mental link.</p>

<p><span style="color:olive"><span style="font-style:italic">“Your concern is appreciated, Lady Ya’shenn, but unneeded. I was merely taken by surprise by the extent of monstrosity carried out in these memories.”</span></span></p>

<p>Du’minh regains his bearings and considers the situation for a moment, then casts a piece of cloth over the head.</p>

<p><span style="color:olive">“The magic in question requires direct unblocked connection through the atmospheric continuum for a resident spirit to attempt an attack. That is <span style="font-style:italic">if</span> Sight’s spirit should still exist in these crystals and <span style="font-style:italic">if</span> the eldritch ritual worked successfully in a similar manner to how it is commonly conducted. Just for added safety, let us keep it covered at all times.”</p>

<p>“However.”</span> Du’minh looks gravely at everyone in the room. <span style="color:olive">“There is a possibility – if the magic worked as intended – that Sight resides in another host at this time. Should we see any signs of this, the crystals must be destroyed immediately. The ulitharid’s spirit would be forced back to its body and find death. Again.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:9px">OOC:<br />
Du’minh is going with the notion here, that the <span style="font-style:italic">magic jar</span> spell requires line of effect between the item and the victim.</span></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p><span style="color:orange"><span style="font-weight:bold">"Of course, most of the rooms in Illithid House are in Undersigil, so finding 'em from the street is going to be hard, but I've pieced together a portal map from how Sight moved around."</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:9px"><span style="font-weight:bold">[DM, basicly, Du'minh and Ya'shenn get good visuals of portaled archways, especially in the three Hubs.  I'll handle this plot-wise, i.e. you're sure to recognize some portals leading around Illithid House once in, and will be able to navigate from one ghaik 'safe-room' to the next without getting totally lost (unless Evil DM wants you to get lost in hostile territory)  The best info of course comes from the most recent memories, so Sight's route from 'The Celler' to Git'riban is crystal clear.</p>

<p>A variety of security measures are shown, thrall sentries being the most common, but the wiley ghaik use psionic traps, deadfalls and booby traps, magical wards, ravenous monsters, and even ghaik.]  </span></span><br />

<p><span style="color:darkblue">“Illithids <span style="font-style:italic">are</span> parasites, but Sight must have been desperate -- I can’t see most <span style="font-style:italic">ghaik</span> being happy about being alive only through what they would consider a ‘thrall’ race.  The potential for infiltration is obvious, but it seems to me it would be beneath a ulitharid’s pride.”</span></p>

<p>Ya’shenn pointedly avoids looking at the severed head and the problematic crystals.  <span style="color:darkblue">“As for destroying the eyes… perhaps immersion in acid, or using a superior gemstone or metal to break them would work, but I’m not sure which stone the eyes are made of.

<p>Privately, the psion wonders whether destroying the eyes will have negative effects on Grazz himself – though she does not share that concern with him just yet.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">
