</div> <p>Greetings mortals, exemplars, planars, and primes alike.  Some of you may remember me from ages ago.  I am Center of All, aurumach and former haunt of this place.  Maintaining the balance is a busy task, and that task took me away from this place for some time.  Now, the equilibrium holds more steadily and allows me to return for a while.</p>

<p>I have recently begun work on a project that, in true Planescape form, deals with identity, nature, <span style="font-style:italic">belief</span>, and the forces that shape these things.  This project requires me to research ideas, concepts, and <span style="font-style:italic">beliefs</span> from those around me.  And so, for the sake of my project, which will be revealed in due course, I pose this question to you all.  When I am satisfied or when I feel the time has arrived, I will give another question to you.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">What can cause a fiend to rise?</span></p>

<p>Fiends are thoroughly evil, wicked beings.  Baatezu tyrants, yugoloth manipulators, and tanar'ri beguilers, all of these revel in their evil, delight in causing pain and suffering.  Many view their upper planar counterparts with disdain, seeing them as weak because of their morals.  Why, then, would a fiend, a creature of such thorough evil want to rise above it and emulate the archons, guardinals, and celestials?  What would cause him to alter the core of his being in such a profound way?  And furthermore, should or would a fiend risen in such a way lose his natural powers?  Many fiends possess innate magic that most mortals must study diligently to acquire.  Are these granted to fiends because they are evil, or because they simply are?</p>

<p>I look forward to what you <span style="font-style:italic">believe</span> the answer is.</p>       </div>

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><p>
You answer your own question, my good Aurumach. <span style="font-style:italic">Belief</span>.
</p>
<p>
Let me offer you an example. A Fiend, in some eternal, malicious scheme, commits an act that can be percieved as good by a number of people. Perhaps this Fiend stops a rampaging dragon, knowing that one of the people who the dragon would kill would become a horrid tyrant and warlord, who would cause more suffering, and more importantly, condemn more souls to the Lower Realms than a cleansing gout of dragonfire ever could.
</p>
<p>
But the Fiend does it by slaying the dragon in an aerial combat above a great city. This will cause a very large number of people to believe that Fiend to be good (perhaps the Fiend was somehow disguised that they do not assume the sinister truth). And this belief has a force. Now... a few years down the line, this tyrant comes to power, but the Fiend dislikes him. Mayhaps he is too chaotic, or too lawful. So the fiend will overthrow him, and in the process, cause more people to believe him to be good.
</p>
<p>
 This continues. In time, the Fiend will *become* good. Perhaps his fellows will see his action in a (better) light and eject him on their own. Perhaps he realizes what is happening and exits on his own initiative. Perhaps the Fiend sees the people of the great city as too useful to be used as mere dupes, and slowly transforms into a guardian spirit.
</p>
<p>
It is <span style="font-style:italic">Belief</span> that can change. Other's belief, or perhaps the Fiend's own belief. But it is Belief.

Well my post has nothing to do with Belief, it's all about convenience.  I'm playing two risen fiends.  The first is in a solo game where the DM decided he had amnesia from falling in the Styx and has no idea why he's good.  Though recently he found out it had something to do with a tanned woman who was the leader of a group of rightious assassins, think the trailer for Wanted.  The other was captured by an elven wizard and experimented on for centuries, and accedentally made neutral.  Later he escaped, with a big grudge against slavery and found the mindless violence of the world around him to be extremely stupid, so being curious and meddlesome he tries on occation to understand it and see if he can alter it

          I wonder, O Large, Sour        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>I wonder, O Large, Sour Fruit, did you ever find out why the Styx-touched fiend turned good?  And for the second, please elaborate, how did he turn the fiend neutral?  I see the seeds of something great have been planted, so let me see if I can coax them to grow.  Even if you don't know, speculation is welcome.  This is not about what is, but rather what you <span style="font-style:italic">believe</span> it is.  If you do not know for certain, make up a story.  I will be pleased to read, consider, and comment.</p>

<p>As for you, my fine Five-Headed Dragon, I am hardly "good," but your idea provokes thought.  Essentially, you say it is not an intentional act on the fiend's part.  Rather, those that the fiend's actions affect turn him good by <span style="font-style:italic">believing</span> him so.  Do I understand correctly?</p>

<p>I ask you this:  How much <span style="font-style:italic">belief</span> does it take to transform a fiend's mind and soul toward good?  A village?  A city?  A kingdom?  An entire world?  Is there a threshold for when <span style="font-style:italic">belief</span> of others takes hold and shapes one being?</p>

<p>I gave my original question in another venue and I have received a response that also intrigues me.  The person <span style="font-style:italic">believes</span>, similar to you, that rising may not be intentional.  The fiend inadvertently performs an act of goodness and, in doing so, experiences the good feeling associated with that act.  That feeling becomes a sort of euphoria for the fiend, who comes to crave it.  It becomes addictive, creating a circle.  Do good, feel good, do more good, feel more good.</p>

<p>Love, too, has been suggested.  A fiend does good works to try and make someone fall in love with her.  In the process, doing good becomes such a part of her life that she finds she can no longer be without it.</p>

<p>What do you <span style="font-style:italic">believe</span>?</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

          Well, how do you measure        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><p>
Well, how do you measure belief, my Neutral Aurumach? Is it sold in pints or ounces or grams? Can I have a bushel of belief, or will is it a dram?
</p>
<p>
Belief is a tricky thing to measure, but I would be hesitant to label &quot;So many folk's worth of belief, and no less.&quot; I envision it as a relative thing. How strongly do they believe? Perhaps one man can believe a fiend into goodness, if that man is a saint. But if an entire world has a merely passive acceptance of that fact, is it enough? For that matter, how many folks believe <span style="font-style:italic">otherwise</span>, and are convinced that the Fiend is beyond the pale of villainy?
</p>
<p>
For the latter, I am not so certain, except as an avenue to belief. To do good for a reward is not to <span style="font-style:italic">be</span> good. If a Fiend saves a child out of the expectation of a reward, even a reward that is emotional gratification, then the Fiend has not become good, he has merely committed a good action, though I would hold that the expectation of a reward undercuts the virtue. Of course, the <span style="font-style:italic">child</span> may grow to believe the Fiend good, so it is a tangled web woven here.

 Love... pshaw.

Well the first fiend's reasons are extremely mysterious since they are known only by my DM whom you may know as Trias the amazing dissapearing poster.  He's vanished without warning again it seems, so I just have to wait.
</p>
<p>
The second fiend was made neutral because it was convenient for the game.  I suppose if I was to make something up I'd say that the wizard had developed DNA/gene manipulation and used it to alter the fiend's very nature.  There was one other fiend he did this to and he then put the two of them together so they developed a sort of familial bond, but then he decided to seperate them and fake the other's death for both of them.

<p>
To do good for a reward is not to <span style="font-style:italic">be</span> good. If a Fiend saves a child out of the expectation of a reward, even a reward that is emotional gratification, then the Fiend has not become good, he has merely committed a good action, though I would hold that the expectation of a reward undercuts the virtue. Of course, the <span style="font-style:italic">child</span> may grow to believe the Fiend good, so it is a tangled web woven here.  </div> 
</p>
<p>
 Ahh, Kantian morality, truly the finest tool Baator has developed thus far! 
</p>
<p>
By this logic Aasimon are truly diabolical because their good actions are motivated by a desire to further the cause of 'good' in the multiverse and thereby thwart those that have been designated 'evil'. 
</p>
<p>
To set the standard of good at this level is to destroy it and to promote evil, or at least a moral apathy, as all actions can, at some levels, be seen as being selfish. 
</p>
<p>
eg. A man saves the soul of a child from a Yugoloth at great physical and financial cost to himself and is not recognised for doing so. He does this because he believes that this is the right thing to do. Therfore by performing this act his strength of convictions are bolstered by the evidence that there are in fact 'good' (as he defines it) people in the world. He also recieves a sense of satisfaction that the child is safe and will have the opportunity to grow up. Furthermore it could be argued that the man may be aware that he is tipping the multiversal scales towards 'goodness' (the side he supports) and thus he is merely attempting to metaphorically 'score a goal' for his side. 
</p>
<p>
Therefore this man is in fact despicable because he has used the child as a pawn in the cosmic battle between good and evil, inadvertantly saving it's soul in the process. 
</p>
<p>
&#160;
</p>
<p>
&quot;What can change the nature of a Fiend?&quot; 
</p>
<p>
To come back to the topic, I agree that ultimately belief can achieve anything on the Outer Planes, however Faces of Evil states that that Baatezu sometimes also 'rise', or slide from lawful to chaotic to avoid punishment from their superiors/peers after disobeying orders. Such beings are often never fully trusted by their new comrades but ironically this displays a lack of belief in the power of good to change the nature of a being by the paragons of that side of the cosmic battle.

         <p><p>
I pose a question for you my friends.
</p>
<p>
Fiends are composed of pure belief  in the same way that mortals are composed of a combination of belief and matter.  But has been seen before, one's belief is not necessarily one's disposition.  All fiends are made of the form of belief classified by scholars as sub-type evil.  But across Sigil, fiends have been seen with certainly less than evil dispositions and alignments.  Neutral being the most common.
</p>
<p>
My question to you all is, when you speak, do you speak of a fiend's alignment?  Which does not coincide with their belief. 
</p>
<p>
or do you speak of their belief, the essence that they are made of?
</p>
<p>
I feel this is an important distinction as it defines what exactly is a  &quot;risen fiend.&quot;  Is it one whose alignment is good but might still be made from evil belief?  Or is it one whose core essence has been altered to that of good?  Perhaps one is risen and the other is simply rehabilitated?

I'd like to see this other reply that intrigues you so.
</div></p>

<p>Truly nothing at all to say?  No insights to share with the other planewalkers?  I am saddened, but the balance will go on.  If you think of something, you are more than welcome to enter the discussion.</p>

<p>As for other venues, I posted once in my deviantART, where I have yet to receive an answer that sufficiently piques my interest.  The answer I listed above came from my Livejournal and it is the only answer so far.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>Azriael</em> wrote:</div>To come back to the topic, I agree that ultimately belief can achieve anything on the Outer Planes, however Faces of Evil states that that Baatezu sometimes also 'rise', or slide from lawful to chaotic to avoid punishment from their superiors/peers after disobeying orders.

<p>You make an excellent point on the irony.  It then leads one to wonder, is a fiend risen in this way truly good?  If a fiend can rise to escape punishment, which sounds a bit counter-intuitive to an archon's mindset, then is belief as a shaping force required to transform a fiend from evil to good?</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>Dire Lemon</em> wrote:</div>The second fiend was made neutral because it was convenient for the game.  I suppose if I was to make something up I'd say that the wizard had developed DNA/gene manipulation and used it to alter the fiend's very nature.  There was one other fiend he did this to and he then put the two of them together so they developed a sort of familial bond, but then he decided to seperate them and fake the other's death for both of them.</div></p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>jareddm</em> wrote:</div>I feel this is an important distinction as it defines what exactly is a  "risen fiend."  Is it one whose alignment is good but might still be made from evil belief?  Or is it one whose core essence has been altered to that of good?

<p>I place these two together because they are, in a sense, related.  In his explanation of DNA/gene manipulation, Dire Lemon suggests the same thing most of us already understand or believe -- fiends are naturally evil from the moment of their creation.  However, assuming you can change a fiend's DNA and make the fiend neutral or good (assuming a fiend has DNA as we know it, since such concepts are not addressed in the Planescape setting short of alu-fiends, tieflings, and their ilk), is what you have still a fiend, or has your tampering made it something else?  This does bring to mind further questions regarding DNA manipulation at large, but that is for another discussion.  This one is strictly about fiends <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/smile.png" title="Smiling" alt="Smiling" class="smiley-content"/></p>

<p>Jared, you mimic my initial question with your post.  Part of my intention is to understand how people define the very questions you ask.  What is a risen fiend and how does he reach that state?  What moves him to goodness, and once he is there, does he retain the powers he had when he was evil?  I encourage this discussion, which I participate in by asking questions of what people say, requesting they elaborate on why they believe certain points.  So now, I invite you to answer your own questions for me.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

I place these two together because they are, in a sense, related.  In his explanation of DNA/gene manipulation, Dire Lemon suggests the same thing most of us already understand or believe -- fiends are naturally evil from the moment of their creation.  However, assuming you can change a fiend's DNA and make the fiend neutral or good (assuming a fiend has DNA as we know it, since such concepts are not addressed in the Planescape setting short of alu-fiends, tieflings, and their ilk), is what you have still a fiend, or has your tampering made it something else?  This does bring to mind further questions regarding DNA manipulation at large, but that is for another discussion.  This one is strictly about fiends <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/smile.png" title="Smiling" alt="Smiling" class="smiley-content"/>
Jared, you mimic my initial question with your post.  Part of my intention is to understand how people define the very questions you ask.  What is a risen fiend and how does he reach that state?  What moves him to goodness, and once he is there, does he retain the powers he had when he was evil?  I encourage this discussion, which I participate in by asking questions of what people say, requesting they elaborate on why they believe certain points.  So now, I invite you to answer your own questions for me.</div>
</p>
<p>
 My personal view on this topic stem from the idea that all beings are capable of belief, even those made from belief.  All beings have a personality and alignment.  A fiend that does good deeds simply to feel good is not changing its essence, it is changing its disposition.  This would make the fiend an ally of the forces of good, but certainly not risen.  Being risen requires not only your own belief, but the belief and support of others.  Everyone believes that fiends are evil, and so they are.  But to believe that a specific fiend is not evil, requires an enormous amount of will, most of all the fiend's own.  Now I subscribe to the idea that when it comes to yourself, no one's belief has more of an impact than your own.  For a fiend to unwillingly raise in a way that it's core essense is changed, is one of the most difficult acts I could imagine, requiring the belief from countless other beings, each focused on this one specific fiend to raise.  If the fiend truely believes itself to be good and performs good acts, a substantially fewer number of individuals would be required to aid in this fiend's raising, possibly even none if the fiend is dedicated with a truely legendary focus and will.
</p>
<p>
  To summerize, it is easy to change one's alignment and disposition.  It is mearly a matter of a personality change.  It is a substantial act to change one's essense, requiring an immense amount of belief and will to achieve.

<p>Allow me to take this a few steps further.  Could a fiend dwelling on any of the good-aligned planes become good simply by staying there, even if he does not actually do anything that matches the plane's alignment?</p>

<p>
A fiend that has changed personality but not essence is still a fiend, but one that does not follow the tenets of its race.  They still have their abilities, but are possibly using them for the &quot;wrong&quot; reasons according to their race.  Depending on the severity of the change, the fiend could be treated as an outcast or a criminal.  I am actually unsure of what to make  of greater fiends that personalities.  I'm not sure whether they would be under even stricter control, to follow the proper ideals, since it would be a much greater blow for their race if they were to &quot;switch sides&quot;, or be allowed more leniency than normal, given their higher stature in the fiendish hierarchy.  My personal opinion leans more towards the latter, as the range of personalities among greater fiends is much broader than those of lesser fiends

<p>
If a fiend's essence changes, by definition it is no longer a fiend.  More than likely it will lose its powers, though it is just as possible that some powers will simply change their form.  As far as a physical change, this may be more of a personal preference of the fiend.  A truly reformed fiend might not wish to ever look upon its old form again.  On the other hand, it might serve the forces of good's best interest for the fiend to remain in its original form, as you suggest.

An excellent question (and one I'm inclined to steal to be used as an adventure).  As I suggested before, I feel that if the fiend itself does not believe it is good and is unwilling to change, the amount of belief among primes that would be required in this example would be astronomically high, though certainly not impossible.  In such a case, I can't help but pity the fiend.  To have your core essence changed against your will, while possibly with the best of intentions on the part of others, is certainly not to be a plesent experience.

         <p>I apologize on the first point for the confusion.  My intent in suggesting a greater fiend like those above was not to specify the consequences a greater fiend may face from his superiors, but rather to propose an example of a fiend that possesses numerous innate, fiend-born powers.  A creature like a quasit or a spinagon has considerably less to lose if his powers are revoked.  A glabrezu, by contrast...</p>

<p>Let me ask you this, then.  In the hypothetical example I proposed, what would the Primes' belief accomplish?  Would it do anything at all?  Belief does have impact.  However, if I understand you correctly, a proper change takes a conscious effort on the part of the one changing.  On the other hand, in order for the fiend's essence, his core being to rise above his evil roots, it requires not only his own belief, but the faith of others in his goodness.  Is that correct?  </p>

<p>Also, you are more than welcome to use that question for an adventure.  If you do, please let me know how it turns out <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/smile.png" title="Smiling" alt="Smiling" class="smiley-content"/></p>

<p>I have a follow-up question.  How does the average person's belief that all fiends are evil (a prejudice that is not unwarranted, mind you) affect this fiend in question?</p>

<p>I would like to mention again that all are welcome to answer any questions I have posted here.  The Balance welcomes all to the table, for all are needed to create the Balance.  Even if my questions seem directed specifically to one person, if you have an idea, opinion, or belief to share, I invite you to do so without reservation.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

I want to say that I've developed that experiment fiend a bit more recently.  He has come to believe that a fiend's predisposition for evil is a restraint, and considering that most of his remembered existence was as a prisoner to the wizard, he has a big problem with restraints.  He met this Succubus who interestingly enough is a complete psychopath and combat machine.  All she likes doing is killing stuff, and maybe rolling around in the bloody remains so that she gets covered in blood and gore.  She's apparently rather prudish as well.  Needless to say, my own fiend was quite confused by this.  Later we met a human who was evil, and since we didn't end up in a fight my curious fiend started questioning her about why she was so violent and sadistic.  Eventually she got to her childhood, and she claimed that she was sent away to a military school as a child because her parents thought it was cure her of being violent and sadistic.  So basically, for all she can tell him she's a human who's naturally predisposed towards evil, who apparently didn't have a choice.  Of course he didn't accept that, but since the rest of the party was getting bored of listening to him question her about her childhood I'm not sure they'll actually get to finish the discussion.  Well to him, the idea of a human being naturally predisposed towards any alignment from birth is inconceivable because it puts into question everything he's believed in.  Because it would mean that it was possible that he didn’t have a choice either, and that whatever was done to him only forced him onto a new path.

<div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>Center of All</em> wrote:</div>I apologize on the first point for the confusion.  My intent in suggesting a greater fiend like those above was not to specify the consequences a greater fiend may face from his superiors, but rather to propose an example of a fiend that possesses numerous innate, fiend-born powers.  A creature like a quasit or a spinagon has considerably less to lose if his powers are revoked.  A glabrezu, by contrast... </div>
</p>
<p>
Ahh, now I understand clearly what you were asking.  The glabrezu in question, if it indeed was able to alter it's essence, would be noticed by the forces of good.  As has been seen in the past, the forces of good are all too eager to invite risen fiends into their realm, protecting and empowering them against their former masters.
</p>
<p>
<div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>Center of All</em> wrote:</div>Let me ask you this, then. In the hypothetical example I proposed, what
would the Primes' belief accomplish? Would it do anything at all?
Belief does have impact. However, if I understand you correctly, a
proper change takes a conscious effort on the part of the one changing.
On the other hand, in order for the fiend's essence, his core being to
rise above his evil roots, it requires not only his own belief, but the
faith of others in his goodness. Is that correct?</div>
</p>
<p>
In your example, it is my opinion that the fiend could rise by the power of the Prime's belief alone.  Whether or not this occurred is based on several factors.  The sincerity of the people in their worship and whether the fiend is aware of their worship being two important factors.  If the fiend is unaware of their worship as a god of good, he might not even notice his change in form or power.  It's possible he may wake up one day and realize that he has become a demigod to the forces of god, though more likely it will be a gradual change in which thoughts are slowly changed and his fiendish form begins to degrade and alter.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, if the fiend is aware of the Prime's worship, it would be only a minor effort on his part to shrug off the belief by believing himself to be a fiend, and therefore evil.  The reason for this is as I stated before.  You have the most power over yourself when it comes to using belief to define what you are.
</p>
<p>
This power of self-belief works in reverse as well.  A fiend that believes itself good, and is truly dedicated to the forces of good and all that they stand for, may be able to raise on its own.  I emphasize the term &quot;may&quot; as I will explain momentarily.
</p>
<p>
<div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>Center of All</em> wrote:</div>I have a follow-up question. How does the average person's belief that
all fiends are evil (a prejudice that is not unwarranted, mind you)
affect this fiend in question</div>
</p>
<p>
It is this belief, this all-encompassing belief that fiends are evil, that keeps most fiends that that happen to question themselves and their actions, don't immediately raise by their own will.  While in all but the rarest cases, the belief of another is negligible  on your own person, but in the case of multiverse wide prejudices and stereotypes, the affect is amplified to all fiends.  This is extremely detrimental to those fiends that truly wish to raise.  It may simply be impossible for them to raise through their own belief.  Perhaps they don't have the will to break through the collective belief of the multiverse.  Perhaps there is a group of primes somewhere that they had harmed in the past, thus those particular prime's belief is more focused are this particular fiend. (A possible explanation for why it is common for a fiend that is in the process of trying to raise to be required to make amends with those that it has harmed)

You all seem to assume that it's against the very nature of a fiend to rise. Is it? OK, they are physical embodiment of evil. So it would appear as they were unable to become good.
</p>
<p>
But...
</p>
<p>
Why there are so many risen villains in the literature and other forms of art? Can't you remember any cruel and selfish people who changed their ways? Or at least tried to? Weren't the main dogma of some prime religion that anyone can become good if he wants? It seems that the concept of risen evil already exists. So if the fiends represent various form of evil, nothing prevents some of them to change their ways.
</p>
<p>
What's strange is that no one seem to mind if a celestial falls. It's taken as granted when a modron goes rogue and ceases to be an exemplar of law. That's risen fiends that puzzle greybeards so much they need to make some excuses for them...

         <p>Ah, welcome to the discussion.</p>

<p>I invite you to answer your own question.  Is it against the nature of a fiend to rise?  As you said, they are the physical embodiment of evil.</p>

<p>As for the other questions you have listed, they are excellent questions indeed, but this discussion is not why there are so many in literature.  Rather, it is what can influence a fiend to rise and become good. </p>

<p>I understand your confusion on the popularity of this topic, and I will not begrudge you if you do not wish to participate.  However, fallen celestials and rogue modrons are for another discussion.  Rest assured that I, as an aurumach, do not take either of these issues any more lightly than I take a risen fiend.  I do not wish to analyze the apparent popularity of the "risen fiend."  I wish to discuss the motivations and influences that can convince a fiend to turn good.  I am not seeking excuses, I am seeking ideas.</p>

<p>I find the fallen archon that rules the city of Mal Arundak on the 403rd layer of the Abyss to be an utterly fascinating subject.  But that is neither here nor there.</p>

<p>Perhaps in another discussion I will invite everyone to consider ideas and <span style="font-style:italic">beliefs</span> on what can cause a celestial to fall or a modron to go rogue.  That discussion is not here.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

I'm sorry for that digression, but I believe it was a part of the answer. A fiend is an exemplar of evil, but what is evil if not a conception that mortals have brought to life? Of course, it's a living, thinking embodiment of this philosophical force. I don't think it could rise just by believing it to be good.The Multiverse doesn't work this way, regardless what berks from now defunct Sign of One say. Rowan Darkwood was viewed as a noble, if sometimes rude, basher who believed in hard work somewhat too much. This belief didn't prevent him from becoming a fraud, traitor and usurper, who sought to take the entire Cage at little expense and caused a bloody war. A more simple example: I can convince a group of bubbers that under my cloak I hide some delicious strawberry wine. I can even make an illusion of the bottle to make it more plausible. But will the bub magically materialize in my hand? Of course it won't. 
</p>
<p>
So if not the belief from outside, what can change the nature of a fiend? Obviously its own will could, but I don't think many fiends would be willing to try. They tend to view good beings as weaklings, fools or cowards. Many greybeards think that they can't even grasp the concept of good. It's certainly not true, given the fact that risen fiends actually do exist. But the process of becoming less vile must be similar as in the case of a mortal. It's it who decide.
</p>
<p>
And what could persuade it? Well, it can be a desire to understand his enemies. Isn't that why many celestials fall? I even believe it's the most frequent way of rising, as the unwilingness to change is the main obstacle. Fiends are masters of intrigue, so they are more than able to imagine what the other being would think.
</p>
<p>
It could be love. Of course, fiends shun this concept and consider it a weakness. And wouldn't risk assuming that love equals good. Even if a tanar'ri, yugoloth or baatezu became infatuated in somebody, it would most certainly try to resist this feeling. And the loved one is unlikely to believe his admirer. Of course even if he does, isn't it true old habits die hard? If he is a mortal, he may not survive the first manifestation of rage or jealousy. Another fiend also is not a good object of love, as the risk of betrayal skyrockets. A celestial perhaps would be the best option. Even then, the compatriots of both lovers  won't be happy to see such a relationship.
</p>
<p>
There is a possibility regret will do. However, it's very, very unlikely. I can't imagine a deed so horrible it would make a fiend repent, so I don't even consider this option.
</p>
<p>
It's theorerically possible a fiend can be made to act right. It won't make it good, but there is a possibility it may like it. Or at least consider that it's not the best fiend anyway, so maybe it's time to consider other options. It can be a defector from his camp.
</p>
<p>
But the main point is: it's the fiend who changes itself, not its surroundings or a group of mortals willing it do become good. Sign of One is dead so it's best to let their philosophy be put in the dead-book too. So why don't more fiends rise? Well, baatezu are simply too rigid to change their beliefs, once settled. Tanar'ri may consider it sometimes, but are they patient enough to not give up after a first failure? And the yugoloths... I guess they simply don't want it.

          Given your examples, it        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Given your examples, it seems you underestimate the power of <span style="font-style:italic">belief</span> on the Multiverse.  In fact, you contradict yourself quite readily.  The entire Great Wheel's existence is based on <span style="font-style:italic">belief</span>, and that existence morphs and changes according to <span style="font-style:italic">belief</span>.  <span style="font-style:italic">Belief</span> is what gives powers their awesome might.  As you yourself have stated, evil is a product of mortal <span style="font-style:italic">belief</span> and fiends are a physical manifestation of that <span style="font-style:italic">belief</span>.  Therefore, can you honestly say <span style="font-style:italic">belief</span> does not affect the Multiverse?  It does not have to be <span style="font-style:italic">belief</span> of an individual, and often is not.  But <span style="font-style:italic">belief</span> shapes planes and grants power.  Consider the factions, each of which have clerics that do not draw prayers from a power, but rather from their convictions and devotion to that faction's <span style="font-style:italic">beliefs</span>.  This is the simplest example that <span style="font-style:italic">belief</span> is quite possibly the strongest shaper of the Multiverse, greater than even the powers.  You speak of <span style="font-style:italic">belief</span> as though it were a simple magic trick.  But I am not talking about manipulation or foolery, I speak of true <span style="font-style:italic">belief</span>.  Still, that may be a discussion for another place and another time.</p>

<p>For argument's sake, I will accept that <span style="font-style:italic">belief</span> cannot change a fiend and subvert him to the powers of good.  Let me go through the examples you provide.</p>

<p>You say a fiend's own will is not likely to allow it to rise.  Fair enough.  And by saying this, it sounds as though you answer your first question.  A fiend's will does not permit it to rise, therefore it is not in a fiend's nature to rise.  Would you agree?</p>

<p>A desire to understand its enemies could also be acceptable, though would this alone make a fiend rise?  Some tomes tell tales of baatezu that infiltrate archon ranks claiming to be "risen" only to discover archon secrets and report them back to Baator.  So this alone seems inadequate.</p>

<p>Love?  Love could possibly cause a fiend to rise above his evil nature.  There is dark that claims a succubus and a celestial live together as lovers, hidden away in the depths of Karasuthra.  They each represent an accomplishment of the ultimate goal the other seeks to achieve.  She has made him fall in love with her, while he turned her from her evil ways.  But how does a fiend find love and understand what it means?</p>

<p>Forced action and conditioning could possibly achieve this.  Fall-From-Grace exemplifies this.  As a tanar'ri, she should be innately chaotic, but she was raised among baatezu as a slave.  Therefore, her existence trained her to act and think lawfully rather than as an agent of chaos and destruction.</p>

<p>I would again caution you against disregarding the power of <span style="font-style:italic">belief</span> in the Multiverse.  <span style="font-style:italic">Belief</span> does shape the planes, of that there is proof.  The Signers' philosophy is that any one person's <span style="font-style:italic">belief</span> has the power to shape the Multiverse.  The destruction of their faction is not a negation of this belief -- in fact, many Signers still exist, they simply do not call themselves Signers anymore.  Nevertheless, it is widely known that the power of <span style="font-style:italic">belief</span> is extremely prevalent on the Great Wheel.  Even elsewhere; on the Inner Planes, on the Primes.  <span style="font-style:italic">Belief</span> should not be underrated, for it drives people to many ends.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

I agree that <em>belief</em> shapes the planes. But how it works? No one seem to have a good answer. In my opinion, though, it seems to work in more subtle ways. It rather makes things possible, than make them happen. A fiend doesn't turn good because someone believe it is. It's not like someone other's belief is bending its will the exact moment there will be enough people convinced. It's sufficient that most people believe that evil can be turned good. When a fiend repents, it doesn't cease to be what it once was. It does represent just another type of evil: <em>evil redeemed</em>. 
</p>
<p>
I spoke against Signers, because I view your idea of exemplars somewhat similar to their. It seems as you considered their (even your!) free will as nonexistant, or secondary to the concept they represent. I don't want to challenge your belief, but I don't think even most exemplars would agree.
</p>
<p>
The dispute about fiend's will stopping him from becoming good is a matter of semantics. Does the fact it doesn't want to change its own nature mean it can't change its own nature? I don't think so. From its point of view, it has a choice and decides not to rise. And it's hard to tell the difference from the outside.
</p>
<p>
Your argument about infiltrators is, of course, valid. It doesn't, however, entirely refute my claim. When it decide to impersonate a risen fiend, it must learn how to think like a risen fiend. Therefore, it opens its mind for another point of view. It can reject it, of course, and many propably do. But if baatezu indoctrination fails...
</p>
<p>
As for the love, I don't think they are entirely incapable of it. It's propably hidden very deep, but it has to be there, as the rage inside the most holy of archons. After all, they are not the perfect embodiments of their concept, are they? Given the fact that all major races of fiends have their rites of promotion which purify them from unwanted traits, they are almost certainly less than perfect. And the love is credited by the mortals to blossom even in unfavorable conditions.
</p>
<p>
I believe the conditioning the least successful method, but perhaps there is some hope for it. It would be a daring and grand experiment to capture some specimens and experiment on them. Unfortunately, the fiends are quite deceptive and propably resistant. I'm afraid that the prisoner would corrupt their captors faster than they would be able to redeem it...

I agree that <em>belief</em> shapes the planes. But how it works? No one seem to have a good answer. In my opinion, though, it seems to work in more subtle ways. It rather makes things possible, than make them happen. A fiend doesn't turn good because someone believe it is. It's not like someone other's belief is bending its will the exact moment there will be enough people convinced. It's sufficient that most people believe that evil can be turned good. When a fiend repents, it doesn't cease to be what it once was. It does represent just another type of evil: <em>evil redeemed</em>. </div></p>

<p>Then I ask you this: How is evil redeemed still evil?</p>

<p>Aha, but here is where you are mistaken.  With a few exceptions, I speak in order to foster discussion, not to provide my own views.  I wish to see what others <span style="font-style:italic">believe</span>.  However, this is not the purpose of this discussion as a whole, so I will speak no further on this topic.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>The dispute about fiend's will stopping him from becoming good is a matter of semantics. Does the fact it doesn't want to change its own nature mean it can't change its own nature? I don't think so. From its point of view, it has a choice and decides not to rise. And it's hard to tell the difference from the outside.</p>

<p>Your argument about infiltrators is, of course, valid. It doesn't, however, entirely refute my claim. When it decide to impersonate a risen fiend, it must learn how to think like a risen fiend. Therefore, it opens its mind for another point of view. It can reject it, of course, and many propably do. But if baatezu indoctrination fails...</div>  </p>

<p>But of course.  What I mean to suggest is opening one's mind alone does not seem enough to fully convince a fiend to turn good.  What I asked before and ask again now is this:  What do you believe the threshold is?  If baatezu can infiltrate archons' ranks under the guise of being good, yet still return to Baator full of malice, what is the turning point, the event, the weight to tip the scales and transform the fiend from mimicking good to being good?</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>As for the love, I don't think they are entirely incapable of it. It's propably hidden very deep, but it has to be there, as the rage inside the most holy of archons. After all, they are not the perfect embodiments of their concept, are they? Given the fact that all major races of fiends have their rites of promotion which purify them from unwanted traits, they are almost certainly less than perfect.

<p>Perhaps, perhaps not.  I will say no more regarding this topic.</p>

<p>I understand your reticence in the strength of this method, but I must ask.  How would one condition a fiend?  Pain?  Many fiends are as masochistic as they are sadistic and feed off pain, even their own.  Empathy?  Could appealing to their emotions truly touch a fiend?

<p>
If I may make a suggestion on this particular approach.  I would recommend attempting to focus on the fiend's complementing alignment trait.  For example, a Tanar'ri may be kept imprisoned, restrained in both body and mind to such an extreme that it never knows freedom again.  The Tanari'ri would then be given a choice.  Willingly submit to good and be free again, or remain evil and be forever imprisoned.  The Tanar'ri, being as chaotic as it is evil, will eventually have to choose one over the other.  I estimate that half of such subjects would choose one side over the other, with the other side having made their decision, would be beyond reformation.
</p>
<p>
As a second example, take a Baatezu.  Only instead of taking away its freedom, something that it has never known to begin with, take away its purpose.  Baatezu are helpless without a purpose.  They would be trapped by their own innate need for structure and purpose.  The Baatezu would then be given the same choice as the Tanar'ri, Submit to good and be given both purpose and duty, or remain evil and never know purpose again.

Well, it sounds like paradox. It may not be evil in itself, but it is a representation of some kind of evil. Becoming good doesn't make it an exemplar of good. It doesn't usually change its form. Isn't that a proof that, while its alignment changes, its nature doesn't?

<p>
It really depends, because no two fiends are similar. It should somehow lose its faith in basic tenets of its race. For a baatezu it's not impossible. Given the fact it draws its spiritual strength from its society, its very vulnerable as a &quot;risen&quot; fiend.
</p>
<p>
How I would start its reeducation? Temporary detainment would be the first neccessary step, as no one wants it to reestablish contact with its compatriots. It's not so hard as it sounds - a fiend on Mount Celestia or Elysium is, basically, on its own. So we have a baatezu, trying to live on a plane which supports good instead of evil, with a bunch of good creatures. And, what's most important, without ever-present hierarchy, osyluths spying on it constantly, constant threat of demotion, Pit of Flame... I believe the turning moment would be when we managed to break the fiend's ambition and lust for power. It's the only thing able to sustain its evil ways: its expectation of a great reward when it finally manages to escape...
</p>
<p>
Well, doesn't it sound like a mundane conditioning? I believe there is a fundamental difference between a fiend captured and imprisoned on a foreign plane, and a fiend who goes there with its own will. Breaking it against its will isn't a great method to rise it. It will make the fiend to hate its opressors and draw strength from this hatred.

Fascinating subject I've wandered into here.
</p>
<p>
Risen fiends should be exceedingly rare. As some have mentioned, Evil is a fundamental part of their being. As outsiders, a fiend is tied to their plane of existence in ways that a mortal cannot easily comprehend. For a Baatezu, Baator is much more than home - it is a part of them as much as they dwell within it.
</p>
<p>
Because of this, I generally consider (non-risen) fiends incapable of the positive emotions such as love, charity, etc. Likewise, non-fallen celestials are incapable of hate, etc. A fiend may confuse lust with love, or look for a hidden motive when presented with a charitable act.
</p>
<p>
On the concept of (fiendish) Essence vs. Alignment: For a fiend, they are intrinsically connected. A fiend must be evil, because of their fiendish nature. 
</p>
<p>
So what would cause a fiend to rise? Two options exist: a STRONG external force (a Wish spell, some otherpotent magic) comes to mind. But that's an easy road. Personal choice is doubtful, for a fiend forced to do good, such as the baatezu saving the (future) tyrant from a rampaging dragon, always has an ulterior evil motive. Fiends can wait for centuries for their plans to come to fruition. 
</p>
<p>
So what are other ways that a fiend might be infected by goodness, and rise? In the planes, Good and Evil are material forces. But things don't always stay where they're supposed to be. In the module <em>The Deva Spark</em>, afragment of a deva's essence gets absorbed by a bebelit, IIRC. From this concept, we might find some clues.
</p>
<p>
We know that various adventurers wander into Baator to free loved ones, or venture into the Abyss to confront some powerful entity. In most cases, those good fools perish in the attempt. What happens to their souls? At times, the souls get trapped in whatever lower plane they happen to be on. Eventually, the soul of the good being is absorbed by the plane, but then it is rejected. The plane spits the goodness into a convenient host - a fiend.
</p>
<p>
Usually, the fiend is powerful and centered in itself enough to resist a minute infusion of goodness. But the seed has been planted. The fiend may start to feel strange emotions. At that point, it is no longer 'pure evil'.
</p>
<p>
Truly Risen fiends - those who are no longer evil - are technically no longer fiends. Usually a fiend will retain its physical shape, because that is part of its self-image. But as an outsider, its essence could become linked to a new plane of existence. Eventually, the fiend's appearance and abilities may change - a reformed cornugon might find its features softening, and its wings suddently sprouting feathers for instance.

          I apologize for my silence        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>I apologize for my silence recently.  When the Balance calls, it is always of the highest priority.  I'm certain you understand.</p>

<p>It is with both regret and pleasure that I say I have no further questions to pose to those of you engaging in this thread.  Regret because this discussion is turning very interesting.  Pleasure because your answers from start to finish, including your excellent commentary, Black Daggr, have helped me <span style="font-style:italic">tremendously</span> in achieving what I seek to achieve.  The results will show in due course.  And, as a matter of fact, when the time is right, I will share these results with everyone here.</p>

<p>That being said, I will continue to watch this discussion if any more ideas come up.  As the planes are ever-changing, so may my results.</p>

<p>Thank you for your time and participation.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">
