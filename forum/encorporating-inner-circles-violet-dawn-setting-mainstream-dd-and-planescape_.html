          Encorporating Inner Circle&#039;s Violet Dawn Setting into Mainstream D&amp;D and Planescape        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
        <div class="dice_rolls">
</div> <p>You've read me sing songs of praise for Violet Dawn, the exotic campaign setting by Inner Circle.  In this topic I focus on ways in which to fit the round and square pegs alike into the round Planescape holes.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">WHAT VIOLET DAWN IS</span><br />
Violet Dawn, as the authors admit themselves in the free primer, is inspired quite heavily from the Dark Sun campaign setting-- but with far heavier doses of HP Lovecraft. <br />
However, there are some key differences between the two-- <br />
1. Avadnu is a civilizational post-apocalyptic world, rather than an ecoloically post-apocalyptic world.<br />
2. The setting focuses far less on the struggle for survival.  Instead, the two primary themes are societal recovery following war-torn civilizational collapse and the consequences for the mistakes of one's forefathers and the current generation-- largely in the form of pursuing forbidden knowledge and practices (such as eugenics and evil magic)<br />
3. Unlike the Dark Sun setting, none of the standard D&amp;D races (save humans) exist in the Violet Dawn campaign setting, though many play similar ecological roles, and a few of the standard monsters still exist here *for instance, aboleth, elementals, and mephits).</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">BOOKS YOU NEED TO PLAY</span><br />
The only Violet Dawn books you actually need are the Player's Primer (free on the Inner Circle website), The Complete Book of Denizens, The Broken Isles Player's Guide, and the Broken Isles Lorebook.  The rest of the books are just earlier incarnations of the monster books.<br />
In addition, there is quite a bit of additional material available online, particularly on Obsidian Portal, where Inner Circle posted quite a bit of non-game fluff.  The links are difficult to find via search or manual browsing however, so here they are:</p>

<p>With that out of the way, here are some of the incorporations:</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">VIOLET DAWN POWERS</span><br />
There are around 14 gods in the Violet Dawn campaign setting.  Most of them fit fairly well into Planescape.  The still-remaining Gods acquire most of their divine power from descendants of members of the races who escaped Avadnu prior to the Time of Chaos.  They are as follows:</p>

<p>--Arshan: One of the twin sun gods, and patron deity of the Sulwynarii.<br />
--Cylethil: The goddess of night, secrets, and knowledge; wife of the late Morindalien.  I cannot determine her alignment, she is either NG or CN *I cannot determine her alignment because although she does a lot of good things much like Eilithea, she is also commonly worshipped by evil spellcasters who seek forbidden knowledge*<br />
--Eilithea: The remaining of the twin moon gods; she is the goddess of moon, wisdom, and hope and married to Karnn.  NG.  She shares a realm with Karnn and Narudra on the Outlands, but sometimes hangs out with Selune on her realm on Ysgard, and Selune has even provided her with her own personal area within the Gates of the Moon.<br />
--Karnn: The god of wilderness, plants, and animals.  Probably CN, but may have CG leanings.  He possesses two realms-- one on the Outlands, and the other on the Beastlands.<br />
--Krüg: Vestige; he was a deity of war, battle, and savagery, probably CN, and brother of Karnn.<br />
--Irunean: True neutral diety of time, balance, and lorekeeping who dwells on the Outlands; has taken Temulea's place as leader of the Avadnian pantheon, and his divine realm is the reformed realm of Temulea's, where he and the other Avadnian deities once resided .<br />
--Mnhill: God of earth and vegetation; probably an Avadnian appellation of Grumbar.<br />
--Morindalien: Vestige.  One of the twin moon gods; god of moon, vigilance, and courage, and patron deity of the Zeidian.<br />
--Mrand'ith:  Goddess of air and the sky; probably an Avadnian appellation of Akadi.<br />
--Narudra: Jeff Visgaitis answered with the following about her: <span style="font-style:italic">We were reworking the creation myth and we felt a goddess of nature was missing. Her information is below:<br />
Narudra, Mistress of Nature<br />
The Green Mistress, Daughter of the Wild, The Verdant Lady<br />
Narudra is ever-evolving hand of nature’s design. She breathes life into all things that spring from the soil, and by her very touch does she guide the flow of the natural world. She is seen a patient and giving mother to the living world, but though she is caring she is not without a vengeful side.</span><br />
She would be True Neutral, with possible slight good-leanings.  She shares the two realms with Karnn on the Outlands and (with Eilithea) the Beastlands.<br />
--Shanarr: One of the NG twin sun gods, and patron deity of the Sulwynarii.<br />
--Sidoneus: Neutral god of the sea.  He is probably an Avadnian appellation of Istishia.<br />
--Sha-Ul: Neutral goddess of fire.  She is probably an Avadnian appellation of Kossuth.<br />
--Temulea: Asleep/Dying.  The creator god and father of the Avadnian pantheon.  When he learned of the forbidden creation of the Sulwynarii and the imprisonment of a Mithu *noble/ascended mistji* by his children, he went into a rage.  Only Krug was crazy enough to challenge him in this state, and was slain.  This experience changed Temulea's alignment from CN to CE and he went into a deep slumber (much like Ulutiu) to escape his pain.  However, even in this state, he continued to exert his will on his children and the inhabitants of Violetspace.  His nightmares created The Void, a slightly Far-Realm-esque demiplane full of Far-Realm-like Xxyth, a race created by Temulea to undo his creation entirely.  This led to the Xxyth Wars and the fall of Sulwynarii civilization.  Temulea is currently in the Astral, slowly withering away.  His divine realm was most likely on the Outlands, and at the time housed the other 13 gods minus Vérthax, Mnhill, Mrand'ith, Sha-Ul, and Sidoneous.  This divine realm would have been badly damaged during the fight between Temulea and his children, anfd long-since repaired (but nowhere near as splendorous) by Irunean.  Temulea's remaining children have long since scattered across the Outer Planes to carve out a divine realm of their own on a plane that better suits their alignment.  <br />
It is also worth mentioning that in the Planescape and regular D&amp;D world, Temulea's origins stem from the Far Realm, but he was far more naturalized to the multiverse than most of the other Far-Realm powers who escaped during that time (such as Tharizdun, Ghaunadaur, The Patient One, and The Great Mother)<br />
--Vérthax: The god of death and darkness; he is NE and dwells on the Gray Waste, probably on the first layer.  Despite being NE, he despises the undead and deathless in the same way that Kelemvor does.  As the only evil member of the Avadnian pantheon, he is often considered separate.  In the Violet Dawn setting, Vérthax seeks vengeance on any who attempt to 'cheat' death-- namely the undead, deathless, and those brought back by resurrection magic *as well as the one who cast the spell*.  Though not an issue within the Violet Dawn setting, in the PS setting he would also, by extension, be equally opposed to cyberization or any other means of greatly prolonging the lifespan of a mortal creature by altering its physiology or age.</p>

<p>I decided that the Avadnian Elemental Lords should simply be Avadnian aspects of the Faerunian/Planescape Elemental Lords, since that would be far easier than trying to fit them on the Elemental Planes with their own realm and power struggle.  This of course would mean that four of the abovementioned powers are not literally children of Temulea.  And no, the Avadnian version of Kossuth being female is not a problem, since the Hordelands version of Akadi is a male.  </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">VIOLETSPACE</span><br />
Very little info is given on Violetspace's planetology.  All that I can determine is that Violetspace is a geocentric crystal sphere with Avadnu at the center, orbited by twin suns and (originally) twin moons *one of them was destroyed*.  Violetspace also contains a little-described celestial object called the Ulwynaarl (not to be confused with the Sulwynarii's personal amulets by the same name, which means 'spirit stone' in their language), which is the source of all magic on Avadnu, with one facet for each of the elements *and possibly for each school of magic as well*.  As far as I can tell, there is no indication as to whether or not Spelljamming into or out of the sphere is possible, and it's possible that the authors intentionally left that unaddressed.  <br />
It should be noted that there are scattered mentions that Temulea defeated someone or something that previously inhabited or owned Violetspace before he began his creations.  </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">VIOLET DAWN DEMIPLANES AND COSMOLOGY</span><br />
Violetspace was sealed off from the rest of the Multiverse beyond the Border Ethereal following the Time of Chaos (Xxyth Wars).  This was done via joint effort between Irunean, Ptah, and Celestian via the creation of the Demiplane of Doors, a plane very similar in concept to the Infinite Staircase.  The Demiplane of Doors serves three purposes:<br />
1. It separates The Void from Violetspace<br />
2. It separates Violetspace (and thus The Void) from the rest of the Multiverse<br />
3. It allows some vestige of divine energy exchange between Violetspace and the Planes.  (clerics have to take a feat in order to gain spells, though)<br />
4. It makes it nearly impossible for Tharizdun and other destruction-loving powers from making contact with the inhabitants of Avadnu, thus protecting the delicate seal on The Void.  </p>

<p>The Void is a demiplane coterminous within the crystal sphere of Violetspace.  I already mentioned its origin and purpose when discussing Temulea.  Celestian and Ptah worked in conjunction with Irunean to seal it off from the rest of the Multiverse.<br />
Initially they attempted to seal it off from the Multiverse completely, but Temulea's will prevents the conduit between The Void and Violetspace from being sealed permanently.  Today, owing in part to Temulea's will and in part to permanent damage dealt to reality within Violetspace, the combined seals of Irunean's, Ptah's, and Celestia's divine energies are barely enough to keep condiut between Violetspace and The Void sealed.  Should Tharizdun somehow manage to corrupt or weaken this seal (which is indeed a goal of his), the seal would fail, and the voidspawn would pour out into Violetspace once again.<br />
This threat, combined with the failure of Avadnu's morals to completely annihilate ALL of the voidspawn that flooded the planet during The Time of Chaos, lead to the painful decision of sealing the Crystal Sphere off from the rest of the multiverse.</p>

<p>Like the Demiplane of Dread, Violetspace is (oddly enough) also coterminous with a number of dream curtains/dreamscapes.  Also, it appears that not only can Inner Planar creatures be summoned by casters, but they can planeshift to and from Avadnu on their own, as well.  Though interestingly enough, Elemental Primals are unable to enter Avadnu and are stuck inside the Ulwynaarl until they planeshift back.<br />
However, the Great Wheel appears to be entirely cut off from Violetspace, with the only conduit linking the two together being the Demiplane of Doors.  It's likely that the Demiplane of Doors connects to the Infinite Staircase rather than to sites on the Great Wheel directly.<br />
Violetspace, like all crystal spheres, is coterminous with the Border Ethereal, but Violetspace's Border Ethereal is surrounded by a mysterious, completely impenetrable barrier made from some unknown substance or energy *one who observes or divines the substance cannot determine which*, erected long ago by Ptah.  This barrier cannot be destroyed, penetrated, passed, or altered by anything less than an Intermediate power.</p>       </div>

          Re: Encorporating Inner Circle&#039;s Violet Dawn Setting into ...        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><span style="font-weight:bold">QUICK GLOSSARY OF VIOLET DAWN TERMS</span><br />
The links use these terms extensively, and I'll probably use some of them when discussing the races.  (They're also used extensively in the books. Sadly, the Violet Dawn setting is not entirely complete-- that is, the game is quite playable and complete in that respect, but there are fluffy bits and the like which are casually mentioned but never described in fuller detail)</p>

<p>--Arc: A unit of time in the Violet Dawn setting, which appears to be equivalent to a century.<br />
--Children of the Suns: This is the term used in Broken Isles human oral history for the Sulwynaari.<br />
--Cycle: A unit of time in the Violet Dawn setting, which appears to be equivalent to a year.<br />
--Daegir: The Daegir was a powerful artifact created by Temulea's 13 children by imprisoning a powerful Mistji inside and siphoning its essence to tap Temulea's creative powers-- power which was far beyond anything the 13 children could match.  This power was used, among other things, to create the Sulwynarii race.<br />
When Temulea learned of this betrayal, he flew into a rage and wrought destruction across the heavens.  Temulea's 13 children cast the daegir to Avadnu in a desperate attempt to halt any further destruction.  However, in their hastiness, they failed to notice that Morindalien, the twin moon god of vigilance, was unable to move out of the way in time-- the daegir tore through him, destroying the celestial body and thus slaying the god.  <span style="font-style:italic">(note: that is prettymuch non-verbatim to what the book says; I don't know how to explain that in Planescape terms.)</span><br />
--The Deep: The Avadnian term for their Underdark.<br />
--The Sealing: Term I have coined for when Avadnu was sealed away from the planes by Irunean, Ptah, and Celestian.<br />
--Stormkin: This is the term used in Broken Isles human oral history for the Mistji.<br />
--Time of Chaos: The war with the Voidspawn, incarnations of Temulea's wrath.  It ended 5000 years ago with the sealing away of Violetspace and the collapse of all civilizations on Avadnu.<br />
--Ulwynaarl: Jeff Visgaitis (creative director) gave the following answer in his email:<br />
<span style="font-style:italic">The Ulwynaarl is the core of the planet Avadnu. It's a solid crystal and the first object that Temulea made which gave the universe light. The crystals that the sulwynarri use are pieces of the core that work there way up to the surface of the planet. I realized there was some confusion with this, so in the new creation myth I renamed the core Gir and got rid of Ulwynaarl altogether. So then Daegir makes more sense as it means "lesser" Gir. I'll send you the updated creation myth once it's done.</span>  On other Violet Dawn sources (such as IIRC the website page with the taint rules), it is stated that the crystalline core is made from Nysaril crystal (a special type of crystal capable of absorbing and purifying taint)<br />
--War of the Daegir: When the Daegir fell, the nations and races of Avadnu rushed to claim it, and went to war with one another to claim it as a spoil.  The Time of Chaos interrupted the war, as the Voidspawn crawled out of Avadnu's oceans to make war with all creation.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">VIOLET DAWN RACES</span><br />
These are some short notes on how to encorporate them into the Planescape setting, plus a short definition of what they are.  I've added corrections to some of the racial traits since Inner Circle's ability mods + 0LA for several races is a bit loopy.<br />
--Agraukith: A usually N race of insectile monstrous humanoids who combine physical traits of many real-world insects (including bees, spiders, and beetles).  Their behavior and outlook is extremely similar to that of lizardfolk, though they are not religious.<br />
--Arageld: A race of often N, mechanically *clockwork* inclined aquatic avians who "fell from grace" and were punished by Mrand'iith *Akadi* and Arshan *twin sun god* by being stripped of their feathers and cast into the sea.  Aragelds worship both gods along with Sidoneus *Istishia*.  <br />
--Dark Wanderer: A LE race of gypsy/caravan-like nomadic monstrous humanoids with an unbelievable level of gender dimorphism (that is, the males and females look REALLY different).  The males are 10-15 ft. tall reptilian humanoids while the females look almost human *they can also switch gender*.  Females use their seductive qualities *including exotic danging* to lure travelers into their camps, where they are mesmerized, killed, and then dined upon by the tribe.  Though little is known about the race, it is known that the predominant religion on Gehenna is the cult of the General of Gehenna, *with the domains of Evil, Trickery, Knowledge, and War available to clerics* while on Stygia it is, of course, the cult of Levistus.<br />
Colonies of Dark Wanderers can be found in the more hospitable areas of Gehenna; tiny scattered colonies can also be found on Stygia.  In the Planescape setting, Dark Wanderers speak infernal and common.<br />
--Igran-Krider: A usually N mysterious race of Underdark-indigenous lorekeeping humanoids with natural bioluminescence.  They communicate through pulses of colored light, a secret ceremonial language of "living sound", and understand *but do not normally speak* undercommon.  They lack a written language and consider it culturally taboo.   PC Igran-Kriders are capable of speaking normal languages.  Small colonies exist on the Elemental Plane of Earth as well as large underground complex layers and regions on the Outer Planes.  The largest colonies are found on Earth and within Underdark caverns on the Outlands.<br />
The original Igran Krider colonies arrived on the Inner and Outer planes accompanying the Zeidian.<br />
--Mistji: A race of usually LN humanoids *and one of the main 4 races of the Violet Dawn setting*, who were the first sentient mortal race born on Avadnu, created by Temulea himself as he dreamed of the perfect being.  They are masters of magic (much like gold/high elves), lovers of nature, and coldly self-sufficient. *note: racial adjustments should be +2 rather than +4 Int.  Despite possessing spell-like abilities similar to a Drow's, they retain a +0 LA due to racial penalties for physical combat and weapon familiarity.*  Most Mistji colonies live on Arcadia, the Beastlands, or Celestia, and migrated shortly after the fall of the Daegir.<br />
--Naralskin: Essentially, a race of usually N furries (anthropomorphs) who fill the ecological niche of lycanthrope on Avadnu.  Creations of Karnn and Eilithea, they are found mostly on the Outlands and Beastlands.<br />
--Ngakoi: A race of usually N, green-skinned, hairless, 3-eyed semi-nomadic humanoids.  One of the 4 main races in the Violet Dawn setting, they are more amicable towards aberrations *including Xxyth and Far-Realm ones, which they treat no differently from natural creatures* than other races, and likely owe their origins to the Time of Chaos (see Other Terms below), though they appear to be mostly naturalized.  Many races, particularly those that revere nature (such as elves, sulwynarii, and mistji) shun the Ngakoi due to their propensity to delve into "forbidden" power sources, such as The Void and the Far Realm.<br />
In the Planescape setting, Ngakoi colonies are almost entirely limited to Bytopia, where they spend 6 months of each year on one layer.<br />
--Skarren: A usually N red-skinned race created from Krug's spilled blood when he was slain by Temulea.  Colonies are likely to be found in decent number on Ysgard and the Outlands, and participate WILLINGLY in the Blood War for sport.  The behavior of Skarren colonies among the planes is slightly different-- as such worlds necessitate, the planar Skarren are more cautious about who and what they fight, knowing that they must pick their battles wisely.  For this reason, planar Skarren are much more given to parleying with races and groups who share similar goals to theirs rather than outright challenging anything that moves to a duel to the death or to the blood.  Skarren are found in greatest numbers on Ysgard and Acheron, with other common sightings on lower planar layers most often used as battlefields in the Blood War such as Oinos on the Gray Waste.<br />
The fiendish races generally avoid conscripting the Skarren, knowing that doing so would only cause them to turn on their conscriptors, besides that, the Skarren hardly need incentives to join the Blood War.  However, the fiendish races do take measures to ensure that the Skarren are discouraged from turning on their employers before their contract is up.<br />
Skarren-- or at least those of the Ysgard colony, tend to be on decent to grudging terms with Bariaur.  Though most Skarren do not care for the Baraiaur's pursuit of good, and the Baraiaur view the Skarren as somewhat evil and too savage, both respect one another's love for battle and travel.<br />
Like their Avadnian cousins, the planar Skarren are usually neutral, though most gravitate towards chaos (even those with True Neutral alignment gravitate towards chaos), and quite a few gravitate towards good or evil (most native-born Skarren on Ysgard gravitate towards good)<br />
--Sulwynarii: I covered this entirely (and extensively) in the "Let's Brainstorm" topic.<br />
--Urgelds: A land-dwelling subrace of aragelds.  They are bandits who live on islands and coastal caverns.  <br />
--Vanthiir: A degenerate CE race of former Sulwynaari transformed into bloodthirsty savages through an unholy ritual cast long ago.  Vanthiir can be found on the chaotically-aligned lower planes, particularly the Abyss and Carceri.  Few are encountered in Sigil due to their aversion to civilization.<br />
--Xiir: A usually N race of powerful but hideous-looking lamia-like psionicists in severe decline due to the Time of Chaos followed by a self-destructive eugenics program that resulted in severe inbreeding.  <br />
They were originally created by a power known as the Great Wyrm Gynnuroth, who is a member of the Draconic pantheon, naturally.  The decline in their civilization began when Temulea's children marred the faces of the race in order to limit Gynnuroth's influence on their creations.  This led the Xiir to their disastrous eugenics program. <br />
Their numbers are few even in Planescape, where the majority are derranged inbreds *usually CN or CE*.  Only a few hundred non-derranged Xiir exist in the Planescape setting.<br />
--Xiir, Ginnean: The Xiir individuals who escaped the punishment of the gods by hiding in the Demiplane of Ectoplasm. Their bodies have been greatly altered by the millenia spent on the demiplane.  (note: the actual book does not specify the name of the demiplane, but the Demiplane of Ectoplasm is very much assumed-- for the unaware, the crunch on the Demiplane of Ectoplasm can be found on Wizards's website)  <br />
--Zeidian: A chaotic-good leaning race of protectors who worship Eilithea and (formerly) Morindalien.  They play a similar ecological role to dwarves on Avadnu, though they do not match the crafting abilities the dwarves are famous for, and are not short in stature.  In the Planescape Setting, descendents of planewalking Zeidian colonies are most often found on Arborea, Ysgard, and the Elemental Plane of Earth.  On Arborea, they are allied with the Eladrin.  The two races don't always get along, since the Eladrin view liberation and freedom as the most important thing, while the Zeidian view protection, vigilance, and security as the most important thing.  On Ysgard they tend to work with the Bariaur, who also tend to argue over whether destroying evil or protecting the innocent from it is more important.  At the same time, both Eladrin and Bariaur respect the Zeidian.  The Eladrin realize that the Zeidian are fierce protectors of freedom (oppression is one of the things the Arborean Zeidian seek to protect the innocent from), and the Bariaur recognize the Zeidian's savagery against wickedness in its many forms.<br />
--Zha'lari: Lizardmen of the desert, the Zha'lari, like their better-known counterparts, focus on survival, but are NE.  Nonetheless, most in the Planescape setting are likely to worship Set.  </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">VIOLET DAWN MONSTERS</span><br />
The following monsters are usable in a Planescape setting.<br />
--Alaihar: Good aligned bird-like dragons.  Some alaihar can be found on Elysium and Celestia.<br />
--Crystal Reflector: An animal native to the Forest of Waethe which acquires nourishment by absorbing sunlight into its crystalline carapace. The original Sulwynaari colonies took these with them to the Quasielemental Plane of Mineral and some of the upper planes.  Reflectors on these planes possess whatever immunities to the environment are needed (e.g. positive energy resistance and petrification immunity on Mineral).<br />
--Argill: Aquatic humanoids with black, amphibian-like skin.  They steal the breath from air-breathing swimmers from a distance.  Some of these can likely be found in Carceri.<br />
--Aszevara: This template can be encountered among sentient mortal creatures on any non-good aligned plane, non-sentient mortal creatures on the lower planes, and is particularly suited for the Ravenloft campaign setting (Demiplane of Dread).  <br />
--Beasthound: These can be found on the Grey Waste, and are a favored minion of Verthax.<br />
--Bhorloth: As an animal, they can be found on the Beastlands.  As a beast of burden, they are available in Sigil.  On Violet Dawn, they are associated with humans.<br />
--Black Water Slough: These creatures are from a bygone era of Elder Evils; they arose shortly after the Aboleth, and may or may not be one of their creations *probably not*<br />
--Boil Spore: Mundane oozes found on fire-dominant Inner Planes *esp. Fire and Magma*, Gehenna, etc.<br />
--Braershoot: Floating trees with massive bioluminescent float-bladders.  Likely to be found in small colonies in particularly exotic areas of the Beastlands, Arborea, the Elemental Plane of Air, and the Quasielemental Plane of Steam.  Braershoots are one of the most common Vivacious Creature plants; Radiant and Lightning creature Braershoots are also among the more common plants of those respective templates.<br />
As you might expect, braershoots on Avadnu are a rare species in rapid decline since they're popular targets for archers to practice on, and their luminescent air bladders make them easy to spot.<br />
--Bygone Creature template: Spirits of extinct creatures, particularly of species that were wiped out as a result of genocide or a natural, supernatural, or man-made cataclysm.  They are mere 'shadows' of the species, so they're actually much weaker than would be a ghost of such creatures.  Though it was designed with the Avadnian God-Beasts in mind *epic level monsters fairly similar to Monsters of Legend* it's actually pretty generic, so it can be found absolutely anywhere, including on any Prime.  <br />
--Carcaetan: Associated with Verthax, obviously, so they'd be found primarily on Oinos.  The concept of this monster (gaining a quality of creatures it's eaten a lot of upon advancing with enough HD) is actually pretty cool.<br />
--Centioch: As a mundane vermin (animal), of course they'd be found on the Beastlands, and Elemental creature versions can be found on Earth-dominant Inner Planes.<br />
--Dreadspire: These aberrations are awesome and defy description.  Specimens-- even colonies can be found within the divine realms of some evil sea + storm deities, such as Umberlee.<br />
--Droth'yar: These animals sound as though they are related to the cynodonts and other proto-mammals.  Obviously they'd be found on the Beastlands, and probably in regions associated with extinct Permian-analogue creatures.<br />
--Duogoth: Another animal used as a beast of burden, but also found wild and hunted by hunter-gatherer societies.  Like the Droth'yar, it appears to be a proto-mammal, thus should have the same ecology.<br />
--Glamwing: These beautiful creatures are likely to be found on the Beastlands as well as Arborea.<br />
--Goldencrest: These oozes can be found on the Positive Energy Plane and on Quasielemental Steam.  They can also be found in the River Oceanus and other large water bodies on the upper planes.<br />
--Elemental Swarm: For the most part, these creatures are obsoleted by elementite swarms.<br />
--Hexachaela: Mundane animals (vermin), the hexachaela can naturally be found on the Beastlands.<br />
--Kehtor: A feline closely related to the smilodon.  Beastlands, clearly.<br />
--Kei-Ehri: The original colonies of Sulwynaari brought these with them to the Quasielemental Plane of Mineral and some of the upper planes.  On mineral, they adapted quickly, and the current descendents possess the Positive Energy subtype and are immune to petrification (+1 to CR)<br />
--Khalor: A small number of them can be found on Carceri.<br />
--Kormes: (Violet Fungus adapted for Violet Dawn) A close relative of the Violet Fungus which glows phosphorescent green and is far less aggressive.  It's possible that Kormes exists on other prime worlds and planes where Violet Fungus has not taken over, but it's probably extinct on any world where its mutated cousin is widespread.  Perhaps kormes is, in fact, the natural ancestor to the violet fungus.<br />
--Kulumar: Tentacle-covered blue-skinned humanoid aberrations native to the Plane of Shadow.<br />
--Lumina: A subtype of creature native to one of the planes of the Far Realm multiverse.  They play the role of celestials in the Violet Dawn campaign setting, even though they are mysterious, and their concept of good somewhat alien to ours.  Lumina rarely enter our multiverse willingly or intentionally, and those who end up doing so live lives wracked in agony.<br />
--Mokara: Animals who fill the ecological niche of horses.  Of course they're found on the Beastlands and for sale in Sigil, and probably on other planes as well.<br />
--Necromercer: An outsider race native to the Gray Waste. They display Nighthag-like behavior, and are divine servants of Verthax.<br />
--Planar Grimalkin: These creatures would be indigenous to the Outlands, but can be found hunting for food on any Outer Plane.  Sometimes, they also go to a Prime world to hunt.<br />
--Stalssein: Probably a close relative of the piercer and the darkmantle.<br />
--Straga: Freakish NE aberrations with vertical maws that live underground.  They can be found on Gehenna.<br />
--Time Walker: Obviously these would be associated with time travel.  So use them at your own risk. (though they'd also be associated with Irunean and other powers of time)<br />
--Valikir: A gigantic bird of prey.  Found wild in the Beastlands.  Some creatures use them as mounts; they are available as exotic mounts on Sigil.<br />
--Voidspawn: A subtype of creature native to the demiplane known as The Void (see Temulea under Powers for more info).  In thre Violet Dawn campaign setting, Voidspawn play the role of fiendish races AND Farspawn.  They should not be found outside of the Violet Dawn campaign setting.<br />
--Wraithlight: A type of deathless native to Radiance-- they are the souls of non-native creatures driven mad by the storms of color before succumbing to them.  Obviously, you'd need to change their stats a bit.<br />
1. Give it the Fire and Extraplanar subtypes<br />
2. Change its type to Deathless.  <br />
3. Incorporeal Touch inflicts 1d8 fire damage.  <br />
4. Wraithlights are immune to prismatic and light effects (such as Color Spray and Flashburst).<br />
5. Ecology: Wraithlights are the souls of travelers who died under the Quasielemental Plane's effects.  Their affinity for confusion and misleading is due to the insanity they were overwhelmed with (due to the plane's assault of colors) before their deaths.  This ecology need not interfere with that of Avadnu at all, since the Violet Dawn books don't allude to anything meaningful in the Wraithlight's ecology beyond that they are probably the souls of primordial Avadnu beings</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>I wonder if, similar to Dark Sun and Krynn, there is a challenge in incorporating the setting into Planescape without fundamentally changing it. All three worlds feel like they are a closed system - the plots don't work as well if people can up and leave or find new gods to worship.</p>

<p>That said, I can see this being an exciting world for planewalkers to visit, perhaps after crossing through the Far Realms into a new cosmology.</p>

<p>I like your take on the monsters as well though I'm still going through it. </p>

<p>I'd love to hear more about the Daegir and the xxyth as well. </p>

<p>I like the origin story as one hypothesis, but I rarely like to have too much awareness regarding creation stories. Still, that is a cool one, as it makes the gods themselves guilty of hubris and almost damning creation as a result.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>It's not as difficult to encorporate as Dark Sun and Dragonlance are; the author states both in one of the books and in a topic on EN World that he intentionally wrote it in a way that it was open-ended enough to be easily encorporated into a setting like Planescape and the like.  Some of the origin stories for SRD monsters in Complete Book of Denizens is contradictory to the main canon, but it can easily be ignored.  </p>

<p>It is true that the Violet Dawn setting is a closed system due to being sealed off from the Outer Planes, but the Demiplane of Doors was made intentionally for the purpose of reaching the Great Wheel and other prime worlds (as well as the possibility of time travel)</p>

<p>It's also interesting that the books use the term "Elemental Lords" (the term used for Faerun's 4 elemental gods), but never specifies who they are, leaving the DM with the option of either assigning that title to the 4 Avadnian elemental gods or assigning the title to someone else.</p>

<p>I would not place Avadnu in the Far Realm cosmology-- from the description given in the books, it's quite clear that Avadnu is a Prime world *besides, Avadnu isn't even remotely weird enough to belong to the Far Realm.  Even The Void isn't weird enough for that*.  Instead, I tied Temulea with the Far-Realm (having escaped way back in antiquity with Ghaunadaur, Tharizdun, The Great Mother, and The Patient One), but that he was almost entirely naturalized to our multiverse, thus explaining the weirdness of his and his childrens' creations (as well as the appearance of the Voidspawn and Void)</p>

<p>The vast majority of what I have posted here is little different from what is stated in the books, with the exception of the Lumina homeworld.  Additional info was added in many areas to tie it with Planescape, but much of that is either open-ended or implied anyway in the books.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><span style="font-weight:bold">RUNNING A VIOLET DAWN CAMPAIGN WITH PLANESCAPE</span><br />
Obviously, there would be few reasons to do this, and it should be done with caution, but adventure seeds could include:<br />
--Characters acquire a mysterious mapscroll in Sigil which is actually a map showing how to reach Violetspace by travelling through the Infinite Staircaise into the Demiplane of Doors.  <br />
--Timekeepers or other servants of Irunean approach the NPCs with a quest that requires them to enter Violetspace<br />
--The PCs begin as Violet Dawn campaign setting characters, and stalk a Planar Grimalkin through the Demiplane of Doors, through the Infinite Staircase, and wind up on the Outlands.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">CLASSES AVAILABLE IN VIOLET DAWN</span><br />
Though regular bards do occur, they are extremely rare on Avadnu outside the cities.  The vast majority of bards found on Avadnu are Divine Bards (as shown in Unearthed Arcana and UA SRD)<br />
Clerics are not normally available, though there was supposed to be an exception in an upcoming rulebook that never saw its release.  In all likelihood, clerics must take a feat at first level in order to acquire spells and other class abilities.  The devote base class is given on the Inner Circle website as an alternative to the cleric.  <br />
Druids, rangers, and paladins are fairly common on Avadnu, as are fighters and barbarians.  Wizards are extremely rare and not normally available to PCs-- they can be found in certain capital cities and among some Sulwynaari, but that's it *this is due primarily to the rarity of literacy*.  People who want to become arcane casters are prettymuch limited to sorcerer.<br />
Psionics among intelligent races are fairly rare on Avadnu, but all the psionic classes do exist, including those from Complete Psionic.<br />
The additional classes should also be available:<br />
--Favored Soul: Favored souls tend to be rare individuals born with the blessing of one or more of the gods.  Unlike clerics, they do not need to take a special feat in order to cast divine spells, since it is more of an innate ability.  <br />
--Hexblade: Hexblades might be available as urban NPCs.  Alternatively, they might be more widely available as a Taint-related class (yes, the Violet Dawn setting does use Taint rules from Rokugan and Heroes of Horror, though they are optional and not an inalienable factor of the setting.)<br />
--Scout: It goes without saying that scouts will be pretty common on Avadnu, among all races.<br />
--Shaman: The OA shaman is available here.  Like their OA counterparts, they generally play the traditional role of tribal shaman or aesthetic hermit.<br />
--Spirit Shaman: Spirit shamans are pretty common, and generally play the traditional role of tribal shaman or aesthetic hermit.<br />
--Swashbuckler: Swashbucklers are pretty common among seafaring caravans, exp. among the Vylar, but that should go without saying.  Some Sulwynaari also become swashbucklers.<br />
--Alternative paladins found in Unearthed Arcana and Dragon Magazine 312 are about as common as regular paladins.<br />
--Warlock: Though extremely rare, warlocks would be available on Avadnu.  Many are likely to be descended from the Xxyth, however.  Others may be descended from elementals, or children of arcanists or priests who dabbled in forbidden lore.  Warlocks might only be available in association with taint levels.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">APPROPRIATE POWERS FOR VIOLET DAWN</span><br />
The following are additional (foreign) gods and quasipowers that can be found in small cults among Avadnians.<br />
--Archomentals: Awareness and worship of all the princes and princesses of elemental evil, good, and neutrality (i.e. Crystalle) can be found on Avadnu.  For instance, a few Sulwynaari worship Crystalle, especially in the Forest of Waethe, where contact with Quasielementals occurs far more often.  Worship of the eight primary archomentals is heavily frowned upon in most Avadnian societies (at least among those aware of it), as both the good and evil princes are viewed as enemies of the Elemental Lords.  Unlike on Oerth, worship of the Princes of Elemental Evil is not associated with worship of the Elder Elemental Eye, whose cult does not exist on Avadnu.  Worship of archomentals is not as common on Avadnu as it is on most Prime worlds.  Whereas on most primeworlds an archomental's cult ranks at around a few hundred, on Avadnu they only rank at a few dozen.<br />
--Tharizdun: The Time of Chaos did not go unnoticed in the multiverse, and among those who watched enthusiastically was Tharizdun.  Though it has been extremely difficult to do so thanks to The Sealing, Tharizdun has managed to contact several individuals in a few of the Xxyth cults, whispering to them now and then.  Of those who have received his messages, most have converted to his worship.  Tharizdun wishes very much to see The Void rip open again, and better yet, spread across all the Multiverse.  Thus, he advises the cultists, aiding them in their original goal to set the Voidspawn free once again.  Because of the Xxyth cultists, Tharizdun found no need to introduce the cult of the Elder Elemental Eye.  Tharizdun is also worshiped by many Xxyth and half-xxyth.  </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">OTHER MONSTERS APPROPRIATE FOR A VIOLET DAWN CAMPAIGN</span><br />
In addition to the SRD monsters listed as appropriate in Complete Book of Denizens (they forgot to mention aboleth BTW, which is mentioned in an adventure seed), the following creatures are appropriate for a violet dawn campaign:<br />
--Aerial Servant: Like invisible stalkers, aerial servants are employed as guardians of Waethe's forest edges by the Sulwynaari.<br />
--Caller In Darkness: Generally found on sites that were battlefields, particularly former battlefields from the Time of Chaos.<br />
--Corruption Eater: On Avadnu, these were magically created to battle the Xxyth during the Time of Chaos, and most of the traits the creature possesses were intentional, except for the Tainted Exhalation.  However, these creatures proved too difficult to control and ended up attacking allies and objects affected by the voidspawns' taint, so any attempt to mass-produce them was abandoned.  Breeding true, Corruption Eaters can still be found in many areas of Avadnu, though only near and within areas of taint sufficient enough to sustain them.<br />
--Crysmal: Crysmals can be found in the Forest of Waethe.  They generally get along well with the Sulwynaari and other creatures living there.<br />
--Swarm, Crystal Beetle (Wizards website: <a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/mm/20030516a" title="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/mm/20030516a">http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/mm/20030516a</a>) These creatures are found in the Forest of Waethe, where they mostly feed on crystal tree and crystal reflector detritus, filling an important ecological niche.  Unlike their normal counterparts, Waethian Crystal Beetles only attack fleshy creatures that are sick or badly injured.  The Sulwynaari know the means for preserving the shells and turning them into jewelry.<br />
--Elemental Creature, Any: Like elementals, these can be found from time to time in their appropriate environments.  Mineral quasielemental creatures can be found in the Forest of Waethe.<br />
--Elemental, Storm: As the other elementals, etc.<br />
--Elemental, Taint: These creatures exist both within The Void and also spawn spontaneously in areas of severe taint.<br />
--Elemental Weird, Any: Far less common on Avadnu than they are on most other primes, but they can be found in their appropriate habitat.<br />
--Entombed: found in appropriate regions<br />
--Folugub: Scattered across various areas of Avadnu.  Sulwynaari consider them an abomination and will attack them viciously on-sight, especially in and around the Forest of Waethe area; most crystalline creatures living in the Forest of Waethe innately fear the Folugub and its scent .  Inul humans greatly fear them and will also do their utmost to destroy any they find.  Folugubs most likely ended up on Avadnu accidentally via the use of some manner of forbidden magic or psionics.<br />
--Magma Hurler: associated mainly eith volcanos, but also found as war slaves among some citystates<br />
--Mephit, Any: The mephits from Denizens of the Inner Planes and Sandstorm fit quite well in their appropriate ecology.<br />
--Ooze, Any: The book states that ANY ooze is appropriate for the setting.  Obviously this would not include ones with very specific histories (e.g. a species created in a lab of Netheril)<br />
--Paraelemental, Any: Like elementals, paraelementals can be found in their appropriate areas.<br />
--Quasielemental, Any: Like elementals, quasielementals can be found in their appropriate areas.<br />
--Quasielemental, Mineral: Many mineral quasielementals can be found in the Forest of Waethe (which, if you also encorporate Eberron rules, may be a manifest zone to the Quasielemental Plane of Mineral or to the positive + quasielemental planes in general).  The Sulwynaari of Avadnu view the mineral quasielementals as sacred spirits and revere them; it is strictly taboo to slay one, even in self-defense.  The mineral quasielementals of the Forest of Waethe generally get along well with the Sulwynaari and other inhabitants of the forest, but often react with hostility to other sentient races.<br />
--Thunderspiker (<a href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/fw/20050211a" title="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/fw/20050211a">http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/fw/20050211a</a>) Highly appropriate for the setting.  They should be found in the same regions as Braershoots and Mu Spores.<br />
--Tlalusk: found where appropriate.  Likely hunted by Skarren.<br />
--Udoroot: found in temperate forests in some regions.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">OTHER CREATURES APPROPRIATE FOR THE VIOLET DAWN SETTING</span><br />
A few real-life modern animals exist in the setting (such as wolves and hawks).  Looking at the animals, it is clear to me that non-mammalian therapsids (e.g. cynodonts) are still extant on Violet Dawn, so the cynodont, gorgonopsid, therapsid, and dicynodont monsters from the EN World Creature Catalogue are quite appropriate.<br />
Other missing-link species appear to be extant as well, such as the labyrinthodonts.</p>

<p>The following creatures are NOT appropriate for a Violet Dawn Campaign:<br />
--Any Outer Planar race; Modrons, devils, demons, 'loths, eladrin, angels, archons, slaad, rilmani, hordlings, guardinals, etc.  None of these races have ever stepped foot on Avadnu, for whatever strange reason (at least not since Temulea has been around), and they most certainly have not made or attempted contact since The Sealing.  <br />
--Dragons of any kind; In the Violet Dawn campaign setting, the dragons were godbeasts, which have mostly gone extinct.  While there are creatures DESCENDED from true dragons, such as the Alaihar, no such creatures exist on Avadnu.  <br />
--Non-approved aberration races; the aberrations listed as approrpiate in Complete Book of Denizens are the only sentient ones that should be added.  Illithids, Neogi, Beholders, etc. aren't appropriate for the setting.  <br />
--Elves, Dwarves, Halflings, Gnomes, or Drow: These races never existed on Avadnu, and would only exist in the form of adventuring PCs who found their way through the Demiplane of Doors.<br />
--Goblinoids: Ditto.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

          Repost of Sulwynaari adaption material from the Brainstorm topic        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><span style="font-weight:bold">THE STORY OF THE SULWYNARII</span><br />
Millenia ago, the Sulwynaari Empire rose on their now-forgotten homeworld.  It was shortly before that time that Sulwynaari planewalkers made their way to the Quasielemental Plane of Mineral.  When they came upon the ioun stones of the Gemfields, they decided to cultivate the minerals themselves.  Crystalle's minions took exception to this and attacked.  Many of these Sulwynaari were killed, but some were successful in fending off their assailants.  Those minions who failed reported back to Crystalle, who was quite angered, though he had noted a very low fatality rate among his sentries who fought these invaders-- in fact, most of the accounts he had been given seemed to suggest that these invaders held some sort of aversion to seriously harming his minions.  <br />
Eventually, Crystalle sent a regiment against these interlopers, tasked with capture instead of extermination.  They succeeded in bringing more than a dozen Sulwynaari to Crystalle's throne room for questioning.  However, when these Sulwynaari gazed upon Crystalle's visage, they immediately and voluntarily fell prostrate in reverence, proclaiming that they were surely in the presence of a god.  Realizing that Crystalle was the owner of the crystals they had taken control over (due mostly to chastisement and comments from their captors during the trip to Crystalle's stronghold), they apologized for their actions.  Crystalle was shocked by their reaction-- and he could tell that their reaction was genuine and not mere acting.  He had them explain why they took control of his gems, to which they replied that the cultivation of crystals and gems was simply their way.  They described their homeworld, the living crystals which grow in forests like trees, and the significance of crystalline minerals-- both natural and synthetic-- to their culture.  They also explained that they had absolutely no wish to harm creatures as beautiful as Crystalle's quasielemental patrols.  <br />
Intrigued, Crystalle decided to strike a bargain with them-- they could have free access to his plane, and would even get a small portion of the crystal harvest *he made sure to articulate that this was a VERY generous offer*, in exchange for their servitude.  This servitude would be voluntary of course-- the Sulwynaari are free to refuse to work for him, but those who do not also will not be rewarded.  The Sulwynaari graciously, and with much gratitude, agreed to this proposal.  The tiny colonies under his employment also established a cult dedicated to him.  Crystalle Several centuries later, the Sulwynaari homeworld was struck with disaster.  The Sulwynaari numbers on the Quasielemental plane initially swelled, though immigration quickly dwindled to a near-halt.  Eventually it stopped altogether.  Crystalle does not know where the Sulwynaari homeworld lies (In the early days of their service, Crystalle does recall that they told him the name of their home several times, though he has long since forgotten its name, and all knowledge of the Sulwynaari homeworld was lost among the race millennia ago)  Crystalle assumes, due to the long standing lack of Prime-Sulwynaari immigration, that the homeworld was either destroyed or sealed off from the Multiverse thousands of years ago.  <br />
Sulwynaari culture on Mineral is similar to that on Avadnu, but also very different.  The Sulwynaari tradition of ulwynaarl continues on Mineral, but the story of its origins as well as its rationale has drastically changed.  The practice is identical to that on Avadnu, but the stone binds the individual's essence with the Quasielemental Plane of Mineral itself, and connecting him or her to the plane's energies.  The rationale behind this practice is that, upon reaching adulthood, a Sulwynaari seeks out and crafts an ulwynaarl to symbolize the ancient pact made with Crystalle and the Mineral Quasielementals.  The ulwynaarl embodies their oath to serve Crystalle and is an allegory of the bond between Sulwynaari and Quasielemental.  Many Sulwynaari also have their ulwynaarl attuned in a way *usually by a high priest* so as to ensure that their essence merges with Crystalle himself upon their death (since Crystalle is not an actual deity, he lacks petitioners, and cultists can only merge with him-- in the style that petitioners merge with their deity-- by pledging their soul to him.  This rule holds true for all cultists of quasipowers.)  Though by default, the ulwynaarl is simply attuned to the plane in a way that ensures their essence will merge with the Quasielemental Plane itself, much in the way that an indigenous native's essence would upon their death.</p>

<p>Sulwynaari do exist on the Outer Planes, but they are far fewer in number.  Most Outer Planes Sulwynaari worship Arshan and Shanarr, the twin sun gods of Avadnu, though they also tend to revere Lathander, Pelor, and Belenus (and a minority even worship them).  </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">SULWYNAARI IN THE PLANESCAPE CAMPAIGN SETTING</span><br />
The blood of the Sulwynaari of mineral is not pure; the millenia spent on the Quasielemental plane has resulted in many dalliances with the natives of mineral, along with augmentation from Crystalle himself to make the race more resilient.  As a result, the Sulwynaari have acquired an immunity to petrification on earth-dominant planes (and ONLY in regards to this) and a +4 racial bonus on saves vs. mineral-based poisons (e.g. arsenic, mercury).  They also lost their low-light vision, which has been replaced by darkvision, and a Positive Resistance 5 in respect to accumulating temporary hit points.  (note: the attribute modifiers given in the Violet Dawn books are a bit loopy for 0 LA, so you should change the Cha bonus from +4 to +2.)<br />
The Sulwynaari who work the gemfields tend to be priests, wizards, artisians, or warriors with either positive protection spells or a ring of protection from positive energy, though others are planetouched.<br />
These sulwynarii do not automatic weapon proficiencies with swords or bows.<br />
Among the Sulwynaari, around 20% of the population consists of Kariwynaari, a planetouched race similar to genasi.  <br />
A small number of Sulwynaari exist on the Outer Planes-- primarily in Sigil, but also a few on Elysium, Arborea, and Celestia *with the highest number on Elysium*.  Sulwynaari in Sigil tend to associate with the elves or dwarves-- typically moon/gray elves and dwarves associated with the priesthood of Dumathoin.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">KARIWYNAARI RACIAL STATS</span><br />
---2 Dex, +2 Con, +4 Cha<br />
--Size: M<br />
--Base Land Speed: 30<br />
--Merge with Mineral (pass through stone, metal, or crystal 1x/day)<br />
--Mineral Resistance: +1 on saves vs. earth and mineral-based effects.<br />
--Favored Class: Fighter<br />
--+2 racial bonus on Diplomacy and Spot checks<br />
--Bonus Languages: Terran and Vivacian (together allow one to speak ---- *I have yet to decide on a name for the creole language spoken on Mineral*)<br />
--Mineral Resistance: +1 on saves vs. earth, metal, and crystal-based effects.  <br />
--Immune to environmental petrification effects on Earth-dominant planes <br />
--Positive Resistance 10<br />
--LA +1<br />
Appearance: Their skin has a metallic *generally bronzy* or glittery sheen.  The hair of males is nacrescent like mother-of-pearl, while the hair of females is a metallic fiery red.  Their eyes tend to be a deep sapphire blue, emerald green, or citrine yellow.  They tend to possess broader bodies than normal Sulwynaari, with large feet.<br />
10% of Kariwynaari are attuned to psionics instead of magic.  These individuals typically become psychic warriors *the favored class* combined with a few levels of psion or divine mind.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">HALF-MINERAL QUASIELEMENTAL SULWYNARII</span><br />
5% of Mineral's Sulwynaari population consists of half quasielementals.  Like their Kariwynaari bretheren, they tend to have broader bodies and large feet.  The irises of their eyes look like emeralds, sapphires, or citrines.  Their fingernails look like clear quartz, and their teeth look like diamonds.  Beyond that, they appear identical to the Ularwynaari, though their quasielemental colorations are more vibrant.<br />
--+2 Str, -2 Dex, +2 Con, +6 Cha<br />
--Immunity to petrification<br />
--Immunity to mineral-based poisons, such as arsenic and mercury<br />
--Immunity to Positive Energy (that is, they do not gain temporary hit points from positive energy effects)<br />
--Vulnerability to sonic<br />
+3 LA<br />
Sulwynaari and quasielemental society always has BIG expectations of half-mineral Sulwynaari due to their resistances and the fact that they represent half of both worlds.  Thus, Sulwynaari are usually expected to become high priests, high divine minds, hierophant druids, or wizards who tend the Gemfields for Crystalle, or to become fighters or rangers tasked with their guardianship.  This is because of the positive-dominant trait of the Gemfields, which makes it costly to hire anyone lacking at minumum, a positive resistance of 15.  Others are expected to become mediators-- embassadors if you will, to mediate any disputes between the Sulwynaari and the Quasielementals.  25% of half-Mineral Sulwynaari are attuned to psionics instead of magic.  These individuals typically become divine minds, psions, or psychic warriors.  Due to the inherent clumsiness of the race, lurks are nearly unheard of.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">CRYSTAL REFLECTORS ON MINERAL</span><br />
Crystal Reflectors, a wild animal protected by the Sulwynaari in the Forest of Waethe on their home world of Avadnu, were brought to Mineral long, long ago.  Unlike their prime cousins, the Mineral subspecies gains nourishment from positive energy emanations rather than sunlight.  These creatures instead can duplicate the following spell-like abilities using their <span style="font-style:italic">Harness Light</span> supernatural ability: Sunbeam, Sunburst, Daylight, Cure Serious Wounds, Lesser Restoration.  It gains the [Positive] subtype and is immune to petrification.  Its Challenge Rating increases by 1.  1 in 12 of this subspecies consists of half-quasielemental Crystal Reflectors.  These gain +2 to Str and Con, -2 to Dex, and +4 to Cha, vulnerability to sonic, along with the typical half-elemental immunities.  Their CR is increased by 2 instead of 1 like the typical mineral subspecies of Crystal Reflector.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>I managed to get into email contact with Jeff Visgaitis, the creative director of the Violet Dawn setting, asking him about the future of the setting.  He says that the company is on hiatus while he finishes art school, and after that he might release the 4E monsters and adventures that never saw the light of day.  For the most part however, he plans to work on Violet Dawn artbooks and a systemless campaign setting to allow Violet Dawn to be used with any rule system.  He assures that we haven't seen the last of the Violet Dawn setting.  So certainly, good news there.  He's also answered some questions I had about a few things, some of which have been included in edits to earlier posts.  I also got an answer on what Innilar (mentioned on the Obsidian Portal Sulwynaari page) is:</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic"> Innilar: This pale white metal has a bluish sheen and is found in swamps and other wet areas. Innilar was discovered long before the coming of the xxyth by a sulwynarii explorer of the same name. The use of innilar in weapons and armor has declined since the sulwynarii’s fall, and in modern days, few items are crafted from this wondrous metal. Innilar is extremely light, and is more likely to be worked into full plate and other heavy armors rare on Avadnu.<br />
Innilar is mechanically identical to mithral, except innilar never tarnishes or rusts, even when affected by a rust monster or rusting grasp spell.</span></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

          Encorporated timeline        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>I redid the timeline after realizing that some of the dates given were too short considering Sulwynaari lifespan.  The dates are from my timeline topic (aka "When was the Law/Chaos War), and use the Forgotten Realms system since that one dates back the furthest and is the most extensive.</p>

<p>--DR -4600: (approx) The 13 children of Temulea create a celestial object called the Daegir, which is used to imprison several noble/ascended Mistji.  Their essence is slowly siphoned and combined with the souls of elves to create the Sulwynaari race, a subrace of elvenkind.</p>

<p>--DR -3900: (approx) The Sulwynaari begin to explore the planes extensively.  A colony is established in the Quasielemental Plane of Mineral as cultists and servants of the Prince of Quasielemental Neutral Mineral, Crystalle.</p>

<p>--DR -3400 (approx): Temulea learns of his childrens' betrayal in the creation of the Sulwynaari, and goes into a rage across the Outlands, its effects reverberating across Violetspace.  Only Krug, the god of war, is foolish enough to challenge his father, and is slain.  His blood is scattered across Avadnu, which would eventually lead to the creation of the Skarren race.  <br />
Temulea's other children cast the Daegir to Avadnu in an attempt to distract Temulea while they escape to take temporary refuge in the divine realms of allies.  However, Morindalien, one of the twin moon gods, is unable to escape the Daegir's path in time, and is slain, his body sundered.  The children of Avadnu rush to acquire the fragments of the Daegir, which still contain much power.<br />
In the meantime, Temulea suffers a nervous breakdown and goes into an eternal slumber to escape from his pain.  His alignment also changes from CN to CE.</p>

<p>-- DR -3399 (approx): The War of the Daegir begins when a Zeidian warlord, known today only as "Kar’lil-arak" (roughly "the Lost") dares to gaze at the Daegir as it falls to Avadnu.  This warps him and causes him to be consumed by insatiable desire for the Daegir.  However, the Sulwynaari already beat him to it.  Frustrated and not deterred, Kar’lil-arak seeks forbidden power, and this married with his dark lusts transformed him into a threneghul when his physical body was destroyed in a fierce battle involving a combination of Sulwynaari, Mistji, Zeidian, and Khasep-Sa might.  The war drags on for many years.</p>

<p>-- DR -3390 (approx): The War of the Daegir is interrupted when strange creatures with maddening forms emerge from Avadnu's oceans and begin to destroy and corrupt everything they see.  Though slumbering and slowly dying on the Astral,  Temulea continues to exert his will on his children and the inhabitants of Violetspace. His nightmares created The Void, a slightly Far-Realm-esque demiplane full of Far-Realm-like Xxyth, a race created by Temulea to undo his creation entirely.  As the Xxyth and other voidspawn go to war with the Sulwynaari, the Time of Chaos begins.<br />
The dreaded threneghul warlord continues to seek the Daegir, but becomes preoccupied with the hordes of voidspawn just asking to be slaughtered.<br />
The Sulwynaari manage to rally all sentient races of Avadnu to their aid in annihilating the Voidspawn, all except for the Ngakoi, that is.</p>

<p>-- DR -3374 (approx): The Ngakoi, realizing that there can be neither escape from nor mediation with the Voidspawn, finally join forces with the Sulwynaari. Unfortunately, the Voidspawn just keep coming, and the children of Avadnu are in a losing position as their resources begin to exhaust.  At the same time, Ptah and Celestian decide that Violetspace must be sacrificed in order to save the rest of the multiverse and prevent the Voidspawn's spread-- the crystal sphere must be condemned and sealed away forever.  Irunean, now representing the Avadnian pantheon, pleads with them to reconsider.</p>

<p>-- DR -3368 (approx): The Sulwynaari finally use the largest shard of the Daegir, a major artifact known as the Ulwynaarl (or spirit-stone), against the Voidspawn.  The Sidereite make of the artifact bestows it with phenomenal taint-annihilating powers.  When it is used, all taint on Avadnu is instantaneously purified, and because taint is every bit of a Voidspawn's essence as evil is a Tanar'ri's essence, the artifact destroys all voidspawn on the planet.  However, the gates are still open, and more voidspawn flood out. <br />
Less than a month later, Irunean comes to an agreement and concession with Ptah and Celestian.  They will create a demiplane to separate Violetspace from the rest of the multiverse, and The Void from Violetspace.  In addition, they will place a seal on The Void in  order to close it.  By combining their powers, they succeed in their goal, and the flood of voidspawn armies finally ceases on Avadnu.  The races of Avadnu are able to wipe out nearly all the voidspawn remaining, though several manage to go into hiding.  However, the seal on The Void is barely strong enough to hold, and the Time of Chaos takes a heavy toll on the children of Avadnu-- esp. the Sulwynaari, whose race falls into significant decline, and their domination of Avadnu ending.  In addition, the prolongued wars bring a complete end to civilization for all races of Avadnu.</p>

<p>Note: Originally, the Avadnian pantheon sans Verthax and the Elemental Lords resided in Temulea's divine realm on the Outlands, towards the direction of Limbo.  It sustained heavy damage from Temulea's wrath, but was repaired by Irunean who rebuilt it to his own personal preferences.  The rest of the Avadnian pantheon went their separate ways and remained with the allies who graciously sheltered them from Temulea's wrath.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">
