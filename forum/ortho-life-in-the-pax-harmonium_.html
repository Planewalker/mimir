          Ortho: Life In The Pax Harmonium        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
        <div class="dice_rolls">
</div> <p><span style="font-style:italic">I've been trying to put my thoughts in order regarding daily life on Ortho, what its really like to *live* there. By necessity I've concentrated on what's average, official, and encouraged by the world state rather than trying to detail the Provincial life of widely scattered cultures. I've also steered clear of the Harmonium itself, government, and Churches for the moment.</p>

<p>All comments welcome.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic"><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>All OOC/DM comments in quotes</div></span></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic"><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-weight:bold">Life in the Pax Harmonium</span></span></span></p>

<p>Life on Ortho is civilised, structured, and interdependent – because that’s the way the Harmonium wants it. Despite the civil war it provoked, Composer Juhlien’s consolidation of powers left a lasting legacy on his world; a union of church, government, and military that made the Pax Harmony what it is today. Even those powers and resources retained by individual Provinces are now firmly part of society’s  infrastructure. Whether you believe Juhlien to be a reformer or a tyrant, his actions were the final stage in unifying the world. One man’s life is now bound to his community, his Province, and ultimately to all the worlds of the great harmony.  The Harmonium has worked for five centuries to build this world, and throughout their sphere of influence even the lowliest worker often thinks of himself as a vital cog in the mighty engine of the Pax Harmonium.</p>

<p>Ortho of course, is a big place. Provincial customs are permitted by the Pax Harmonium, much though the state encourages uniformity. Although the information below is the standard, accepted, and encouraged norm, there will obviously be local differences as well.</p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-weight:bold">Life in the Cities</span></span></p>

<p>Ortho is a thoroughly urbanised world, with civilisation based in and around her mighty cities. From labyrinthine government offices to soaring temples, to the crowded tenements of the lower classes and even the client farms beyond the walls, urban life dominates Ortho. </p>

<p>City planning is an important part of the state’s duties, with a whole department dedicated to design and improvement of each city’s infrastructure (not to mention its own Composer). With Harmony’s Glory and similar cities having over a million permanent residents to feed, water, clothe, and employ, architecture can be a life or death matter. </p>

<p>Each city is divided into Wards, districts that specialise in a particular industry or activity. Many Ward names are standardised, and a traveller can find Wards of Harmony, Duty, Consensus, and War in cities throughout Ortho, as well as more mundane monikers such as the Dock Ward, Caravan Ward, Factory Ward, and in certain heavily-industrialised eastern cities, the Smog Ward. In larger cities, each Ward often contains several smaller districts, sometimes known as ‘quarters’ because they are officially assigned a ‘slice’ of each Ward based on compass bearings. The exact number of composition of city quarters varies to the needs of the populace, but most cities have at least Parchment Quarter supplying writing materials to the city, a Market Quarter for visiting traders, and a Licensed Quarter for entertainments. There’s also a Dyer’s Quarter, but it is often isolated outside the city itself because of the awful smell and social stigma attached to it.</p>

<p>Wards are normally divided by thick fortified walls, which also double as barracks, store-houses, and bureaucratic checkpoints. Most Ward Gates are closed at the end of the Drunkard’s Hour and not re-opened until to Daily Provender arrives at the Clattering Hour. Its not unknown for sympathetic Harmonium to open the Ward Gate for late travellers, but most honest citizens should be in bed by then anyway.</p>

<p>Despite the relative peace of Ortho, all cities have defensive outer walls as well; the price of peace is eternal vigilance, as the Book of Harmony says. Despite this, most cities are expanding and there are carefully-planned constructions at various stages beyond the outer walls of most major settlements. Once planning for the new Ward is complete, a fresh set of defences and Ward Gates can be built to protect it. These new conurbations are often built around the latest technological innovations, and it’s not uncommon for a newly constructed district to experience a ‘land rush’ by wealthy citizens after new and prestigious dwellings.</p>

<p>City planning is ultimately the duty of the Composer of Civic Harmony, and all urban development is scrupulously planned. Between its dividing walls, architects design and supervise the construction of sewers, streets, houses, shops, plazas, and parks. Wide public roads criss-cross the city at right angles, dividing the buildings into ordered square blocks. Public spaces also dot the cityscape: water pumps, monuments, public notice boards, lavatories, and a hundred other things.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div><span style="font-style:italic">Unity has its benefits. Natives of the Pax Harmony gain a +4 bonus to Wis or Knowledge (local) checks - or whatever the DM uses as equivalent to Intuit Direction from 3.0 - made to navigate the great cities, because they are all designed around the same basic plan and philosophy. They can also use the Knowledge (local) skill just about ANYWHERE on Ortho or its colonies to get basic information on city design and what services are likely to be available nearby. </span></div></p>

<p>Only the cheapest houses face directly onto a main road, usually rows of tiny cheap tenements. These houses live next door to stables, carpenters, and other local artisans who serve each district, but the majority of dwellings in each block face inwards towards a communal area called an Allotment – or simply as an Allot. Most allotments have their own water well, public conveniences, and middens as well as a meeting space, but their primary purpose is social. Neighbours are supposed to meet regularly, get know one another, and be involved in their communities. Those who refuse to participate may be reported as isolationists and xenophobes by their neighbours or the allotment’s official representative. </p>

<p>Allotments are used in some form throughout the settlements of Ortho, adapted as needed to terrain and local culture. Allots serve between a dozen and a hundred homes, depending on their size, and in governmental records they are the smallest official division of a city beyond individual homes. Some Provinces deliberately mix different races in their allots, while others prefer them to be enclaves of a specific race, profession, of faith. Only if their choice creates trouble does it become a matter of Public Law and the responsibility of the government. Almost all block representatives are Harmonium members anyway, who know how to keep the peace.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic"><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Allot parties are notorious for gossip, and those seeking to gather information on local characters and events will find them the perfect tools for the job: Gather Information checks made at an allot party usually get a +2 bonus.</div></span></p>

<p>The open space of the allotment is used for residents’ meetings as well as festivals and rituals attended by all the families who share it. It’s not uncommon for citizens on a new business venture to host a party and ceremony to the Lords of Order (especially Iathiphos), for a blessing, a show of respectability, and some free advertising. It’s no coincidence that a successful party often coincides with a successful venture. </p>

<p>The amount of decoration (frescos, engravings, statuary, etc) varies relative to the block’s prosperity, but most citizens try and do something as a matter of pride. There are a surprising number of regulations about what can and can’t be done to decorate an allot - it is illegal to magically light them without written permission, for example – but such matters are the responsibility of the allot’s spokesman, an elected representative who speaks for the allot in the district and Ward and councils.<br />
	<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Housing</span></p>

<p>Broadly speaking, if they dwell in a town or city the majority of Orthunian citizens live in one of three types of housing: manses, barracks, or tenements.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Manses </span>are private homes owned by relatively wealthy citizens. They vary from the tiny homes of mid-ranked soldiers and bureaucrats packed in one beside another, to the opulent compounds owned by rich merchants and the stately palaces of Ortho’s ruling elite. Manses are also the chief residence to be found in rural areas, owned by much more humble faming families or even solitary hermits. Size, style, and just about every other factor varies between Provinces.</p>

<p>The rich enjoys enjoy having gardens around their manses, a luxury enjoyed only by the very wealthy in cities where space is a premium. Larger manses may also include secondary buildings around their perimeter, such as stabling and servants quarters. The main house itself will face into a secluded central area however, used in much the same way as an allotment but only by the family and its guests.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Tenements </span>are the standard housing of Ortho’s working class. They follow the same basic pattern as blocks of manses, but rather than individual houses a tenement consists of by many individual apartments, often just a single room divided internally by screens or curtains. Unlike most manses each apartment is rented rather than owned, and the landlord may be a private citizen or the state itself. Communal kitchens and other necessities occupy the ground floor of tenements, with residences on the upper levels. The highest tenements are usually six stories tall, with the upper floors being the most prestigious. Many have improvised gardens on their rooftops, where the inhabitants produce fruit and vegetables. More than a few roof-gardens have been used to produce illegal substances or homemade alcohol. This well known to the Harmonium, but the level of tolerance varies greatly from place to place. </p>

<p>Tenement life varies hugely in quality, from respectable blocks of honest workers to the warrens of criminal gangs where the wise do not linger after dark. People come and go from a given tenement depending on their wealth, but there is usually a waiting list for the better blocks. Harmonium officers often get preferential treatment in the application process, as their influence helps keep things safe and secure - tenements with a reputation for trouble might well wake one morning to find a squad of soldiers billeted in their block. Of course, each allotment (manse, tenement, or barracks) should have a representative of the Harmonium anyway, to help bind the community together.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Barracks </span>are very similar to tenements, save that they are dedicated to a specific group –soldiers, apprentices, pupils at an academy, and very low level bureaucrats are all regularly billeted together. Factory workers can also end up in these buildings, which in crowded Wards are often adjoin their place of work and are owned by the same merchant or cartel. Workers eat, sleep, celebrate, and work all in the same block; some social reformers have claimed that this situation is tantamount to slavery. Barracks are also common in rural areas, home to legions of unskilled farmhands toiling in the fields, and ’workhouses’ for criminals paying off their debt to society on a chain gang or prison farm.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Outside the Allots</span></p>

<p>The outer edge of every block usually hosts various businesses used by its inhabitants, but each city also has whole blocks dedicated purely to commerce. Commercial districts usually specialise in a single service area, such as equipping the army, providing food, or supplying household goods. In theory each set of allots is near to its own commercial district as well, providing everyday services for the locals. Many Market Quarters also host ‘merchant allots’ where venture companies and cartels have offices in fierce competition. Larger cartels have offices in the merchant allots for minor business but prefer to run things from their own compounds instead, often located outside the city. Excessive overt displays of wealth are frowned upon in most Provinces, so rich merchants typically maintain an outward façade of respectability, the opulent luxury kept within the walls.</p>

<p>Despite the wealth of the trade districts it is official state buildings that dominate the skyline. The towering architecture of temples, government offices, and harmonium campuses are as majestic as their loftiest ideals. All are built along the same cathedral-like style, further unifying the triad of powers in the minds of all who see them. Behind the impressive frontages are blocks of tenements, barracks, and supplier allots providing for their needs, including the virtual forest of paper that’s used by the administration each year.  </p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Parks &amp; Plazas</span></p>

<p>Between the residential, commercial, and government districts are communal squares and parks, preserved by the state for the people of Ortho. They are also used for festivals and celebrations, most often religious ceremonies and Harmonium parades. A particularly large open marketplace in each ward is known simply as The Plaza. Often very close to prestigious merchant allots, this Plaza is used for markets, meetings, respectable entertainments, and as a poling station whenever voting is required from the populace. They are busy places and the centre of life in each Ward. In smaller settlements and villages, the Plaza is usually the village allot.</p>

<p>The Plaza is the place to information and gossip from across the Ward. Criers deliver news and missives from platforms: New edicts in force, updates of current building projects and renovations, which private citizens have contributed to the Daily Provender etc, as well as proclaiming each hour of the day. Plazas are also the centre of unofficial news, spread by committed gossips who rarely miss a day. </p>

<p>A visit to the Plaza generally adds +2 to a Gather Information check made about someone in the Ward. Official statements and the like can be heard here daily however, and don’t need a roll. Most travellers head for their nearest plaza when new in town, to find out who’s who and what’s going on.</p>

<p>Orators also come here to make a name for themselves, to mould public opinion, and to elicit support for any particular issue of interest to him - or more commonly to their patrons. Most orators are paid to put across someone else’s views.<br />
 <br />
<span style="font-style:italic">Ward Parks</span></p>

<p>The Plaza may be home to business, busybodies, and bustle, but tired citizens can usually escape for a few minutes of serene contemplation in the War Park. All cities try to maintain at least one or two small parks within their bounds, and some even dedicate an entire Quarter or Ward to providing a relaxing urban garden for the populace.</p>

<p>Obviously what best constitutes a park is left to the discretion of each city council, but most contain a central pool or fountain, flower beds (and perhaps a copse of trees), a grassy are and gravel paths wending between them all. Larger Ward Parks are a popular site for walks, picnics, and respectable assignations, and another site of regular festivals as well. Even the poorest districts try to maintain some patch of land, even if the flora must be practical contributions to the Provender rather than flowers.</p>

<p>Ward Parks are guarded and maintained by ageing Harmonium officers, who keep the paths raked, the flowerbeds scrupulously free of weeds, light the lamps on an evening, and lock the gates each night. Although more caretakers than police, they are still responsible for public order and move along those who try and disrupt the peace and quiet. More than one rebellious youth has been surprised to discover the ‘old man’ he stands up to is actually the fearsome veteran of a thousand campaigns.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Ward Elections</span></p>

<p>As a general rule, Ortho is no a great fan of democracy. In the opinion of multiple Composers, democracy too often becomes a popularity contest or is corrupted by bribery and patronage. The government prefers a strong central authority and officials who have earned their place through meritorious conduct. They do however encourage participation in local decisions through committees and representatives, as it creates a sense of community responsibility. Electing representatives, lobbying for new public services, prioritising festivals and celebrations, raising specific matters with the city council, and the like are all within the remit of the Ward council, but their decisions are always subject to veto by higher powers.</p>

<p>Someone the PCs know to be a villain – greedy cartel princes or corrupt guard captains work best here - stands for election to the Ward Council. There’s nothing to be done legally about him, so if they don’t want their enemy to gain even more power, they’ll have to find (fabricate?) some dirt on him to ruin his chances – or maybe one of them could stand against him?</p>

<p>Each allot has a representative who speaks for them in the local Ward or Quarter committee, advising three elected officials who in turn represent the Ward’s inhabitants in higher councils. Term of service is for only one year, but it’s not uncommon for officials to serve for multiple terms. Representatives of allots, Quarters, and Wards are all elected, although the numbers and exact duties can vary widely based on local law and custom. It’s almost unheard of for candidates for Quarter or Ward to be non-Harmonium members, as legal financial support for such people is minimal (the Harmonium meanwhile, always funds the campaigns of members), and voters regard with deep suspicion anyone without at least some kind of Harmonium service record.</p>

<p>Voting on Ortho follows the Osmondian tradition: Great glass vases record the votes, which are made by selecting a small coloured stone (usually black or white for simple yes/no questions, with additional colours for more complex issues), which are dropped into the appropriate container and publicly counted. Voting is public and strictly one vote to one person, and only possible with the presentation of the voter’s citizenship papers, which are stamped to prevent repeat voting. Harmonium personnel watch over even the most minor vote to ensure complete propriety.</p>

<p>Before and during voting, speakers occupy the plaza trying to convince the populace to their cause. Each stands before a coloured cloth and wears an armband of the same material, its colour matching that of their voting stone. There are no “political parties” as such - the Way of Harmony is the only acceptable philosophy. Within the Harmonium there are numerous factions and individuals supporting different causes and viewpoints, however. It’s not uncommon to see people wearing their ‘voting colours’ for days before an important vote as a show of support. Ward politics is often used by the powers that be to judge grassroots support for their strategies – whether or not they decide to heed it.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">The Daily Provender</span></p>

<p>The massive urban population requires an endless supply of food and goods, a massive logistical task requiring military-style organisation. An endless supply of carts, wagons, and pack animals clatter in and out of Ortho’s cities, most of which have a dedicated ‘supply gate’ to ease the pressure. The noise is so cacophonous that laws have been put in place to restrict their travel in deep night. Citizens may sleep a little easier as a result, but when traffic resumes the congestion is even worse.</p>

<p>The state considers the acquisition, transport, and distribution of food and other basic necessities to be of prime importance to the stability and happiness of its citizens. This toil of daily deliveries is called the Provender Run (also the slang term for any hard work, low-profit trip among merchants and Free Folk). Each Daily Provender is based around subsidised markets who sell food and basic goods at very low places, but it always includes free bread stamped with the Harmonium seal as well, which is distributed to the poor. Merchant cartels and individuals looking to court public opinion often pay for a portion of the Provender themselves, gaining the right to add their own heraldic stamp to the bread too. In some provinces, this tactic is considered essential to the political landscape, and a good way to demonstrate your loyalty to the Pax Harmonium as well. </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div><span style="font-style:italic">The Daily Provender is a ‘Poor Meal’, as described in the Player’s Handbook. It usually costs just 5cp to buy, although the free bread available also counts as a poor meal. Between them, they are enough – barely – to prevent a character from starving.</span></div></p>

<p>Local Farms supply the vegetables and fruits for the Provender markets, but fish and meat are not included unless plentiful locally. These state subsidised markets are among the most visible and popular daily gain for citizens under Harmonium rule, although some snobbery exists against using them among the richer classes. Not everyone claims free bread of course, but the average family visits the Provender Market for its daily provisions and has more disposal income as a result. By keeping food prices deliberately low, the Pax Harmonium has made everyone a little bit richer… except for the farmers who produce and sell it. State subsidies are supposed to compensate rural communities for the low prices they are forced to sell at, but the coin rarely balances out in their favour. Farmers are always looking for ways to improve their lot, but only the very lucky or wealthy can afford magic or the use of the latest technology such as the steamhorse or mechanical scarecrow. Many farms use indentured criminals as labour.</p>

<p>Due to the sheer amount of daily traffic into each city, only the Knights Roads can cope with the constant traffic. Large caravansaries surround the roads just beyond the city, bottlenecks where supply caravans must wait until cleared for entry. Those carrying the Provender always receive priority however, although rich caravans can pay a special tariff (‘bribe’ would be a better word the poorer merchants claim) to have their goods expedited. </p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">‘Provs’</span></p>

<p>Those who must rely upon the free daily bread of the Provender are somewhat stigmatised in Orthunian society. There is a common perception that everyone could have gainful employment if they wished it – in the Harmonium if nowhere else – and although everyone has an empty purse now and then, constantly relying on state charity is something done only by rogues and ne’er do wells. Obviously this is not the case, but ‘Prov’ has become a derogatory term in the Pax Harmony, equating poverty to moral and physical laxity. Provs also have an unfounded reputation for being disagreeable and failing to appreciate the great harmony they are part of, and are blamed for most unrest or resistance in the slums. In truth, many “prov troublemakers” are just poor folk trying to improve their lot and those of their fellows on the bottom rungs of society.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">The Licensed Quarter</span></p>

<p>For years certain groups on Ortho have campaigned to outlaw all drink, drugs, and bawdiness from the land. The simple reality however is that such things do go on, and the predominant opinion in the councils of Ortho is that if it is going to go on, it might as well be legal, regulated, and taxed. </p>

<p>Although a citizen can certainly purchase alcohol and other legal intoxicants outside the Licensed Quarter, taverns are rare. Public drunkenness is illegal and vendors can be held responsible for the actions of drunken customers. A few wine shops and breweries have ‘tasting areas’ (taverns in all but name), but for the most part if a citizen wants to enjoy a few tankards of ale, they need to take them home or head for the Licensed Quarter.</p>

<p>These areas are known for their wildness and disreputability but a visitor from other worlds would probably laugh at that reputation; each city’s Licensed Quarter is firmly controlled by the state and really rather… respectable.</p>

<p>Punitive taxes penalise any business that provides a service the state disapproves of, but these are lessened significantly in the Licensed Quarter. Only the state owns land in there - all businesses must rent. They also require an operating licence, which must be renewed each year. Places that cause more trouble than they’re worth are simply closed down and rented to a new proprietor. </p>

<p>The Licensed Quarter officially opens at noon, but it’s rarely busy until night has fallen. All businesses close strictly at midnight, and patrons have an hour to get out, after which the gates are locked until the following noon. This last hour is commonly known as The Drunkard’s Hour and Harmonium patrols typically round up anyone on the streets after it on charges of vagrancy. Some establishments offer rooms (usually at exorbitant prices) to get around the licensing laws, allowing their clients to keep drinking long after the doors are shut. Although illegal, this practise is usually ignored by the guards as long as everyone behaves themselves.</p>

<p>The Licensed Quarter only has two gates, one for entrance and one for exit. Both are guarded by Harmonium soldiers who monitor everyone’s comings and goings. Soldiers are also stationed within the district, providing directions and assistance to visitors. Most trouble consists only of escorting the inebriated to holding cells (its an offence to leave while intoxicated), subduing the occasional violent drunk (often brawling soldiers), or separating a fight between prostitutes. “The Drunk Patrol” is widely regarded as an easy posting with many opportunities for corruption.</p>

<p>Around the outside of each gate are Changing Houses, private baths where visitors may refresh themselves and change clothes both before and after their visit. Most of these establishments sell ‘disguises’ - hooded robes and veil-hung, wide brimmed hats worn by clients who’d rather not be identified. The disguises of most changing houses show their heraldry as well, identifying its clients to staff if they should require assistance. Most establishments provide other services as well, such as guides, introduction services, bodyguards, and private carriages and sedans. A few may even have discrete entrances and exits to the Quarter – although these are highly illegal and grounds for immediate closure.</p>

<p>Getting into and out of the district is easy – if you’re happy to give your name and citizen papers to the guards. Officially the district is not part of a respectable city, and a visit to the Licensed Quarter requires that a citizen produce his papers. These are kept for the duration of their stay, but visitors are given a receipt – a small wooden token usually hung about the neck - to redeem their papers with when they leave. Harmonium often take the receipt numbers of visitors after incidents, allowing them to trace who was where and when.</p>

<p>Immediately inside the gate a plethora of taverns, saunas, massage parlours, bawdy houses, brothels, and burlesque shows cluster, fighting for the attention of newcomers. Painted bright and gaudy, these generally cater for less wealthy and stylish clientele. Elegant courtesans and more upscale entertainments are found at the district’s heart, which in more prosperous quarters may well have a small park for assignations.  </p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic"><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div><span style="font-weight:bold">Adventure Hooks</span></p>

<p>A pair of star-crossed lovers from bitterly rival merchant cartels can meet only in the Licensed Quarter. The PCs are hired to arrange the venue (communicating with both lovers, who are virtually prisoners in their own houses) and escorting them  to and from it – including breaking them out (and back in!) to their manses, and dealing with the cartel’s own enforcers who are determined to stop the rendezvous from taking place.</p>

<p>A PC wakes up after a visit to the Licensed Quarter and discovers that he still has his receipt. Somehow he managed to get out without redeeming the token for his travel papers. The papers are presumably still with the Harmonium at the gate. Turning up to reclaim them from the outside will simply get him arrested for exiting illegally the night before (a serious offence). The PC will have to sneak back in somehow before the guards suspect trouble and start searching for him. Particularly responsible (or disreputable) citizens might also want to retrace their steps from the night before, trying to find out how they got out in the first place…</p>

<p>The PCs are lingering at a tavern that pretends to provide ‘rooms’ for the night so as to escape the License Laws. As the Drunkard’s Bell sounds (indicating the closure of the gate until noon tomorrow), they are approached by a nervous Harmonium clerk. He claims to have a vitally important meeting at dawn tomorrow, which he just can’t miss. He offers them gold or future favours if they can smuggle him out of the district.</p>

<p>Returning from a pleasant night in the district, a PC mistakenly heads home with someone else’s travel papers instead of her own. Fortunately all papers include their owner’s name and address, but there may be other complications (the individual could be a crook, have left the city, be very important and not want it known where he was, etc – they might even be wanted by the law!) The PC could just turn himself in, but the process will likely be very long, very boring, tangled with bureaucracy, and might end up on their personal record. Surely it would be easier to just go and swap them back? </div></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-weight:bold">Life in the Countryside</span></span></p>

<p>Farms and factories cover every inch of viable land around each metropolis for many days travel. They produce grain, fruits and vegetables, wine, ale, cloth, and the thousand other things needed for the Daily Provender. Country life is interwoven with the great cities for leagues beyond their walls.</p>

<p>Rural life follows the same basic pattern as its urban counterpart, but often poorer and more widely spaced. Farmhouses replace city manses, hamlets the tenement blocks. Many client farms also house their staff in barracks – especially seasonal workers hired for the harvest or indentured criminals labouring to pay off their debts.</p>

<p>Rural life often flirts with outright poverty, for the state deliberately sets a low price for the Provender crops that make up most farms’ output. Most independent farmers struggle, but the larger farming cartels make a good living from mass crops and cheap labour. Few independent farms can afford the expense of raising ‘luxury’ crops rather than those for the Provender. The state tries to help with subsidies, tax-relief, and state sponsored innovations for Provender farmers, but all it takes are a few bad years or unexpected costs and another ranch gets bought out by the state or a farming cartel.</p>

<p>Harmonium membership is lower in rural areas than in the cities, because the people profit less by it. Signing up with the soldiery, a church, or the government is seen mainly as an escape. Each hamlet, barracks or farm still has an elected speaker however, ensuring that everything runs smoothly, legally, and morally. Villages are arranged into blocks and allots just like in the cities, but without the surrounding walls. Raiders aren’t a problem in the majority of the Pax Harmonium. For most farmers a visit to the Licensed Quarter is a practical impossibility, so entertainment and other services are taken care of by travelling shows.</p>

<p>Between the farms are factories, which seem to squat on every stream that flows fast enough to turn a waterwheel and every hill that can catch a breeze in windmill sails. A traveller will also pass checkpoints, shrines, Harmonium camps, and semaphore towers on their way down the road.</p>

<p>Cartel Compounds are another common sight. Both home and business for the Cartel Lords, these compounds (often opulent and palatial compared to their neighbours) provide a retreat from the cramp and bustle of city life. They are also a status symbol; with productive space at such a premium outside the city walls, only the richest citizens can afford to ‘waste’ good growing land on housing.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Workhouses &amp; Prison Farms</span></p>

<p>As the population expanded, the Harmonium looked for ways put its criminal element to work feeding and clothing more responsible citizens. Workhouses and prison farms were the solution; removing the criminals, recanters, and antiopodes from the cities where they could do most harm and putting to work on the Daily Provender where their labour could do most good.</p>

<p>Some of these establishments are run by the state, others merely overseen by the Harmonium while a rich farmer or merchant cartel handles day to day affairs. Separated and guarded from honest citizens, these prisons offer redemption through hard labour; usually either work raising crops for the Provender or doing the hard repetitive jobs that keep society running: Dyeing, needle-making, butchery, sewing uniforms for soldiers, and other work. Some are genuine efforts to redeem as well as punish their inmates; others are terrible houses of pain and suffering where few criminals see the light of day again.</p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-weight:bold">The Knights’ Roads</span></span></p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div><span style="font-style:italic">This needs integrating with what we already have on them</span></div></p>

<p>Knights’ Roads cut arrow straight through the landscape, but the image of the lonely road stretching off through the wilderness is largely inaccurate. Stone supply bunkers line the road for use by soldiery, semaphore Stations shadow the road, and it’s a rare journey that doesn’t get stopped at a checkpoint or three. There are also campsites for marching legions, hostels for civilian travellers, tent-towns of Free Folk showmen taking a break from the farm circuit, and even the occasional aerostat station, servicing both civilian and military airships. </p>

<p>Where two roads meet, a Harmonium Road Garrison is sure to be found. Categories by tall watchtowers looking out over the lands, these bases are manned by cavalry units (usually land-bound, sometimes aerial) and co0mpanies of military engineers who patrol and maintain the roads. It is hardly an onerous duty, and most of the soldiers are being rested from more hazardous duties – although it’s also a common posting for ‘short-cloaks’ as well. On the whole these garrisons change personnel quite regularly; permanent assignment to a Road Garrison is usually seen as a ‘retirement post’ or a punishment or a way to quietly sideline a corrupt or incompetent commander the Harmonium can’t otherwise be rid of.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Semaphore Stations</span></p>

<p>Semaphore stations flank most Knights’ Roads, providing swift communication between cities and roadside checkpoints. Once upon a time criminals could simply flee an area they were wanted in and become virtually untraceable, but things are very different now. Not long after they were introduced across Ortho, murderous fraudster Betan Hooke fell foul of the new technology; he fled the town of Hog’s Head for port Lorvita, but the semaphore message overtook his speeding carriage and he found the Harmonium waiting for him when he arrived. Semaphore operators are still nicknamed “Betanbaiters” in his honour.</p>

<p>Semaphore is a relatively recent invention, although the system itself has been used for generations on the water. Under the Second Harmony the naval system of ship-to-ship signalling was expanded and standardised, and adapted for use over land. </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div><span style="font-style:italic">Semaphore Code is potential language choice for Harmonium characters. Obviously it has no spoken form, but the language covers not just tower signs but ship flags, spell-signals, and heliographs as well.</span></div></p>

<p>Semaphore is faster than a mounted messenger, although a few skilled horsemen from traditional nomad clans can challenge this if they have changes of horse ready and waiting for them along the road.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic"><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div><span style="font-weight:bold">Adventure Hook</span><br />
As a short adventure or solo quest, a skilled PC rider (paladin, or a ranger or druid with a mount companion) might get involved in a wager about the speed of the semaphore. Can they beat the message in a wild ride down the Knights’ Road? Such a challenge would have numerous opportunities for skulduggery, and disreputable parties might get involved from that angle as well.</div></span></p>

<p>The semaphore machine is composed of movable wooden arms, the combined position of which defines a certain symbol, which in turn corresponds to a letter or phrase. A total of one hundred and ninety-six combinations make up the semaphore code, which suffices for almost all messages. Magical lights placed on the arms allow the system can operate at night, although this is done only for official messages. Possession of a semaphore codebook by those not directly involved in their use is a crime.</p>

<p>Mechanical hand cranks operate the rotating semaphore arms, usually worked by a team of four men. Although a single operator could work the system by him or herself, but only very slowly. Many Harmonium armies carry several portable versions of this system (including spars to create a tower) in the baggage train of their military engineers, allowing messages to be signalled swiftly to and from the front when magical means are not readily available.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Checkpoints</span></p>

<p>Crossroads are a common location for checkpoints: Gates across the road where traffic is stopped and examined by Harmonium troops. Guards examine the citizen papers of travellers – both individuals and merchant caravans – for sign of illegal or immoral goings on. Those apprehended are usually incarcerated at the checkpoint gaol for an extended period while the matter is processed. These investigations are rarely a priority however, and those incarcerated can expect a long stay.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div><span style="font-style:italic"><span style="font-weight:bold">ADVENTURE HOOK</span>
The PCs are imprisoned at a checkpoint gaol, for suspected crimes real or imagined. The officer in charge offers them a choice: be imprisoned for who knows how long, or do a ‘little favour’ for him.</span></div></p>

<p>In stable times these checks don’t take too long. But when news arrives of a criminal on the run or other trouble they rapidly become choked with waiting men and horses. Nor are travellers processed in order of arrival – there is a hierarchy of ‘road privilege’ that forces all civilians to wait while official representatives move on, and among citizens certain travellers or goods are also given priority. Arguments are frequent between travellers that feel they are being unfairly held up.</p>

<p>It’s not unheard of for caravans to be delayed for an entire day, and many travellers prefer to camp at a checkpoint anyway. Hamlets or semi-permanent camps often spring up around cross-roads to serve their needs, and many peddlers and minor merchants hang around checkpoints selling their wares, from simple cups of tea and bite to eat, to the comforts of nearby inns and fresh horses.<br />
 </p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-weight:bold">Daily Life on Ortho</span></span></p>

<p>In the city daily life begins at the <span style="font-style:italic">Clattering Hour</span> (five hours after midnight), when the Provender wagons begin to roll. Those who can sleep through the racket usually rise just before dawn however.</p>

<p>Most families have a household shrine, so the day normally begins with a prayer to the Gods of Order. For some this is a simple touch and moment of contemplation, although for many more it is a full service. The sound of church bells, hymns, and chanted prayers echo out in the dawn light - alongside the chimes of public clocktowers in cities – to signal the start of the <span style="font-style:italic">Prayer Hour</span>. This is only the official start of the day however; many hardworking Provs began their labours much earlier and merely take this time as a break for prayer and breakfast. </p>

<p>Markets and shops open at the end of the Prayer Hour (one hour after dawn), in what’s officially known as the <span style="font-style:italic">Market Hour</span>. Educational establishments also begin their lessons at this time, although students have typically been present for religious and moral instruction since dawn. </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div><span style="font-style:italic">The state prides itself on encouraging literacy across the population and most citizens are well educated, at least to a basic level. On Ortho all members of NPC classes are also literate.</span> </div></p>

<p>Those with the leisure to do so often take some exercise and/or a bath in the mornings, at either their own homes (if they’re wealthy), or a public gymnasium, Harmonium campus, or commercial bathhouse. Cleanliness is a civilised virtue in the Pax Harmonium and is encouraged in all its citizens. Its not uncommon for some people to bathe twice a day. Males and females bathe strictly separately at public establishments, to avoid any activities best left at home or in the licensed quarter.</p>

<p>Public baths are often very busy at the Market Hour, with long lines for admittance by the time that Prayer Hour ends. Many citizens chose to queue during the Prayer Hour instead, but to maintain public respectability they employ the services of acolyte priests, who perform quick services up and down the lines in exchange for a donation to their faith. </p>

<p>After refreshing themselves, most citizens head for the Plaza or their place of business to begin the working day. Most people take their lunch at noon, during the <span style="font-style:italic">Duty Hour</span> – named because this marks one of the three changes in rota for Harmonium troops across the city. There are two other changes as well, one eight hours before noon and the other eight hours after.</p>

<p>For an average city dweller, the working day ends at the <span style="font-style:italic">Shadow Hour</span>, an hour before dusk. Most people head home about this time, although the bathhouses also enjoy their second rush of the day at this time. Thanks to the Pax Harmonium’s economic strength and technical innovations, most people work a significantly shorter day than the inhabitants of other worlds, but they are expected to continue applying themselves to the cause of Harmony once their working day is done. Many citizens have a second job at night up-keeping their tenement or allot.</p>

<p>Shadow Hour also marks the beginning of the “night shift” when nocturnal races and those who work at night - such as lamp lighters and waste collectors - may emerge to begin their day. Many night workers are actually partners with their daytime companions, and merely take over their job or business in the hours of darkness. ‘Night Street’ is a common name for commercial blocks across Ortho that stay open throughout the hours of darkness. </p>

<p>Nights are a time for family and community. Most families sit down together for an evening meal, either in their houses or the communal kitchen/dining area of their tenement. Evening meals are traditionally a time to speak of the day’s events and the citizen’s deeds for Harmony, followed by some form of entertainment. Many people meet with other families sharing their allot after dinner, with storytelling, drinking, or other specially laid on entertainments (sometimes paid for, sometimes performed by residents). Neighbouring allots sometime put on shows for neighbouring blocks as well, adding some variety to the same old faces every night. Modest drinking is permitted at social gatherings, but most people take their evening ale or wine watered down so as to avoid charges of public drunkenness.</p>

<p>Unless working on a ‘Night Street’, an unofficial general curfew exists after midnight. Laws prevent certain activities (transporting goods for example, and activities in the Licensed Quarter) but unless you have business to be out, the Harmonium expects good citizens to be tucked up in bed by the end of the Drunkard’s Hour.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div><span style="font-style:italic">Various Names for the Hours of the Day – note that some of these Named Hours may occur at different times of the day when the season’s change.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Art &amp; Literature</span></p>

<p>Keen to be seen as more than just a band of warriors, a small but dedicated cadre of the Knights of Harmony were champions of the arts. Bards by training, they also served as diplomats, agitators, and spies. The traditions they started have continued down the centuries, side by side with the harmonium’s martial work. For many of a peaceful demeanour, the arts are way to show loyalty to the cause and gain fame and wealth from it.</p>

<p>In the Pax Harmonium, art is a celebration of Harmony’s great achievements. Busts, sculptures, paintings and frescos of Harmonium personalities, victories, and historical events dominate the profession. Many citizens have pictures of those they wish to emulate (the original Knights and Romhel in particular being eternally popular), or of great battles, treaties, or other events they’d like to commemorate. Styles vary between the Provinces, but a strong thread of dramatic realism pervades the art of even the most far-flung colony.</p>

<p>Legitimate literature is dominated by the Book of Harmony, which is available from just about every vendor on the planet. It’s a rare household that doesn’t have a well-thumbed copy in its possession – and in more repressive regimes the lack of one alone has been considered grounds for an investigation. Most households use the abridged ‘soldier’s copy’ but wealthier citizens often own several full volume sets, lovingly illustrated and bound in fine red leather and gold leaf.</p>

<p>Most Harmonium work is extensively documented in diaries and reports, and many famous personalities have become rich producing their memoirs at the end of a long career (examined and edited for inappropriate material, of course). The works of the Knights themselves are still popular: Romhel penned <span style="font-style:italic">The Journey </span>as an account of his beliefs, Jhary of Heka wrote <span style="font-style:italic">Ethics of the Ant </span>long before joining the Knights, and in later years Anju became famous for her <span style="font-style:italic">Scrolls of Inner Harmony</span>. <span style="font-style:italic">Romhel’s Campaigns </span>(assembled from a variety of sources close to the original Knights) is another perennial favourite that details the quest of the Knights and the birth of the Harmonium. Gazetteers of colonies and the outer planes are also published regularly, and accounts of the horrors of the Iron War have proved popular of late. </p>

<p>Aside from such notables, Ortho produces the same gamut of poetry, comedy, history, and tragedy as other worlds. Among popular non-Harmonium related materials, the Rhapsodies of Motmurk (epic poems about the deeds of ancient gods and heroes) usually make an exciting tale, as do the Chaos Tragedies: A body of work that focuses on Iathran and Thaeran history and myth. Although loaded with pro-Harmonium sentiment, the chaos tragedies contain plenty of action, melodrama, and characters ‘everyone loves to hate’ –who always come to a bad end while the hero gets the girl.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Theatre &amp; Other Entertainments</span></p>

<p>By dictate of the Council of Composers, all theatrical performances and other works of public entertainment must “have value to the education, moral, or general betterment of the people of Ortho.” Over the years this definition has been stretched to cover just about anything, but all productions must still be submitted to the Office of the Minister of Revels for approval before they can be exposed to the public. The Ministry has the power to close down venues and issue warrants against players who violate the law.</p>

<p>On the whole, the system works. Players who refuse to follow the rules are marginalised, their establishments closed and their papers’ marked. Back alley theatres and underground players still exist in the cities however (or touring the wilderness), performing forbidden plays and satires against establishment figures. They appear for a night or two of inflammatory performances, then vanish like smoke. </p>

<p>Authorised theatre usually depicts historical events – either triumphs of the Harmonium or the follies of chaos. Mythological tales from before the Knights of Harmony are also performed, but always with a slant towards Harmonium philosophy (either deliberately or added just to fulfil the requirements of the Revel Law).</p>

<p>Performances have been standardised over the years, to better integrate different styles and local differences. Rather than individual outfits and characters, actors often wear a simple uniform to indicate their status – a king, a priest, a follow of chaos, etc – and play a generic role. Some of these characters don’t even have names, like The Wise Priest, The Usurper, and the Honest Soldier. Others have names drawn from Ortho’s well-known history and myth. Most characters even in new plays are therefore easily recognisable.</p>

<p>Many travelling players are members of the Free folk, touring the cities and the lands between in a nomadic lifestyle. They are more welcome on the road than in the great cities however, which often have their own established companies of actors who dislike the competition.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div><span style="font-style:italic"><span style="font-weight:bold">ADVENTURE HOOK</span>
The party is tracking down a murderer of unusual cunning and charm; a master of disguise who tricks and extorts money from the wealthy, then ensures their silence with blackmail or the knife. The PCs eventually trace him to a troupe of travelling actors and discover their secret – the troupe is home to a band of doppelgangers. The real culprit however is an unscrupulous wizard who’s using illegal charm and domination spells to force the clan to do his will. The doppelgangers claim to only want to live in peace and anonymity, and beg the PCs not to reveal their secret to the authorities.</span></div></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Architecture</span></p>

<p>Harmonium cities are well planned, efficiently managed, and neatly maintained – there’s no other way to accommodate so many people. Town planning is comprehensive both for residents and the countless migratory population of soldiers, travellers, traders, even tourists. Civil engineering is an advanced and prestigious science on Ortho.</p>

<p>Local architectural traditions are tolerated, but the state prefers a standard approach to their buildings’ design and layout. It’s their firm operational principle that a soldier suddenly teleported into the farthest-flung Harmonium outpost could take one look around and know exactly where the mess hall, barracks, drill fields, and officers’ quarters are. The same should apply to civilian settlements as well.</p>

<p>By law all official buildings are faced with red brick or painted in Harmonium colours to clearly mark their allegiance. In fact it’s illegal to use that particular shade of red on buildings not owned and operated by the state.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">The Campuses</span></p>

<p>Harmonium bases are known as campuses. Their primary use is as a parade ground but most have facilities for many other activities as well: Athletics, boxing, wrestling, riding, swimming, weapons’ practise, and various ball games. Large urban campuses like those in Harmony’s Glory or Han the Gen-Studded can accommodate an impressive fifty thousand citizens and are often used as the venue for major theatrical and sporting events – many of which have Harmonium sponsorship. More sedate pastimes are also available at campuses, such as debates and games of strategy. Outside of its military necessity, the Harmonium encourages visitors of all kinds to come, exercise their body and mind, see the benefits, and hopefully join up.</p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-weight:bold">Language</span></span></p>

<p>Local dialects are common but their variations are minor – mobile clergy, state officials, and Harmonium officers all speak a standardised common tongue, and all missives are printed in the single unified language of the Pax Harmonium. Regional variations can and do migrate into the common tongue however, usually descriptions of local customs or phenomena. Technically all such additions must be authorised by Harmonium linguistic experts and cannot be used officially until authorised (you still won’t find “short-cloak” in any official documents for example, despite two hundred years of common usage), but things creep in nonetheless.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div><span style="font-weight:bold">Glossary of Terms</span></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">“Coin polisher” </span>– a merchant, alternatively anyone with ideas above his station.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">“Huihui” </span>– worker’s union, also troublemaker/thug</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">“Prov” </span>– lower class worker dependant upon the Daily Provender for food. Also general term for a shiftless ne’er-do-well, criminal, or troublemaker.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">“Provender Run”-</span> Any job that is hard but shows little profit at the end; such as providing the Daily Provender.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">“Shortcloak” – </span>citizens who do a short two-year term with the Harmonium for the sake of respectability, especially soldiers on an easy posting like the Knights’ Roads or Licensed Quarter. Comes from the Harmonium practice of assigning its soldiers a short light cloak for use in summer time.</div></p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-weight:bold">The Law</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">“Convert. Recruit. Don’t execute.”</p>

<p>- Harmonium saying.</span></p>

<p>All Orthunian law is based upon principles found within the Seven Scrolls, a treatise penned by the four Knights together at the dawn of the Harmonium. It sets out the overarching principles of Orthunian international law, dictates to be accommodated into the legal system of each province, and provides the philosophical and moral basis of all future legislation. The Seven Scrolls state quite clearly that the Knights of Harmony and any organisation that succeeds them must be subject to these laws, that no intelligent being is innately more worthy than any other, and several other important foundations of Orthunian civilisation. Another important principle is that the courts do not recognise a person’s moral intent, only their proven actions. The law is the law – or to put it another way, murder is murder, regardless of your reasons. </p>

<p>Also central to the document is the principle of Private Law and Public Law: Private Law concerns the individual, while Public law concerns the good of society as a whole. </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div><span style="font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">Sample Laws:</span></p>

<p>It is illegal to enter of leave a city without your citizen papers</p>

<p>It is illegal to enter or leave the Licensed Quarter by any means other than the official gate.</p>

<p>Goods may not be moved by cart, wagon, or draft animal through the city concourses between the hours of midnight and the fifth hour of the morning.</p>

<p>It is illegal to light an allot by magic without prior permit</p>

<p>No unattended open fires within tenements.</p>

<p>Without a permit weapons may not be carried by citizens within city limits.</p>

<p>Possession of a semaphore codebook by those not directly involved in their use is a crime.</p>

<p>It is illegal to interfere with the operation of a semaphore tower or its personnel.</div></span></p>

<p>As the centuries have passed, Orthunian law has become further divided into various specialised disciplines: Land Law, Property Law, Provincial Law and Colony Law, Military Law, Religious Law, and Moral Law. A lot of Orthunian legal wranglings are concerned with exactly which doctrine a given crime falls under, as procedures and punishments differ in each area.</p>

<p>Cases are administered by a judge not a jury in most cases. Juries are generally only used when multiple bodies are involved in the trial. These come under Public Law and are judged by representatives from each pillar of state. Legal experts are permitted on both sides, always members of the Harmonium – specifically graduates from the School of Ethics. Most decisions are final. There are no appeals in Public Law, and they are discouraged in Private Law as well. All legal processes are scrupulously recorded. The verdict of all trials become part of a citizen’s Private notes. </p>

<p>Citizens without a criminal record are usually permitted their liberty before the trial unless precedent or circumstance demands otherwise. A citizen’s word is his bond in these matters, although their citizen papers are marked to limit their travel - and unofficially limit many other aspects of life. </p>

<p>Temporary or permanent demotion to non-citizen is a common punishment for those who have proved they cannot work within the system (persistent drunks, debtors, brawlers, and similar folk). The social stigma of this is often considered sufficient punishment for minor crimes. Those stripped of citizenship are officially called <span style="font-style:italic">Antipodes</span>. </p>

<p>Most Antipodes are serving a sentence at a Harmonium prison or re-education centre (the latter usually forming the end of a prisoner’s sentence). Orthunians believe that all criminals owe a debt to society, and that prisoners should work it off through hard labour. Prison factories (and prison farms) contribute a significant amount to the economy and the Daily Provender in particular. Unfortunately not all prisoners are treated equally; wealth is the determining factor - the prisoner or his friends and family can contribute a 'prison tithe' to the establishment that holds him, paying for better conditions, lighter work, and even earlier release. Although many people claim that this system is tantamout to bribery, the official stance is that the prisoners' contacts are just 'paying his debt to society' in ready coin. Only the most severe crimes - like treason - are exempt from tithing.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div><span style="font-style:italic">PCs can find themselves in the prison farm or prison factory for several reasons. They might be going undercover to talk to a contact, breaking out their comrades, trying to locate a map or treasure hidden somewhere within, or simply have committed some nefarious act and been pinched for it. </p>

<p>A campaign could even start with all the PCs being criminals planning a prison break – but why not reverse expectations and cast the party as guards? Loyal Harmonium soldiers keeping the inmates contained and controlled, producing vital goods, fighting crime and corruption on the inside, and maybe making a few converts as well.</span></div></p>

<p>In the rougher locales of the world (and off it), Harmonium recruiters sometimes visit prisons, looking for potential converts. Most criminals are initially inducted into special ‘felon units’ that are guarded throughout their duties and governed by only the hardest officers and harshest taskmasters in the Harmonium.</p>

<p>The Harmonium believes that it is better to convert and recruit than to execute, but some creatures are simply too dangerous to live. The method of executions varies from Province to Province, but is also ways public and comes swiftly after the trial ends – the Harmonium believes that justice should be seen to be done.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Citizen Papers</span></p>

<p>No member of the Pax Harmonium should be without their citizenship papers. A small wallet of thin red leather marked with the Harmonium seal, the papers within it detail a citizen’s name, family, rank, profession, registered home, and other pertinent information. An individual’s papers also record their criminal convictions and any commendations of awards they have received. </p>

<p>Papers are required to be presented at every city gate and checkpoint, in all legal proceedings, and before almost any official dealings with the state or Harmonium. Many merchants (especially innkeepers) also insist on an exchange of citizen papers during negotiations, and on the whole it’s impossible to carry on a normal life without them. While a person doesn’t have to carry their citizen papers around with them all the time, many do – they are a great source of pride, especially in newer colonies. Externals possess a variation on these papers, but Antipodes do not. Children are not given citizen papers, and in fact appear on the papers of their parents.</p>

<p>It is a crime to lose one’s papers, although given the sheer number of people in the Pax Harmony accidents do happen and the offence is minor… the first time anyway. Consistent inability to keep one’s citizen papers safe is grounds of demotion to Antipode.</p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-weight:bold">Religion</span></span></p>

<p>Religious responsibility is part of a good civilised life. This is not only a matter of moral purity, but of military resources. The Lords of Order are vital allies in the cause and every devout prayer to them is another small victory in the heavenly front against evil and divisiveness. Pious citizens in the Pax Harmonium should pray each day at the Prayer Hour (usually at their household shrine), and whenever their daily life intersects with the Gods’ primary influence. </p>

<p>All good citizens also pray on the assigned Holy Days of the Lords of Order; attendance isn’t actually compulsory, but repeated truants receiving the condemnation of their fellows and a visit from their local Harmonium or temple representative wanting to know why. Since most allots and tenements travel off together to pray, ducking this exodus can be a challenge.<br />
 </p>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><span style="font-weight:bold">Social Class</span></span></p>

<p>Under Harmonium law, no intelligent mortal being is innately more worthy than any other. All are legally equal under the law. This philosophy ran directly contrary to the laws and traditions of several nations, but the provinces have eventually been forced to adopt the new ways – by the letter of the law if not in its spirit. </p>

<p>Post-Harmony society remains strongly hierarchical, but it is also a meritocracy; even the humblest peasant could (in theory) rise to become a Composer – assuming of course, they join the Harmonium. As with the rest of society no actual law says that citizens must join, but public figures without at least a short stint in the Harmonium are viewed as untrustworthy by the populace, and severely lack financial and political support. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">The Nobility</span></span></p>

<p>Harmonium law may have said that no man was better than another, but it certainly didn’t share their assets out equally. The same noble classes remained in power across almost all of Ortho, because they still owned the land, had the wealth, and were best equipped to continue in their feudal role. More than a few families went bankrupt when slaves and serfs became paid employees, and these impoverished nobles formed the backbone of resistance to the Pax Harmonium for years afterwards. Most learned to play the system however, and continued to profit from it. All young nobles now attend the Harmonium academies as part of their upbringing, whether they continue in that service or not. The church is also a popular choice for advancement, but the bureaucracy is seen as “too merchant class” for their efforts – even by those nobles who are primarily merchants now. They prefer to enter politics from either a church or military background. </p>

<p>Social distinctions are now largely a matter of prestige. Dress and act and spend your money like nobility and you’ll be treated as such. This still horrifies many traditionalist families, who are appalled at the “new nobility” who have emerged; especially the rich merchants of what they call the “coin-polisher class.”</p>

<p>In many ways the Harmonium is the new nobility, a class of warriors who protect (and to an extent rule) the populace. In the face of this development, the old nobility have had to change.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">The Merchants</span></span></p>

<p>Seen as subservient lackeys to the nobility for generations, the middle class of merchants, bureaucrats, and professional military men have thrived in the Pax Harmonium. No longer were nobles above the law; no longer were men and women of ingenuity and virtue “kept in their place” by those above through legal and social restrictions. More than any other group in society, these people benefited from the new Ortho. In some places it was an uphill (sometime bloody) struggle – and in some places the weight of tradition is still against them – but on the whole they have prospered in both wealth and freedom. Many of them now even take the nobles’ old insult of “coin-polisher” as a compliment. </p>

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div><span style="font-style:italic"><span style="font-weight:bold">... and here it is</span></span></div></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Merchant Cartels</span></p>

<p>The craft and trade guilds found on other worlds were an unacceptable threat to the Harmonium’s power and had to be broken up. In their wake grew the Cartels – alliances of reputable merchants who combine their interests to better support the Harmonium and stabilise their respective markets. The cartels walk a narrow line between profit and harmony and mostly they fall towards the former, but they are also all conspicuous in their support for the Pax Harmonium.</p>

<p>Cartels are entirely unofficial organisations, but everyone knows who they are and can see their influence throughout Ortho. Each cartel operates in roughly the same way; in semi-independent layers, each more powerful and influential than the last. Regional leaders (sometimes known as ‘barons’) coordinate their industry within in a city, valley, or other area to ensure the maximum profit and maximum support from the government. They in turn answer to the next layer, which usually coordinates all the industry in a given kingdom, who are part of a cabal that controls trade across the whole Province. These men and women are known as ‘Merchant Princes’ and come together to decide the policies of their industry across Ortho and beyond. Competition is fierce, but in recent decades it’s not been uncommon for a single family to rise to prominence over the other Princes and Princesses, effectively controlling all a given trade across the Pax Harmony.</p>

<p>Perhaps surprisingly, the state finds this situation perfectly amicable. The cartels appreciate the peace and stability of the Pax Harmonium, and contribute many hundreds of thousands of gold pieces to the cause each year. Like the nobility, the cartel lords also send their children for induction in the Harmonium. Although few stay on in it for life, enough cartel men and women are full-time Harmonium that the government of Ortho (and the Harmonium in particular) feel that their loyalty and sense of responsibility is assured – it’s a rare day that the Provender is not contributed to by at least one cartel, for example. Its also been made abundantly clear to the Merchant Princes on many occasions that the day they stop being a support to the Harmonium is the day that cartel power comes to an end.</p>

<p>Cartel hierarchy is rather loose. Each cartel merchant is bound to those above him by financial obligations in a situation much like the old feudal system, but as long as each layer makes a profit, follows the policies sent down from above, and continues to enjoy the support of the government, individual cartel barons are largely left alone. </p>

<p>Many merchants involve themselves in intrigue and sabotage against rivals both within the cartel and outside it, providing a good living to mercenaries and other Free Folk who work for them. While these ‘Quiet Wars’ are subtly encouraged, cartels members who attract the attention of the Harmonium are swiftly and severely punished by their superiors: Debts are called in, patronage is withdrawn, favours refused… and when the fool goes out of business a more responsible replacement steps up to the task.</p>

<p>The wealth and influence of the cartels means they often get involved with local politics, generally providing financial support for policies and politicians they approve of. The honest poor, underworld, and Free Folk are all used by the cartels however, and have a much more dire opinion of them than the Harmonium and government. Many poor workers do backbreaking labour for low wages, and it’s cartel merchants that most <span style="font-style:italic">huihui </span>clash with. Adventurers and criminals are also regularly drawn into their intrigues. </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div><span style="font-style:italic">“Huihui” are originally from my lizardman write-up</span></div></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic"><span style="font-weight:bold">The Poor</span></span></p>

<p>By and large, the poor have remained the poor under the Pax Harmonium, but it would be unfair to say that nothing has changed: Many conditions have improved, not least of which is the Daily Provender that helps feed every man, woman, and child on Ortho and the colonies. The Harmonium isn’t very big on charity, but they are firm believers in an honest days work for an honest days pay. State, temple, and Harmonium strongly encourage the work ethic, but have forced many poor families into slums – both urban factory workers and rural Provender Farms.</p>

<p>Known as Provs because of their dependency on the Daily Provender, the lower classes have an underserved reputation as troublemakers prone to the lure of crime and moral weakness. In fact the disenfranchised are often simply too tired from a days labour to make any trouble or join the Harmonium. A few crusaders fight for more rights and better conditions, but the weight of the law favours owners, managers, and the cartels. The workers have had to seek other means:</p>

<p>A <span style="font-style:italic">huihui </span>is a worker’s association, from the word “me and you” from the lacerde (lizardman) tongue. Officially they are mere social organisations based around workers’ allots, but they fiercely defend their workers’ rights and apply pressure to employers for better conditions. ‘Pressure’ can vary from verbal negotiations to strikes (which are illegal), sabotage, and outright assault. Many huihui activities are illegal and it’s rumoured that their members often double as thugs for the underworld – which is the only way they can gain significant funding for their activities.</p>

<p>Service with the government, Harmonium, or churches can provide an escape for the poor, but many hardworking families simply can’t spare a son or daughter for the cause. Education is also a factor; although the Harmonium tries to provide education for all its people, literacy and schooling are often at a bare minimum. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">The Free Folk</span></p>

<p>Ortho’s ‘Free Folk’ are a remnant of many wandering cultures and independent peoples who struggle to maintain their freedom under the great world state – but working mainly within the system rather than against it. Most Free Folk are citizens not recanters, criminals, or antipodes – though these groups are also present, hiding from the law among the last free peoples of Ortho.</p>

<p>Free Folk can be found anywhere in the Pax Harmonium - as venture company men or cartel goons; as travelling troupes of actors or shiftless rogues working farm-roads and the shadowed corners of the plaza; as hunters, trappers, and adventurers in the wilderness; and as bandits, outlaws, and thieves. United only by their love of freedom and desire to survive, the Free Folk have traditions and customs as old and strong as the rest of Orthunian society. </p>

<p>Free Folk speak common like all good citizens, but they tend to mingle in traditional terms and expressions from their original cultures as well. Many speak the Quack, but they are most famous for their ‘language’ of trail signs and hand gestures, called <span style="font-style:italic">Gerare</span>.</p>

<p>The exact make-up of Gerare varies from continent to continent, but those proficient in its use can easily pick up local variants with a little practice. Gerare comes in two forms, signs that can be scratched on buildings or the dirt, and hand-gestures used to communicate silently. The signs are typically left at Free Folk encampments or scratched on compound walls. They mark various kinds of information aiding travellers on the road (<span style="font-style:italic">Shortcut</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">Bridge Unreliable</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">Dangerous Wildlife</span> etc) as well various secret information the Free Folk wish to pass on, things like <span style="font-style:italic">Harmonium Unfriendly Here</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">Corrupt Merchant</span>, or <span style="font-style:italic">Thieves Den Nearby</span>.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div><span style="font-style:italic">Most marks are made in a fairly obvious place by the side of the road, and require only a DC 10 or 15 Spot check to notice. Secret Marks are usually deliberately hidden from view – although Free Folk know where to look. To find these requires a Search check, DC 20.</span></div></p>

<p>Gerare has no spoken form, relying on quick and simple hand gestures instead. Only very basic ideas can be communicated in this way: <span style="font-style:italic">Stop</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">Leave</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">Trouble</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">Stay Quiet</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">Back Me Up</span>, etc. Most Harmonium officers are aware of the Free Folk hand code, but it’s not illegal.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div><span style="font-style:italic">Taking Gerare as a language automatically lets the character communicate simple messages by gesture. Doing so without being seen however requires a Bluff check opposed by the watcher’s Spot (see PHB, p68). Proficiency with the gerare language grants a +2 bonus to this roll, however. Of course, gerare can only be used if the target can see the ‘speaker’ clearly.</span></div></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Venture Companies</span></p>

<p>Venture companies are merchant adventurers, pure and simple. They carry goods throughout Ortho and her colonies, drawn as much by wanderlust and a sense of adventure as by the desire for profit. They often carry speculative goods or deal in cargoes and destinations that official Harmonium traders and the merchant cartels can’t be bothered with. </p>

<p>Venture companies are usually small, at least compared to the might of the Merchant Cartels. They often begin as nothing more than some determination, a couple of pack mules, and a trader’s licence. Most still consist of just a single caravan of horses or a couple of ships (maybe an airship if they’ve been very lucky). Respectable merchants have trade in major cities all sewn up, so the venture companies are more likely to be found in isolated villages and small towns near the edges of the map. Most operate at a profit margin that’s adequate rather than good, but to them the relative freedoms are worth their weight in gold. Only the poorest companies do the Provender Run or make long-term contracts with the cartels – they pride their independence too much.</p>

<p>Ventures take just about anybody into their ranks, no questions asked. More than one fugitive has found a home here, as long as he can keep his head down and not cause trouble in his new life; the companies have had a turbulent ride through the Harmonium’s history, and learned the hard way to play nice with their rulers. They avoid the Harmonium as much as possible, but when their paths do cross they work hard to maintain the reputation for honour they gained during the civil war. Ortho’s last lingering respect and affection for adventurers finds its home with these people and they’re generally determined to keep it. </p>

<p>In the backwater places that venture companies frequent, the Harmonium’s military presence is often minimal at best, so the companies have a reputation for dealing with problems for their customers – for a fee of course. This kind of extra work is common where the company has members who are former Harmonium, who feel honour-bound to help those they encounter. Companies without such connections keep their occasional mercenary work quiet and ‘off the books.’</p>

<p>Aside from the paperwork that’s required just about wherever you go on Ortho, the life of a venture company man is one of travel, freedom, and pure adventure: exploring the wilderness, opening up new trade routes, protecting goods and personnel from monsters and the occasional bandit, making new friends, and drinking with like-minded companions in taverns and inns across the world.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">The Underworld</span></p>

<p>With its massive manpower, generally supportive populace, and strong organisation, life is tough for criminals on Ortho. Massive criminal organisations are usually rare, as any gang large enough to become powerful is inevitably noticed by the Harmonium and dealt with using however much military force is required. When a criminal is discovered, it’s not just a matter of fleeing to the next town either: People have identification papers, recorded histories, and aren’t supposed to travel without good reason. The best defence for a rogue is to keep their head down and out of sight. “Honour among thieves” is no longer an irony - it’s a way of life.</p>

<p>The establishment of the Pax Harmonium effectively ended the existence of the established Thieves Guilds. They were too visible to be ignored, too numerous to hide from scrutiny, and too powerful to be left unchallenged. Almost all of the old thieves’ guilds were destroyed, but that doesn’t mean that their successors weren’t setting up shop again shortly afterwards.</p>

<p>An easy target for the Knights of Harmony, the underworld practically financed the cause when it was starting out. As part of the campaign to win hearts and minds, Knights would enter a kingdom and help its authorities eliminate the criminal guilds – then use the good feeling created and the treasure confiscated to fund further activities. Hundreds of thousands of gold pieces and countless magical items were taken into the cause this way.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div><span style="font-style:italic">Thieves of course, are a wily bunch. Many guildmasters squirreled away their fortunes in death-trapped dungeons and not all these hordes were uncovered. Its common folklore that beneath the streets are the forgotten secret chambers of master thieves just waiting to be found and plundered.</span></div></p>

<p>Many guilds went down fighting or scattered to the four winds, but the more cautious already had plans in place for such terrible events. They went to ground – for years in places – and reformed later as smaller groups, allied but independent and secretive as a matter of survival. Once Romhel and the others had moved on, more than a few realised that not all these ‘Knights of Harmony’ were as incorruptible as their founders. Many criminal organisations now have Harmonium connections; on Ortho even the lawless can be lawful.</p>

<p>Larger groups are still rare however, especially if they don’t have some legitimate connections. Most of the underworld operates in small isolated cells. They know a few contacts, fences, information brokers, and specialists – and these people in turn know more. Most people use aliases and live in constant fear of being uncovered, so a special class of criminal has arisen to unify the underworld. Common parlance calls them “Book keepers.”</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Book keepers</span></p>

<p>Book keepers are professional brokers, fixers and arrangers for the underworld. Each criminal gang likely knows one or two they can draw on. Book-keepers maintain records of successful criminals and gangs, and can put groups or individuals in touch with each other in exchange for a cut of any profits that result. Book-keepers have become the new rulers of the underworld, but their position is far more isolated and precarious than that of the thief lords they succeeded.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">“The Quack”</span></p>

<p>In the face of Harmonium scrutiny, modern rogues of Ortho have revisited an ancient tradition; its called the “thieves tongue” - a specialised way of communicating with their fellows that leaves innocent onlookers baffled or better yet, unknowing that anything unlawful is being discussed. </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div><span style="font-style:italic">‘Thieves Tongue’ is a language that can be taken by characters of any class, not just rogues. Being based on the common tongue, it has a written form. Knowledge of the Quack gives a +4 bonus when using Bluff to ‘deliver a secret message’ (see PHB p68), if successful those overhearing it will think it gibberish or Free Folk slang.</span></div></p>

<p>Its sometimes called <span style="font-style:italic">“The Quack” </span>– as in duck; not the bird but as in keeping your head down. In fact “not the bird” is a phrase meaning that the subject is “not one of us and not to be trusted”. This illustrates the basic principles of the thieves tongue: rhyming slang and innuendo used to replace any words that might send alarm bells ringing in those who overhear it. The Quack contains more than a few words of planar cant too, which leads the authorities to conclude that the underworld received or is receiving help from rogues of the outer planes.  They’re right.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Planar Rogues</span></p>

<p>Most planar rogues are firmly against the Harmonium. A few of them are prepared to take action to back up their beliefs – and it doesn’t hurt that Ortho is rich both in valuable technology and great stores of treasure stockpiled by the government. </p>

<p>The best book-keepers know a few ways to contact specialists with expertise far beyond the norm. They might be someone who knows someone with the appropriate summoning or contact spells, or more rarely a portal to the Outer Planes. Spelljamming criminals from other prime worlds also lurk in the shadows, and these are often harder to spot.</p>

<p>A band of planar thieves (of all classes) on Ortho would make for an exciting game full of suspicion, paranoia, and betrayal.</p>

<p>Planar rogues might also come of their own accord, but most simply stand out too much to survive on their own. Making contact with the underworld is one way for such interlopers (even those arriving by accident) can avoid contact with the Harmonium. </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div><span style="font-style:italic"><span style="font-weight:bold">ADVENTURE HOOKS</span>
An underworld book-keeper is robbed by an (un)lucky band of inexperienced thieves, who made off with his ‘account book’ – a list of past and ongoing jobs, including the cut he’s taken or expecting and the coded names/locations of several gangs and specialists: A highly valuable prize for the underworld or the Harmonium.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">A roguish PC is approached by a band of planar adventurers who have accidentally arrived on Ortho. The group is distinctive and definitely not friends of the Harmonium (Indeps, Chaosites, half-celestials of Eladrin blood) but insist that they’re just looking for a way home.</p>

<p>Just under a week ago the slums were sealed off by the Harmonium while the hunt for a “dangerous escaped reptile” went on (the PCs may or may not have been involved in this). The creature was apprehended but found to be red slaad, accidentally released by a gang of thieves who stole an Iron Flask. An Exigency Team - the PCs - are sent in undercover to find the thieves (who’ve since scattered), who the authorities suspect are infected with slaad pellets – if they’re not found in time, a plague of blue slaad will erupt in the area.</span></div></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">“Non-citizens”</span></p>

<p>Contrary to popular belief not everyone on Ortho is a citizen of the Pax Harmonium. Citizen is the rank that all good members of Orthunian society (and its colonies) are born with, but its privileges are not automatic. Those who act contrary to the common good can lose their status, and those born outside of the Pax Harmonium never have it in the first place. </p>

<p>Citizenship denotes a legal and moral commitment to the cause of Harmony and its champions. This is taught during a person’s upbringing both at home and school, and confirmed when they reach adulthood (their fifteenth year for humans) and receive the citizen papers that they will carry throughout their lives from then on. In theory a person has the right to refuse citizenship, voluntarily becoming a Recanter, but this is unheard of.</p>

<p>Citizenship can also be revoked by the courts – an act of Public Law that requires the consensus of judges from the three families of government. Persons stripped of citizenship are called Recanters or Antipodes and suffer significant legal restrictions as well as sometimes soul-crushing prejudice and alienation from the populace.</p>

<p>Non-citizens live in accommodation provided under the auspices of the Daily Provender – and the hope that they might one day be productive citizens again. Their allots are rarely better than slums – although some ‘Externals Quarter’ blocks can be respectable. Criminals not incarcerated are often indentured to a respectable patron who is responsible for rehabilitating them through hard labour and a constant doctrine of harmony. Abuses of this system have been known to exist, but for the most part the citizens of Harmony see Recanters as deserving everything they get.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Recanters &amp; Antipodes </span></p>

<p>An ‘Antipode’ was once the term for someone who actively opposed the Harmonium’s spread. As time went on however, it became the derogatory word for anyone who has had their citizenship stripped from them. These days all Antipodes are convicted criminals; debtors clearly unable to manage their own affairs, serving soldiers losing privileges for some infraction, or genuine rebels, criminals, and enemies. Antipodes are sometimes also known as Recanters.</p>

<p>Antipodes suffer all the regal restrictions of Externals, but they are also barred from making contracts with citizens, inheriting goods or land, and they may not travel without express permission from state authorities. </p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Externals</span></p>

<p>Externals are individuals born and raised outside the Pax Harmonium, who cannot be expected to know its laws and ways, or the peaceful benefits of harmony. They are accorded less rights under the law; in fact it treats them more like children than adults. </p>

<p>An External’s ability to contribute to society is limited. They cannot stand for office or hold any government rank. Many Provinces have their own restrictions on Externals as well. This rank is assigned to those few independent peoples of Ortho still outside the Pax Harmonium, as well as the rare visitors from other worlds and planes. New colonies also hold this rank. Integrated Colonies however, are considered Provinces and so they are citizens just like the people of Ortho.</p>

<p>Externals can be promoted to full citizenship in a variety of ways. Work in the government or church grants an individual automatic citizen-entitlement during their term of service, with permanent elevation automatic after ten years. Membership in the Harmonium results in immediate promotion to full citizen status, although thanks to the rigorous induction process this route is certainly no easy route.</p>

<p>Externals can also gain citizen papers through “outstanding actions in the service of harmony” – a matter arbitrated by the Provincial Harmonium leader. Often awarded posthumously to those who given their life for the Pax Harmonium, it is also given to select visitors from the Outer Planes – but only to firm friends and proven allies like the Fraternity of Order, Order of the Planes Militant, and certain exemplars.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Rebels &amp; Renegades</span></p>

<p>There has always been resistance to the Harmonium on Ortho, from the marching armies of Alzrius and the empire of Thaera to citizens who want more individual freedoms, to planar rebels seeking ‘the ultimate challenge’ against the forces of Law. They may live seemingly respectable lives elsewhere, but the underworld is where their beliefs live and breathe.</p>

<p>Very rarely a disgruntled citizen may renounce all faith and desire to participate in the Pax Harmonium. They are known as Recanters (see below) and must struggle amongst the poorest of the poor. Severely restricted by laws and social prejudice, it’s all too easy for Recanters to end up in the underworld or in a workhouse.</p>

<p>Antipodes are those officially stripped of citizenship for actions against the greater good; they are normally immediately apprehended and imprisoned, but a few escape outright or manage to fool the prison system into thinking they have seen the light. Most rebels are drawn from among their ranks, although the poor can sometimes be tempted into fighting directly to overthrow the current regime. </p>

<p>Most have an axe to grind against someone specific. There are rebel groups dedicated to bringing down the whole of society, just the church, just the merchant cartels, jus the beholders, and just the Harmonium. Some groups have a plan for afterwards, others do not. Some groups receive support from outside the Pax Harmonium (from other prime worlds or the Outer Planes), but most rely on crime to fund their activities. They are rarely effective; those groups that don’t break up or splinter in new factions are ruthlessly destroyed by the Harmonium when they surface. Most exist only for a mission or two before being rounded up.</p>

<p>By necessity most rebel groups are small and highly secretive. Unlike the underworld however, they have little in the way of camaraderie with other groups. Criminals are united at least by their desire for wealth; most rebel cells have ideological differences that put them at odds with even other rebellious types, and the Harmonium has forced them to live in a state of extreme paranoia as well.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Wow. Just wow. That's some great work Armoury. I only see a couple minor problems. </p>

<p>Firstly, there's a lot of a redundancy and over-explanation (you define the term "antipode" at least three different times, for instance). It's just a minor problem, but some "pruning" of the text would probably make it more concise and hopefully get it to a more managable length.</p>

<p>Secondly, you make the OCA seem a little bit harder on their farmers than they probably would be. I see no reason why they would want to impoverish their farmers, for instance, because small farmers presumably make up the bulk of the population. In fact, they have an Octave member devoted to insuring farmers get a fair shake and agrarian provinces like Xaric would want their farmers to be well taken care of. I personally see the provender farms as being paid fairly (if not generously) by the Harmonium, and I could even see the state bailing out the farmers on bad years. In an integrated economy like Ortho's, even the small ripples caused by a farm going out of business or farmers abandoning their land could be enough to cause starvation in the cities, and that is way more unrest than that OCA wants.</p>

<p>Thirdly, you say that the OCA has never been a big fan of democracy, but I don't really see that. The government they have now is fundementally democratic in structure, and most of the provinces have some semblance of representave democracy (even if it's a bit perverted in places). If anything I'd say the state is a strong <span style="font-style:italic">proponent</span> of democracy, at least in theory, and it's the provinces who are keeping them from making it official policy.</p>

<p>Finally, I'm glad you aren't falling head-first into the trap of making Ortho into an oppressive distopian hellhole, but you still sometimes portray the Harmonium as doing things that seem needlessly cruel or simply don't make a lot of sense. A good example of this are the absurdly long waits for those who get detained at Knight's Road check points. Sticking every traveler who <span style="font-style:italic">might</span> have something wrong with their papers in jail for a week or two is just plain stupid. I can see detention lasting as long as a few days if they're swamped, but after that they'd probably probably just let people go again unless they had a good reason to keep them. I mean, otherwise they'd run out of jail cells. Plus even anal-retentive Harmonium officers have better things to do than watch detained tourists at all times of day. I think a thing to remember about the Harmonium is that they are strict, intolerant, and sticklers to detail, but they're never actively trying to oppress people. Oppression leads to disharmony, disharmony leads to dissent, and dissent leads to chaos, and we all know what the Harmonium does to people who foster chaos.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Well, yeah, but the goal isn't to oppress them, it's to keep the peace by "removing" sources of dissent, and chaotic people are, almost by definition, sources of dissent.</p>

<p>The thing to remember is the Harmonium has the nasty habit of using evil means to achieve good(ish) ends, but their goals in and of themselves are rarely objectionable. I mean "spreading peace and harmony across an entire world" sounds like a good and noble pursuit, and it was, except for all the genocide.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Aye there's the rub with Harmonium policies.  If I learned anything from Star Wars, it's that if you don't wipe out a rebellion completely (nearly impossible), then the survivors only grow stronger and add more sympathetic allies to their cause.  I guess it's fortunate for the "harmony" of Ortho that many of the more free-willed races were eliminated.  The paladin who got this ball rolling in the first place has to be rolling over and over in his grave.  He would've already lost his paladinhood long ago if he wasn't already dead.</p>

<p>Or did he lose it and is he still around?  Has an Ex-Paladin/Lich running things behind the scenes idea come up before?</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>There's aways taking a number of wizard levels first before pursuing lichdom. Or instead whatever Lord Soth was, but that's a specific aspect of another setting.</div></p>

<p>You know the old saying: way to hell is laid by good intentions.</p>

<p>Lord Soth was a Death Knight, and they are craeted when powerfull sevitor of good (paladin or knight) is cursed by gods for their sins by undeath (lord Soth was punished for his zeal and wrath), but even if they become undead monsters they are allways tormented by their past (Soth was haunted by spirit of his love).  sob, sob :cry: </p>

<p>Another way of death knight creation is when powefull paladin pledge to service of dark gods in moment of his death.</p>

<p>I telling this because Harmonium death knights idea is not that stupid, because even good people sometimes go too far in their zael for geater good. Sometimes they go so far they could even be cursed for it.<br />
And there is nothig worse than undead villain who thinks he is dooing the right thing. </p>

<p>Bdw, death knigts are not Krynn specific undead (Kryn death knights are litle different than standard death knights, but diferences are minimal), Soth is just the most famous of them.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Its mentioned elsewhere that there are <span style="font-weight:bold">nine </span>different wizardly cabals on Ortho - or at least there once was - each following the principles of an aligment, but the only one I can pin down is the 9th - True Neutral. </p>

<p>Back in ancient times wizards ruled the world by all accounts, so there's plenty of excuse for magical knowledge and anicent liches from teh dawn of time... which is alwaays nice <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/lol.png" title="Laughing out loud" alt="Laughing out loud" class="smiley-content"/></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">On To Duckluck's Various Points:</span></p>

<p>Thanks for the feedback. As I try and answer Duckluck’s points, everyone bear in mind that a LOT of information on the Orthorian hierarchy is still undeveloped. We don’t officially know how things are structured yet or what the major policies are beyond “harmony.” That’s part of why I’m going to go into some detail here, but also why some/all of what I’ve written now or before might need changing eventually.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>…there's a lot of a redundancy and over-explanation (you define the term "antipode" at least three different times, for instance).</div></p>

<p>It’s a fair cop, guv.  :oops:  Some of the over-detailing is me just trying to get everything I can think of down, and to be honest I've chopped, cut, and pasted the article about a lot in the editing, so a few snafus were probably inevitable (frankly I was creatively dry by the end of the process and just couldn't face another read through either). I think that once the Ortho document gets updated again at least some of this post might end up pasted into different sections, but obviously I'll have a general prune when I edit up version 2.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>you make the OCA seem a little bit harder on their farmers than they probably would be. </div></p>

<p>The main problem here is geographic/cultural differences - farmers in Motmurk or Shoryko probably have a <span style="font-style:italic">very </span>different life to those in say, Harmony's Glory. I think that taken on average however, agriculture gets a bit of a raw deal: </p>

<p>It’s a hard decision, but to feed all those marching harmonium and hardworking citizens food has to be produced in bulk, shipped quickly, and above all be cheap. Farmers (and I suppose this applies much more to Provender Farms than independents) are simply expected to make sacrifices to keep civilisation afloat. Things are better in more benevolent areas and much worse in the evil provinces, but on average farmers are supposed to cope with being relatively poor in exchange for security and a job for life. It would be much worse for them to be poor in the cities, packed into a factory barracks or a crime-ridden tenement.</p>

<p>You make a good point about them having their own Composer. Even if Ruogassa isn't exactly a paragon of virtue, she does have a duty to do and an agricultural background. While I think that the average situation is probably as I described, the farmers should also get some other benefits I didn't include - more things like the free use of technological innovations, festivals to celebrate their essential contribution to the cause (which if nothing else the OCA would recognise), and other stuff that probably depends on the individual Province. I’ll try and work up something to edit in (damn, de-pruning already...) and post it up as a suggested answer, to give a more balanced view of farmers – unless we want them to oppress them?</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Thirdly, you say that the OCA has never been a big fan of democracy</div></p>

<p>Pending a more detailed breakdown of how the government is structured, I really don't think they are. To use an analogy that's been kicked around elsewhere in the project, I wouldn't say that the Chinese government are "big fans of democracy" either, even though they have some democratic systems in place.</p>

<p>To quote the first dictionary google threw up, democracy is <span style="font-style:italic">“a form of government in which the supreme power is vested in the people and exercised directly by them or by their elected agents under a free electoral system.”</span></p>

<p>Supreme power on Ortho doesn’t rest with the people, it rests with the Harmonium. Nor do they have ‘free elections’ – it’s a one party system and contrary doctrines are not tolerated (you can’t call Orthorian elections free unless the ‘Chaos Party’ and are allowed to run for office).</p>

<p>The OCA is certainly a meritocracy – it generally promotes by ability rather than birth or wealth – and it’s certainly democratic in the sense that society’s characterised by a formal equality of rights and privileges, both social and (at least within the established system) political, but democracies do have a tendency to end up as popularity contests with candidates in debt to their backers and more concerned with getting re-elected than with doing a good job… I think the Harmonium would prefer a situation where the people telling you what to do are professionals doing a job they’ve proven they have the authority to do, by good service and consequent promotion through the ranks. That’s not necessarily a bad thing – democracy is not innately Lawful or Good, that’s down to the people who run it. </p>

<p>I don’t think any of us had envisioned Composers and the like being elected by the populace in the way that – for example – US Presidents are; they’re promoted from within their various departments. Now the bottom rung of the state ladder is (as I’ve written it) based on public elections but from there on I’d imagined the process being more like corporate/military promotions. </p>

<p>Outside of major cities and the OCA, I can actually see a lot of elected officials: burgomasters, mayors, headmen, elders, senators, ministers, etc… so I’m not trying to eliminate democracy everywhere (again, maybe this needs to go in). </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>If anything I'd say the state is a strong <span style="font-style:italic">proponent</span> of democracy, at least in theory, and it's the provinces who are keeping them from making it official policy.</div></p>

<p>I think there’s certainly a pro-democracy lobby among the political factions of Ortho, and provinces influenced by that philosophy (like Osmopondia?) probably do have more elections. I don’t think that the Harmonium have any problem with most other political systems however - such as say the fantasy staple Feudalism - as long as the leadership is strong, the Laws of Harmony obeyed, and the feudal contract fairly upheld by both sides… I also see places like Han the Gem-Studded easily being plutocracies. The same applies to other socio-political systems: The Pax Harmonium is pretty much totalitarian, has a strong theme of pluralism (unification of state, Harmonium, and church, and Provinces), it’s certainly a believer in authoritarianism and collectivism, and has more than a few fascist ideals (minus the nationalism and racism). Part of the trouble we’re having is that Ortho actually has a brand new political philosophy called “Harmonism” that takes aspects of all the above theories.</p>

<p>(boy that’s a lot of isms)</p>

<p>There's been a tendancy in the gazetteers so far to equate Lawful Good with democracy. To my eyes the Harmonium are about unity and harmony and peace, and that includes accountability and meritocracy, but I’ve never seen them equate that to democracy as an operating principle (yet). What’s wrong with using local systems as long as it’s just and harmonious? To restate my point from above, political systems don’t have moral alignments.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div> I'm glad you aren't falling head-first into the trap of making Ortho into an oppressive dystopian hellhole, but you still sometimes portray the Harmonium as doing things that seem needlessly cruel or simply don't make a lot of sense. A good example of this are the absurdly long waits for those who get detained at Knight's Road check points. Sticking every traveller who <span style="font-style:italic">might</span> have something wrong with their papers in jail for a week or two is just plain stupid.</div></p>

<p>Papers in order? Valid reason for travel? Then there’s no reason to hold you. If you’re a good citizen and you play by the rules, you should never get delayed for more than a few hours – and only then because the people being expedited have a valid reason to be allowed ahead of you. </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>…they are strict, intolerant, and sticklers to detail, but they're never actively trying to oppress people. </div> </p>

<p>In my defence: They’re strict, intolerant, and sticklers to detail  <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/lol.png" title="Laughing out loud" alt="Laughing out loud" class="smiley-content"/>  - a “few days delay” now and then while your status is confirmed seems a small price to pay (from the Harmonium’s point of view) for the peace and security enjoyed by the populace. And remember that if you’ve been stopped it’s because something about you didn’t check out. Bureaucracy works slowly and better safe than sorry is probably the order of the day. </p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">- Say you’re travelling from Motmurk to Harmony’s Glory, by way of a small business stopover in Han the Gem-Studded. As you arrive in Han however, the checkpoint guards stop you suspecting that your papers are forged. The first thing they do is send a message to your Provincial Archive - where your Sealed &amp; Private Notes are kept - to check that you’re not a criminal ineligible for travel. They also contact your port of origin with a description to see if it matches any known felon who might be fleeing justice from there (the port in turn contacting neighbouring boroughs for information). Since the semaphore system doesn't extend across the seas, they’ll have to rely on either a courier or magic for this, but the records themselves will still need fetching/checking by a clerk at the site). </p>

<p>They also send ahead to Harmony’s Glory to confirm that you’re expected there on business; this happens primarily by semaphore, but there are other messages that take priority (unless there’s a known dangerous criminal on the loose) as well as paying customers – which also apples to the (generally limited one way or another in the rules) magical resources. The Harmonium don’t consider checking your paperwork a priority because its probably just a mistake and *you* are the one who's fault it is that the paers are damaged/forged (becuase the Harmonium system is obviously perfect).</p>

<p>When all this has been confirmed the checkpoint officer completes a report, amends your travel papers accordingly (so the problem shouldn’t happen again), gets you to countersign the report (which gets added to your Sealed Notes for a while), and then finally says “goodbye and sorry for the delay” – see how that could take a while? Note that all of the above assumes the bureaucracts/harmonium involved aren't lazy, inept, or corrupt (or god forbid a member of the Shoryko HIstorical Society...)</span></p>

<p>Of course, this sort of mistake isn’t supposed to happen very often – unless you really are using faked papers. Having had a similar experience to the one above in  the real world in Europe the problem took 24 hours to sort with the aid of modern technology (although they told me it could be 48!) so I'd expect the Orthorian authorities to be a lot slower than that.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Back to the point...</span>But maybe I made the checkpoints sound a bit too harsh. Nothing says that your incarnation is horrible at a checkpoint however; it might just be “secure accommodation” or having your travel papers removed from you (effectively trapping you at the checkpoint). Sat around guarding merchants and pilgrims all day might seem like a waste of Harmonium soldiery, but that’s why the duty often goes to “shortcloaks.”</p>

<p>At the core of this is issue is whether the Harmonium encourages or discourages travel. There’s a definite argument that racial integration encourages unity, but it’s also a source of ghettos and social isolation – so that’s an awful lot of messing with Provincial policies just on a hope. An opposing view would be that things are supposed to be the same everywhere (all good) so you shouldn’t <span style="font-style:italic">want </span>to travel - you should stay where you are, do what you’re told, and be happy. Land rushes and sudden influxes of immigration/emigration are chaotic and unbalancing to the carefully crafted economic harmony. </p>

<p>Giving this weighty consideration… personally I think we’re probably best going with the more benevolent general attitude to travel. As Duckluck pointed our it’s all too easy to make the Hardheads nasty and oppressive.</p>

<p>As to other general harshness, it’s certainly easier to stress the negative aspects of the Harmonium than the positive (cynical old me). On the next draft I’ll try and strike a balanced view of everything, but in the main Ortho’s “problems” are probably the same as any other massive organisation – the little people tend to get overlooked, grand ideas cause unexpected problems when implemented, and bureaucracy gets tangled and slooooooooow (trust me, I’m a bureaucrat). </p>

<p>Do you have any other examples of “not making sense” or “needless cruelty” – it might be that I’ve a good reason in my head that I didn’t put down. In many cases, it'll probably just be the standard problems of a large imperson authoritarian organisation overlooking the harm its policies do. I guess I’m writing about the worse case scenarios in general too – so maybe I should add the “best case” from time to time as well.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Final note: </span>'Life In The Pax Harmonium' probably needs several 'Life in the Provences' sidebars, explaining any significant deviations from the norm, eg. Shoryko's dislike of foreigners.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

          Ortho: Life In The Pax Harmonium        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>On the farming point, you're right that the Provender farmers probably wouldn't be paid all that well, but they certainly would be paid well enough to keep them from leaving the fields. I see farming on Ortho as steady, secure work that can lead to prosperity if not great wealth (unless you're a big plantation owner), but still pays well enough so that you don't have to sell the farm after one bad harvest (and if you did the Government might bail you out). I also see Ortho as having a really powerful agricultural lobby.</p>

<p>On the issue of Democracy, I see the ideal Orthorian state as being a Federalist Democratic Socialist Meritocracy, or something like that. The Orthorian ideal is that the people choose who governs their province in a democratic manner (which only actually happens in about half of them) and then the popularly chosen government chooses three representatives to sit on the Council of Ortho. The general notion is that since these representatives are being chosen by a competent government in order to advance their people's interests, they should be as effective at their jobs as possible. Therefore, the Councilors should, in theory, be among the best men, women, and things in their province. It's not a perfect system, but the Councilors do tend to be fairly competent. The Councilors, for their part, vote to elect all the members of the Octave, and in rare cases (I imagine) have to power to remove them again. The selection of Octaves is ostensibly based on merit, but a quick survey will show that most got the job because of personal maneuvering or the political climate of the time. If the Provincial governments were democratically elected, the whole system would be a successful (if somewhat top-heavy) representational democracy. As it is, about half the provincial governments have a vested interest in discouraging democracy, so things will probably stay in their partially democratic form until something happens to shake things up.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Regarding the farmers, I think we're coming to an accord. Version 2 will feature farmers getting 'the short end of the stick' <span style="font-style:italic">a bit</span>, but with a powerful lobby in the Council and a system that (when it works) compensates and supports them in many ways to alleiviate any suffering caused by their relative lack of income... its just easily abused by corrupt, uncaring, or oppressive regimes.</p>

<p>If anyone has more specific ideas how the OCA can make the life of farmers more tolerable btw, I'm open to suggestions.</p>

<p>...whereas I'm championing an an <span style="font-style:italic">Authoritarian Federalist Socialist Meritocracy</span>. I envision elections occuring at local level, up to say mayoral rank. But from here on up its handled (in a largely competent and meritocratic way) by the layer of the OCA above it: the corporate/military style appointments I was talking about earlier.</p>

<p>But a least we agree that its a Federalist Socialist Meritocracy! </p>

<p>With no evidence to my eyes of democracy (in the electoral sense) within "the guardians of ethics and ideals" of the Pax Harmonium (the Harmonium itself), why would the Orthorian ideal be particularly democratic? The Harmonum pjilosphy is basically that Lawful good is the best alignment and everyone has to follow our interpretation of it or else. The Harmonium (and its partners the temples and state) know what's best for you, so you should be content with their judgement. </p>

<p>I don't think they have any problem with citizens getting involved in the government at local level, but I think they'd want major decisions firmly within their control. <span style="font-style:italic">"If you want to have a voice further up than that citizen, please join the Harmonium, the clergy, or the government; when your record warrants it you'll be promoted to the rank you deserve and are capable of handling."</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Hello anybody else out there with an opinion? </span>I think that basically Duckluck believes elections should be an operating principle of the Pax Harmonium, while I think it should be a central authority.

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>The thing to remember is that in Ortho supreme power is not vested in the people but in the provinces. Many great Orthorian thinkers, as well as many passages in the Way of Harmony itself have probably argued that in order for a system to be truly harmonious, everyone needs a voice, which would mean full democracy. On the other hand, Orthorian federalism allows the provinces to choose their governments however they like. The people in the democratic provinces don't like it, but it's not like the monarchs of places like Shoryko or Voll are going to say "You know what, let's try this democracy thing" and step down.</p>

<p>As for the top-down/bottom-up question of rule, the councilors are clearly chosen by their provinces (bottom-up) and Clueless and I more or less decided that they choose the Octave (bottom-up). In the provincial governments, it can be bottom-up, top down, or a combination of both depending on the local government. In the Harmonium, it's top-down, but the very top (the two composers) is chosen by the council. The clergy works the same way.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>I realise the irony of this statement but- I'll place a vote for a central authority.</p>

<p>I agree with Armoury that the Harmonium would prefer to progress their leaders slowly through the ranks of bureaucracy rather than risking chaos entering their system in the form of a charismatic, popular leader with unstable policies.</p>

<p>While a democratic policy at low levels would be pursued to give citizens a sense of entitlement I agree that higher levels would have required that people work with the system- which has already been established as correct.</p>

<p>This system actually encourages citizens to become more involved in the decision making process because you can't merely turn up on election-day and make a judgement. If you want to be a part of the decision making process the Harmonium/government's happy to have you on board, if you don't want to join then you obviously have dishonourable intentions anyway.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Wow. Ok - I need to get caught up with this obviously - lots of philosophy involved here.</p>

<p>It may be worthwhile to consider what the original founders would have encouraged or even been forced to arrange. The original alliance of orc and human and beholder placed it's own requirement on the creation of the system. These allies wanted to have their own 'turf' secured legally - and this includes provincial governments that will be different from each other. The idea of surrendering all of their personal governing power as leaders of nations to this order - the Knights of Harmony (of which they weren't even members!) would have been absurd. And would still be considered absurd by colonies looking to join - there's no reason to turn off nations you are trying to recruit.</p>

<p>I'm inclined towards the local province, in whatever way is correct locally - determining who the representatives for the province will be. Applying the principle of local mores and traditions holding some precedence, so the provinces are given some free rein on how they want to run themselves internally - so long as they interact with the federal government in the same way as every other province does.</p>

<p>When it comes to federal - power should still come up from below - though this is probably a weakening element as centuries have passed. Yes, it is vulnerable to a charismatic person but that's ok - like I said, this may be a threatened principle. Remember - the Harmonium is *not* the same thing as the OCA. Why would the military branch have control over the ranks of political representatives as it seems to be implied here? And why would the OCA design itself on a fairly rigid structure, vulnerable to purse string controls, disconnect from local/province needs, and low turn-over rate in the higher ranks causing glass ceiling effects? Representatives are a very different beast from trained consultant or research department - and representatives have plenty of access to trained people to advise them. Chaotic influence from a wildly popular representative is already being controlled by controlling the mindset of the populace. The OCA is nothing if not subtle when it comes to long term control and it is easier to control a populace that hands you their leash than one you must cage to be assured of their loyalty.</p>

<p>Now one meta-game reason I would suggest that we need to allow provinces to have a bottom-up election is to provide the opportunity for players to affect something on a sizable scale. It's good fodder for satisfying plot hooks - not every player will understand the subtle changes of getting a guy elected to the school board - but they*will* get what they've done if it's a position for governor. Similarly if someone is elected who shouldn't have been, the infighting from that provides plot hooks as well.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Damn, for a moment there Azrael and I had Duckluck outnumbered! </p>

<p>Nice to see you back here Clueless. Let me just martial my arguments… and in the meantime, here is some propaganda:</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">I cannot accept or condone a political system that would elect a tyrant or fiend as equally as a good man. It is an abdication of responsibility in the name of freedom, a retreat from evil for fear that men inevitably become tyrants when given power. I do not believe that. It is a disservice to legions of good men and women working hard throughout the world. </p>

<p>We cannot allow such a precious and important a thing as the world’s leadership to be decided by systems laced with patronage, nepotism, and corruption. By systems slick with empty promises or rulership without the right to rule. By systems peopled by those who believe more in the value of charisma than of virtue. By those who seek the role only to enjoy its power for as long as possible, and who exclude great swathes of their own population from a process they claim is fair and free. Be it the stately democrats of Osmopondia or the chieftain-councils of Motmurk, in every country that we visit I see people excluded from participating in political events because of age or gender; Race or skin colour; wealth, social status, or profession.</p>

<p>The Knights of Harmony propose a better way than this. No longer will the unscrupulous be able to profiteer through lies and promises. No longer shall they rule through bribery and corruption. No more shall the right to command depend on wealth or mere circumstance of birth, or on the tyranny of violence. In the new age of Harmony we are bringing about, authority shall be earned only through dedicated service to the cause and ability proven under the stern examination of one’s peers. So shall it be from the lowest-ranked scribe to the highest office of the land, and all mortal thinking beings will be free to join us in governance.</p>

<p>The Knights of Harmony have guarded you from the terrors of the Abyss and driven the foes of peace from the land. Now we will guard you as rebuilding begins. Never again will you fear the tyrant, the imbecile, the corrupt. We will stand beside you, watch you, guide you. Today and forever after, we will stand together.</p>

<p>In our new society the world shall be upheld on three pillars of government: The Pillar of the Body, the Pillar of the Mind, and the Pillar of the Soul. </p>

<p>The Pillar of the Body shall keep us fed and clothed, lawful, and gainfully employed. As we are of one peace, so too shall we be of one nation. Where once there was coercion, bribery, and competition, the Pillar of the Body shall bring unity, cooperation, and above all peace.</p>

<p>The Pillar of the Soul shall keep us from sin and blasphemy, both in the hearts of men and when its agents come from the Planes Beyond. And they shall render also unto us the gentle touch of forgiveness and the smiting fist of justice, that all may know that each of our neighbours is a being of good conscience. </p>

<p>Between these two stands the Pillar of the Mind, not to separate them but to bind them together and lend strength to both. The Pillar of the Mind shall guard the ideals of peace, stability, and harmony – and keep us ever focused on spreading the word. This shall be the duty of the Knights of Harmony, and those who come after us. Guardians and champions of this fragile thing called peace.</p>

<p>Body, Mind, and Soul – unified. Man, Province, World – conjoined. Peace, Prosperity, and freedom – achieved for all. Join us now as we embark upon this great adventure, to build a better world.</p>

<p>- Introduction to ‘The Three Pillar’s of State’ by Romhel of Voll</span></p>

<p>Pretty blatantly pro-Authoritarian I know… But I really wanted to try and capture why a Paladin would support such a state. Now on to more productive matters!</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>When it comes to federal - power should still come up from below</div></p>

<p>Roughly what are you thinking about when you talk about Federal power “coming up from below” – when I think of federal powers, my first thoughts are of government organisations and departments, where people are assigned rather than elected. What sort of things are you thinking of? </p>

<p>Was it something something similar to the "people's tribune" of Rome?</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Representatives are a very different beast from trained consultant or research department - and representatives have plenty of access to trained people to advise them. </div></p>

<p>Then why bother with representatives at all? Keep the populace’s involvement at local level where the policy impacts, but use the real experts directly higher up? I think basically this will come down to a matter of personal taste. Guess it depends on what you had in mind for the question above.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Why would the military branch have control over the ranks of political representatives as it seems to be implied here? </div></p>

<p>Because the Harmonium is a political party, and the military is only part of it. Of course it totally dominates the military, and even has a military-style hierarchy, but not all Harmonium will be military officers.  Every member will have done the [proposed two year] basic term of service, but afterwards they could have numerous civilian positions.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>why would the OCA design itself on a fairly rigid structure, vulnerable to purse string controls, disconnect from local/province needs, and low turn-over rate in the higher ranks causing glass ceiling effects? </div></p>

<p>Perhaps they weighed up the problems of both systems and in the end would rather have the authoritarian system above than the election-based one? This certainly might be the desire of the OCA rather than the Knights themselves however (and not what was actually put in place originally). In fact, as I write this it might well have been a secondary cause of the Schism – Julhien’s writeup certainly implies he was in the ‘minimal local power’ camp; many people might have seen the rebellion as a matter of federalist principle, rather than religion.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">And Finally</span></p>

<p>Once the above clarifications are in, I thought I might work up a brief and simple to do list for Ortho’s government. A list of what we’ve so far all agreed on, what so far is contentious (less than first appearances suggest, I think), and which specific areas we need to thrash out – suggestions welcome!</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Here's the deal. When we say Ortho is a federal system, that means it is a union of states with a central government -- a federation. The emphasis is on the "union of states" part. What you seem to be forgetting is that the base unit of power in the OCA is the province. The government <span style="font-style:italic">was not</span> created by the Knights conquering everyone and setting up whatever government they wanted -- even Romhel couldn't have pulled that one off. It was created by the allied states after they defeated the elves. Romhel's Knights became the military because they were the only ones everyone trusted, but to say that the king of a single nation (a powerful one admittedly) could get every major power on the planet to swear fealty to his organization just by pontificating on the need for order and shaking his sword a bit is absurd. </p>

<p>Since the OCA wasn't created from the top down, it makes no sense for it to be ruled from the top down. The provinces -- who formed the government to advance their own interests -- would never allow the government to overwhelm them and pursue its own interests above theirs. Julhien took away some of that control, but he couldn't change the fundemental structure of the government without alienating the few allies he had left. Basically, there's no top-down rule because there is no top to be ruling down from. The Harmonium has a lot of power, but its leaders (like all Octaves), are chosen by the Council of Ortho, and tend to do what the Council tells them to do. After all, if the provinces weren't assured of their control over the Octave, they would never have formed one in the first place.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Sorry for the delay in reply folks. My PC accidentally dumped the file and I had to start again from scratch… Please indulge me if I repeat myself a bit, it’s only because I’m replying to specific points with answers that apply to multiple questions/comments.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div><span style="font-weight:bold">Duckluck wrote:</span>

Actually I’m not forgetting anything. I simply think you're wrong and here’s why:</p>

<p>For the record, I agree that Provinces have discretion to govern and administer their own internal affairs, as long as they comply with Harmonium policies. I don't want to imply that the Harmonium <span style="font-style:italic">as a group</span> runs every level of government in each Province. <br />
		<br />
I think that 99% of the ruling class in each Province <span style="font-style:italic">are </span>members of the Harmonium, but that's not to say committed, ranked, or in a Harmonium job whose remit is to rule; they're just members of the political movement ('The Party' in communist terms) which is essential to getting on in Orthorian life. I’m suggesting that the Harmonium as a group merely oversees many aspects of government in much the same way that the presence of UN inspectors ensures fair play in the elections of various countries. Let me stress that in most places however, the Harmonium isn't expecting any trouble and their presence is treated as just another part of the bureaucratic process.</p>

<p>But Provinces aren’t nation states. Provinces are the basic <span style="font-style:italic">administrative </span>division, but even most Provinces will be divided into individual nations with their own systems. We can't equate Province to nation, because the write-ups indicate that most Provinces contain several nations (everything from Osmopondian city states to Xaric’s three racial nations, to the now united tribes of Motmurk and so on). In fact each group of nations is going to have to work out who represents the Province to the Council of Ortho, in what are probably lower-level versions of the Council – either based on existing alliances or set up directly by the Harmonium, as they did in Xaric. </p>

<p>But individual nations still aren't sovereign powers in the way that you claim, because they can accept no political ideology except the Harmonium, hold no ‘free elections’ (as we’d define them in the modern world), or endorse any religion or policy except those approved of by the Harmonium. According to the write-up, Provinces are allowed self rule if they demonstrate that they can be Harmonious, but this power can be revoked if they fail or backslide. See my remarks on colonies and provinces below for the appropriate quotes.</p>

<p>They can’t be like the member countries of the European Union, who have various powers of veto and can (and do) withdraw from various aspects of European policy or from the Union itself. I don't think that Motmurk alone, for example, has the power to declare war on the Abyss, or to issue a statement of neutrality when everyone else does, nor any vetoes and exemptions from Harmonium policy. Many of the responsibilities of national government are handled by the OCA instead (like external wars and global economic policy). Provinces just administrate it internally, using their own system. Each Province is essentially subservient to the will of the Harmonium in these matters, and I don't think anyone's under the impression that they'd be allowed to <span style="font-style:italic">leave </span>the Pax Harmonium either. That’s why I believe power can’t rest with the Provinces in a federation of nations as you describe.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div><span style="font-weight:bold">PDF, p25</span> 
[The Council of Ortho) is a representative council that passes laws and determines provincial governmental projects and budgets for the entire planet. </div></p>

<p>In my view, Provinces are essentially 'states' in the US sense of the word: There's a local culture and consciousness, and it has the power to act independently on local issues and set internal social and economic policy, but its just one part of a greater political entity and possesses few of the full national powers that it had previously. The OCA (in which each nation will obviously have some involvement) deals with larger scale policies on behalf of the Harmonium, so individual rulers and Provincial representatives can have power on the global stage, but both their remit and the high-level policy decisions come from the Harmonium (from the Octave, if you accept the principle that they are the commanders of each major aspect of the Harmonium) - or from the Council or Ortho if we use that. The Council is made up of representatives of each Province (not 'each nation in every Province'), so even if its the CoO making the decisions its still not a direct alliance of nations.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div><span style="font-weight:bold">Duckuck wrote:</span>
The government was not created by the Knights conquering everyone and setting up whatever government they wanted</div></p>

<p>Actually, yes it was. </p>

<p>What the Knights of Harmony effectively said was that each kingdom had to be subservient to their philosophy (not an individual, and certainly not Romhel as Emperor). As long as the rulers were OK with that, they could administer it pretty much as they wished. For those who refused this however, they applied other methods. I think I've clarified much of this above. Individual states that the Knights approved of continued largely unchanged, with just a few advisors to ensure everything really was as it was supposed to be (probably originally the Knights themselves and their cohorts).</p>

<p>I'll explain at some length below <span style="font-style:italic">why </span>it was clearly a matter of conquest <span style="font-style:italic">and </span>conquest.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold"><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Duckluck wrote:</span>It was created by the allied states after they defeated the elves. </div></p>

<p>Voll, Motmurk, and Thaera defeated Iathra. Then Voll, Motmurk, and Iathra conquered Theara. That’s clearly spelled out in the chronology. By the time the Harmonium was up and running the crusade was underway on a global scale, and the Knights had a significant amount of land and populace with which to exert pressure on their neighbours. This wasn't a decision of all nations, it was a crusade of the Knights of Harmony and their followers, which other nations were invited to join. I'm not suggesting that their expansion policy was a simplistic as "join us or die" - we know that later expansion included both diplomacy <span style="font-style:italic">and </span>war, but I've not read anything that suggests the Pax Harmonium was formed in a similar way to the League of Nations or United Nations – quite the opposite (we know they warred with and inspired coups against regimes that wouldn’t accept them). </p>

<p>‘Pax Harmonium’ was a philosophy that other nations - including the lawful and good - either accepted or fought against. It was to one extent or another forced on everyone for the good of Ortho; “Crusade” really is the best term for it in my opinion – it’s a ‘faith’ that every nation had to accept for the greater good. </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div><span style="font-weight:bold">PSCS, Chapter Three</span> (The Harmonium) 
– also <span style="font-weight:bold">Ortho PDF, p181 </span>
It was hard work, and sometimes the Knights even found themselves fighting others that were good and lawful. Romhel was saddened by these misunderstandings; how could two peoples, both essentially good and lawful, fight each other?</div></p>

<p>I think it's important to stress again that I'm not talking about the Knights ruling these nations, only making sure that they worship the correct gods and are administered in a Harmonious way. The section on Harmonium expansion via spelljamming (starting on p191) includes a broad description of the kind of techniques used by the Harmonium to convert its neighbours, and it’s probably based on the Knights/early Harmonium’s own experiences.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div><span style="font-weight:bold">Duckluck wrote:</span>

<p>Why is conquest an "absurd" explanation when it appears ubiquitously throughout human history? Romhel (and the others) clearly did not just pontificate and "shake his sword a bit" - Romhel shook his sword a whole lot, and did a lot more practical things with it than that: </p>

<p>This sort of quote is the information I'm basing my opinion on. It seemed pretty obvious to me from numerous comments in the text like those above, and I also think it matches the 'My Way or the Hard Way' approach of the Planar Harmonium. On this second point, I’m aware that the PS Faction is actually only a <span style="font-style:italic">part </span>of the Harmonium story and we're adding depth and detail to their background, but the project is about creating the <span style="font-style:italic">Harmonium Home World </span>and so we have to assume that Ortho’s feel would be generally the same as that of the Faction. </p>

<p>The Harmonium says there's only one way to have peace: their way… If it takes thumping heads to spread the truth, well, the Harmonium's ready to thump heads. Sure, there may not be peace right away, but every time the Harmonium gets rid of an enemy, the multiverse is that much closer to universal harmony </div></p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div><span style="font-weight:bold">PSCS, Chapter Three</span> (‘The Harmonium’)
[The Knights of Harmony] vanquished evil after evil, the kings of Ortho swore allegiance to them. Wherever a king would not pledge himself, the Knights found a noble that would, and supported their claim to the throne. In time, the Knights of Harmony united all of the planet, even the so-called “monster races” such as the beholders, under one banner, so that the peace they created would last forever. This government they called the Harmonium.</div></p>

“Make peace not war or I'll kick yer ass!”</div></p>

<p>The feel of the Faction certainly isn't one of ‘a democratic federation of nations.’ It’s universal peace through militant and militaristic organisation – and the conversion, conquest, or elimination of everyone who refuses to join them. That's the design principle I'm coming from. I'm not saying 'no democracy' or that they’re just bullies – but compromise and acceptance of other viewpoints are not among their fundamental principles. </p>

<p>Also see the section on Provinces as colonies below for more justification of this theory.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div><span style="font-weight:bold">Duckluck wrote</span>
... even Romhel couldn't have pulled that one off. </div></p>

<p>The Knights of Harmony (all four of them, not just Romhel) pacified the world by means of a prolonged campaign that included military might, threats, exploitation of local politics, and also diplomacy. I don't see any reason why they couldn't "pull it off" when this is exactly the combined campaign that historical conquerors have been pulling off since time immemorial. There's no reason that a paladin couldn't engage in warfare, even proactive warfare, if the cause was just and the methods honourable.</p>

<p>Of course it's unlikely that the <span style="font-style:italic">real </span>world would have been unified in such a way, but there are enough examples from earth of kingdoms rising up to conquer <span style="font-style:italic">"all of the known world"</span> that I certainly wouldn't consider the notion "absurd" – knowledge, distance, and communication were the chief barriers to conquering the whole world in our history; the only assumption I'm making for Ortho is that a (presumably magical) infrastructure existed allowing the Pax Harmonium to function beyond the distance that historically limited such things here on earth (and I don’t think that’s any more of a stretch than saying that every nation of the world is part of a single political federation either – especially since <span style="font-style:italic">we </span>haven’t managed that on earth yet). Empire formation by war and conquest is the historical model for the approximate time period upon which the setting is based (and long before and after it), and thematically appropriate for a genre which has always featured crusades and massive armies out to conquer the world. </p>

<p>The formation of states by peaceful consensus alone is a very modern idea, and part of the reason that associations such as the UN and European Union struggle with leadership and effectiveness issues. This kind of potential paralysis is exactly why the Harmonium prefers a strong hierarchy, which is commonly associated with communist politics and command economics, where (not necessarily unelected) power comes from the centre. </p>

<p>I'm not suggesting that the there weren't any compromises and diplomacy involved with bringing in some of the countries, only that this was only one aspect of the strategy. There almost certainly was a 'conclave of nations' at some point - but the opinion of the Knights of Harmony was that <span style="font-style:italic">ultimately vou will ioin us, one wav or another</span>. This seems to fit far more with the feel of the Harmonium information that already exists (to paraphrase Clueless on another thread "we like good, but in practice we're more interested in Order than Goodness") and the middle two quotes from the PDF given above. </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div><span style="font-weight:bold">Clueless: </span>
The original alliance of orc and human and beholder placed its own requirement on the creation of the system. These allies wanted to have their own 'turf' secured legally - and this includes provincial governments that will be different from each other. The idea of surrendering all of their personal governing power as leaders of nations to this order - the Knights of Harmony (of which they weren't even members!) would have been absurd. </div></p>

<p>Agreed, but I think that 'some power' in exchange for security and support isn't out of the question and as I mention elsewhere here, except in the case of enemies of the Harmonium local governments would continue as before with only minor changes and some Harmonium officials to witness that its all being done fairly - and nothing says that the overseers can't be local either. It’s “the carrot and the stick” approach, whichever works best with each nation. Obviously they’d prefer to get agreement and cooperation and would almost always make friendly overtures initially, but the PDF says that ultimately the Knights were prepared to see obstinate rulers overthrown and create more sympathetic regimes. That’s a powerful threat, especially if you consider that it’s coming from the heroes of the war against Alzrius and the combined military might of Thaera, Iathra, Voll, Heka, and Motmurk.</p>

<p>The Knights and their successors would certainly have stressed that local (harmonious) customs and traditions and legal powers are the jurisdiction of local nations however, unless they impact upon the “greater good” that’s looked after by the Harmonium and the OCA. The main cause of Julhien’s civil war in the writeup is that he starts to define everything as under the ‘greater good clause’ (so the principle clearly existed at the time for him to abuse)</p>

Applying the principle of local mores and traditions holding some precedence, so the provinces are given some free rein on how they want to run themselves internally - so long as they interact with the federal government in the same way as every other province does. </div></p>

<p>Basically, I agree. The definition of what's exactly 'federal power' needs work, obviously.<br />

<div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div><span style="font-weight:bold">Duckluck: </span><br />
Since the OCA wasn't created from the top down, it makes no sense for it to be ruled from the top down. </div></p>

<p>To my way of thinking the OCA was created "top down" because it was formed by the heads of state of various countries, where they could advise and influence the quest within the parameters of Romhel's philosophy, but it would have been he and the Knights (at first) who probably chaired such meetings, arbitrated any problems, coordinated mass actions, and ensured that everything was being done Harmoniously in each nation. This is the model that Harmonium organisation would likely have been based on. The various heads of nations were eventually amalgamated into Provincial groups and then became the Council of Ortho.</p>

<p>I appreciate the fact that the Council of Ortho is formed from the Provincial representatives, but like I said, a Province isn't the same thing as a nation. With individual races, nations, alliances of state departments and faiths - and of course everyone being a loyal Harmonium member - I think there are enough divisions and power blocs among the representatives to make 'Provincial interest' only one of several possible motives for each member. </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div><span style="font-weight:bold">PDF, p25 </span>
[The Council of Ortho] is a representative council that passes laws and determines provincial governmental projects and budgets for the entire planet. </div></p>

<p>By the 'top' I'm talking the Council of Composers and the Council of Ortho, because this is really the only real government that the OCA has detailed at present. </p>

<p>As it stands at the moment the leaders of each nation within each Province deal with internal matters in the same (Harmoniously modified) way they always did, but all decisions that are beyond a single nation’s interests are decided outside of the local hierarchy, either Provincially, by the Composers, or by Council of Ortho. There’s nothing to stop the rulers of those nations being involved with the internal Provincial government process however, or even being in the Council of Ortho.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div><span style="font-weight:bold">Duckluck wrote</span>
The provinces who formed the government to advance their own interests would never allow the government to overwhelm them and pursue its own interests above theirs. </div></p>

<p>Provinces didn’t get together and decide to become the Pax Harmonium – the Knights of Harmony took their philosophy to one nation after another, and nations signed up or refused and resisted and were dealt with. The Knights – including the later members - were clearly the motivating force of the crusade, and individual nations were added to the Pax Harmonium whether they wanted to or not.  Local governments have been forced to accept the dictates of overlords and the needs of empires (and federations) since time immemorial - and more importantly to our circumstance, the needs of religious and philosophical movements as well.</p>

<p>Think of the situation as being analogous to early medieval Europe, where all nations were forced to accept the Roman Catholic faith, which included each king owing allegiance to one faith and to its supreme head (the Pope). While the Church frequently meddled in politics, its remit was primarily social and spiritual and the nobility’s job remained that of rulership.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div><span style="font-weight:bold">PDF, p209 </span>
[Romhel's] fellow Knights of Harmony battled various intractable monarchs in their plan of uniting the land </div></p>

<p>National governments were persuaded or forced to accept the Harmonium philosophy. Places that negotiated diplomatic solutions probably came out of it relatively unchanged, but ultimately nations didn't have a choice about joining up. The history of Ortho doesn't talk about many nations getting together to form a union, it talks about a crusade that consumes one nation after another (often by diplomacy). In the modern era of Ortho, things are probably more even, but that's just not how the Pax Harmonium was set up. That’s why they called it the “War of Harmony.”</p>

<p>Xaric, Iathra, Thaera, and Gelidahl are examples of the Harmonium basically setting up a government from scratch once the Province was pacified, so they certainly have the means to do it elsewhere if necessary - especially if they've found a claimant to the throne (or whatever position) who'll agree to their proposals, as quoted above (PDF, p181).</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div><span style="font-weight:bold">Duckluck wrote</span>
Julhien took away some of that control, but he couldn't change the fundamental structure of the government without alienating the few allies he had left. </div></p>

<p>Power clearly stemmed directly from the Octave in Julhien's time. Before the civil war individual Provinces didn't even have representation: </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div><span style="font-weight:bold">PDF, p182 </span>
The government of Ortho in Julhien's time consisted primarily of the Composer, who was head of the Harmonium; the Pontificator of the Lords of Law, the Pontificator of the Seven, and the Pontificator of the Nine, who together represented the official religions of Ortho; and representatives of the four quarters of the world. Together, these eight people made up the Octave Council. 
Each of the four Quarters ruled over a measure of Ortho's 17 provinces, the Composer controlled the military, and the Pontificators controlled the churches. </div></p>

<p>Julhien's civil war was caused by him trying to remove this power from the Octave and unify it under himself - as head of the Harmonium. The end result of the schism was that various powers were formally split among the Octave, to limit any single individual's power. Which is why I think that Octaves are heads of the Harmonium (of which military forces are only one aspect). </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div><span style="font-weight:bold">P183</span>
For the rebel provinces, this compromise solved none of the problems they had with the Harmonium military, but nobody asked them what they thought and they were too tired of fighting to continue </div></p>

<p>Although there's no mention of the Council of Ortho in the write-up at present, it's entirely possible that the Council of Ortho gained a lot more power at this point – the power to appoint Octaves, to ratify (or not) policies sent down from the Octave, and to divide budgets between Provinces - rather like the way the British Parliament works, with the Harmonium as the party in government and the Council of Ortho as the House of Commons it works through. </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div><span style="font-weight:bold">Duckluck wrote</span>
Basically, there's no top-down rule because there is no top to be ruling down from. The Harmonium has a lot of power, but its leaders (like all Octaves), are chosen by the Council of Ortho, and tend to do what the Council tells them to do. </div></p>

<p>I fail to see why being elected by/from the Council of Ortho would necessarily mean that appointees would be beholden and obedient to the Council. Part of the trouble here is that the Octave hasn't had anything defined about what it actually does, but based on what they are Composer’s of, I'd say that they’re probably the heads of the eight major departments of the Harmonium, with some additional legislative authority but their primary aim is to coordinate Harmonium efforts across the whole Pax Harmonium, while the Council of Ortho deals with matters as the representatives of the people of Ortho and apportions their resources between individual Provinces. </p>

<p>I <span style="font-style:italic">do </span>agree that the Harmonium’s eight departments are probably the primary tools of the government for getting things done, and that that ‘government’ is the Council or Ortho. As to the extent that one controls the other… I think that’s a matter between individual Councillors and Composers, political intrigues and alliances, and that probably swings back and forth over time.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div><span style="font-weight:bold">Duckluck wrote</span>
After all, if the provinces weren't assured of their control over the Octave, they would never have formed one in the first place. </div></p>

<p>They didn’t form the Octave and they were never assured power over it. The Octave was Romhel and the Knights, and a few key allies (specifically Varzak the Crushing Fist, Xiang Zhou, Queen Ealataeva of Alaens, and Gnar'ar'rikx the beholder), and that's the way it more or less continued until the Schism – see below (also see the quote on the Octave membership above):</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div><span style="font-weight:bold">PDF, p205</span>
The combination of the First Four and the Latter Four are the icons of the Octave Council and the basis for the form of that body. </div></p>

<p>Having them elected from the Council is a nice check and balance, but probably came in after the Schism, as part of the treaty and reconciliation (at least in its current form). It sounds like good practise (and great PR) to say that the highest eight ranks of the Harmonium are elected from representatives of the people, but given the Harmonium’s presence at every level of society, everyone on the Council will be an appropriately high-ranking Harmonium officer anyway, and by that rank should be committed to the cause above petty national interests.<br />
 <br />
This shouldn’t be a problem because <span style="font-style:italic">a)</span> they’re not representing individual nations, and <span style="font-style:italic">b) </span>the OCA seems entirely designed around examining, financing, and authorising - or not - the Harmonium’s various plans, projects, and initiatives. Nations deal with their own internal matters; the Council of Ortho authorises ‘federal aid’ budgets and sets down ‘federal law’, ‘national policy’, and ‘international diplomacy’ in roughly the same way relationship that the US government has with individual US states.</p>

<p>Regarding the specifics of how the Pax Harmonium treats individual Provinces and how much power they have, it's stated that all Provinces were once colonies. It’s also clear that they were allowed only limited self-rule before becoming full Provinces - and that this power can be revoked from them if they abuse it:</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div><span style="font-weight:bold">PDF, p35 </span>
"Province" is a category of colony. </div></p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div><span style="font-weight:bold">p34</span>
Colonies may be gained by any number of ways ranging from an agreement of allegiance to direct conquest </div></p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div><span style="font-weight:bold">P35 </span>
…When the first colonies were made of the Theran archipelago, this period was between ten and fifty years. However, there are several off-world colonies that can claim integration for over 50 years, but have not been granted province-hood due to arguments and repeated calls for examinations to prove that they have truly been harmonious in those years. </p>

<p>These are the colonies that are petitioning to be recognized as able to self-¬govern fully (to become an Integrated-Colony) and are often allowed to establish limited self-government, and even legislative bodies. </p>

<p>In practice organizing colonies are those that are still considered too chaotic to be allowed self-rule. </div></p>

<p>The intention seems to be that each Province is initially a colony, allowed limited self-rule, and that this is slowly expanded as they demonstrate their ability to live harmoniously. It doesn’t seem a great leap to assume that a similar arrangement brought native colonies (starting with Iathra and Thaera) into the Pax Harmonium; the Hardheads like to do things the same way for everyone, nice and fair and harmonious.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div><span style="font-weight:bold">PDF, p37 </span>
Each colony is expected to undergo the same progression into becoming a full member of Ortho's federal government. </div></p>

<p>Obviously places that submitted to the Harmonium via diplomacy might well be fast-tracked through the early part of this process, because I agree that the Harmonium wouldn't want to spend all its time occupying friendly territories when a few advisors and overseers can deal with it in conjunction with local authority - unless the places are in the situation quoted below: </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div><span style="font-weight:bold">PDF, p36 </span>
[Ward Colonies] have gained stability but for one reason or another have shown that they need more 'help' to become harmonized and are allowed very little - if any - powers of self-governance. </div></p>

<p>Either way however, the clear implication is that individual countries were forced (or agreed) to submit a portion of their power to the Harmonium, with a slow return of it as time goes on; a very different from the idea of a league of nations. Nations that behave themselves are ‘virtually autonomous’ – but that’s still a long way from true independence in practical terms. Because they ‘behave themselves’ they bow to the greater good embodied by Harmonium policies, and work within the system to oppose or modify anything they feel might not be to the greater good of their particular people. Their reward is that they can manage their own affairs, because they’ve proved they can do it harmoniously. Nations that refuse to play by the rules have their autonomy reduced or removed until they prove they can behave again.</p>

<p>There might well be a political movement, either current (Meter is probably fertile ground for supporters) or in the past (probably formed after the Schism) that wanted/wants to move to a system more like what Duckluck describes. That would be just one of many political alliances within the OCA (including hardliners who’d prefer a military dictatorship Julhien-style), but it’s not the system that was originally created, nor the system that’s in place at present.</p>

<p>This is my stance and my evidence and rationale for it, as clearly as I can express.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

          Ortho: Life In The Pax Harmonium        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>I'd like to start by pointing out that the PDF is rather confusingly written and <span style="font-style:italic">full</span> of ambiguous and contradictory information. It isn't even a rough draft at this point. In fact, part of the reason we are having this discussion is to clear out the ambiguity so we can know how these systems actually work. Also, you're confusing "Harmonium" and "OCA" again. According to the currently preferred definition, the Octaves of Planar and Prime Harmony are the only members of the Harmonium who are affiliated with the Harmonium (which, again, is mostly just the military). The other six Octaves head up departments within the OCA that <span style="font-style:italic">aren't</span> affiliated with the Harmonium in any meaningful way. </p>

<p>It has been stated that Keln'in, Iirondia, and Motmurk were each powerful nations that were individually probably the match for Romhel and his knights and, as such, were more allies of convenience than anything else. </p>

<p>Here's where I'm adding things, after the wars, these three nations were among the few that had not been decimated (in fact, they were more powerful than ever). The end of the war presented them with a perfect opportunity to extend their power over their neighbors, but the only problem was the Heka-Voll alliance and the Knights that served it. Rhomhel had started a planet-wide crusade, and open imperialism was bound to cause them to butt heads (with probably ruinous results for whoever was on the receiving end). So the three finally accepted Romhel's invitation to form a Federation and then used that as an excuse to push around all the nations around them. It was only later that they realized just how much power they had given up.</p>

<p>My interpretation is that in the early days, the Octave was the only central government, and each Octave member ruled over one department.  The Composer controlled the Harmonium (the military), the three religious Octaves controlled the various churches (and, originally, didn't have a lot of power), and the "four corners of the world" were totally dominated by the four major powers: the Heka-Voll alliance, Iirondia, Motmurck and Keln'in who each presided over a "Council of the Corner" as a way to hide their dominion over the weaker states. </p>

<p>Over time, the Harmonium and its Composer became more and more powerful, until one Composer, Julhien, decided to forgo the rest of the Octave entirely. When the conflict between the Church Octaves flared up, the Corners saw it as a chance to reassert their authority and unseat the Harmonium. Unfortunately for them, they had over-stepped their bounds and their subject states knew it. As the war flared up nations, groups and individuals became extremely powerful only to be pulled down again. When the endless war had finally blunted everyone's ambitions, the representatives of the four Corner Councils -- now united under the name "Council of Ortho" met and restarted the government. </p>

<p>The first thing the new Council did was dissolve the old government that had fared so poorly. They abolished Corner Councils and the old Octave Council and started a new Octave that they controlled. They humbled the Churches by taking away an Octave and thumbed their nose at Julhien by splitting the Harmonium into two departments controlled by two different Octave members. Then they replaced the now redundant Octaves of the Corners that had so incensed them previously with the four "Civil Octaves" they have now. They also took the opportunity write up a new constitution in which they made themselves the supreme law of the land with the power to appoint, replace, and veto the actions of the Octave.</p>

<p>This is adding a lot of information that was never stated in the PDF, but since the PDF is a work in progress and we're the ones writing it, there's not really anything wrong with that. What do you think?</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div><span style="font-weight:bold">Duckluck wrote:</span>
I'd like to start by pointing out that the PDF is rather confusingly written and full of ambiguous and contradictory information. It isn't even a rough draft at this point. In fact, part of the reason we are having this discussion is to clear out the ambiguity so we can know how these systems actually work. </div></p>

<p>Obviously the PDF is work in progress, and contains a lot of information that needs unifying (and downright contradictory stuff too) but it’s the only work produced for the project so far, and work by PS members. We should respect their contribution and try and work with what’s already been done, expanding and elaborating on it (which you’ve done nicely with some of the ideas above) rather than simply overwriting it in a new direction.</p>

<p>While there is conflicting information - some of which can be relatively easily tweaked into line, some of which can’t - I haven’t seen <span style="font-style:italic">anything </span>that contradicts the ‘conquest theory’ of the Pax Harmonium. My opinion isn’t something that I made up, only extrapolated on from the clear indications in all the Harmonium reference texts I cited, from the original Planescape campaign setting to the PSCS docs on Planewalker (which are certainly more than a rough draft) and the Ortho PDF (which certainly is).</p>

<p>That's not to say that the system that was set up is the same one as they have now - in fact, we know the contrary (and you elaborated on that too). </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Also, you're confusing "Harmonium" and "OCA" again. </div></p>

<p>I don’t think so, at least not in the general terms that I’m talking about. The Harmonium is generally likened to a Communist party and I’ve not found a better way ‘out of character’ to easily describe its general pervasiveness and reach: It dominates life on Ortho and being in "The Party” is considered essential for getting on in life; the Harmonium is a social philosophy and I’d say functions like a political party with a militant wing – a <span style="font-style:italic">very </span>large and influential wing, so much so that the whole organisation is organised along military lines – but I don’t think that’s the same as being in the Army. It certainly might not have been true at the start, but almost certainly is now.</p>

<p>It doesn’t seem too much of a stretch to say that all those Harmonium advisors and administrators eventually became part of a second force, a bureaucracy part of the same service but independent of the military; a ‘parchment army’ that’s organised similarly to the army but functions <span style="font-style:italic">under </span>the government (but not part of the ruling elite). I don’t know the US equivalent but the UK bureaucracy works roughly like this; separate from but answering to those in power. Not sure if I’ve clearly defined that before. It actually splits Harmonium power up, I think, because each part of the bureaucracy would answer to a local official: They’d have a central mandate and some powers relating to their role, but the person in charge would be a local ruler, not one of them.</p>

<p>I think that is good from a meta-game point of view as well: If the Heardheads are only the army then it will be practically impossible to play PCs that are active members of the Harmonium unless the DM is running a military-based campaign. This way characters can come from a variety of backgrounds and professions and still enjoy enough freedom for adventures, much like PC Harmonium in Planescape. It keeps the Harmonium militaristic but doesn’t limit the scope to purely military personnel. There can be Harmonium lawyers, teachers, bureaucrats, diplomats, etc. And I don’t think it will significantly alter the balance of power if we work the details out right. </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>According to the currently preferred definition, the Octaves of Planar and Prime Harmony are the only members of the Harmonium who are affiliated with the Harmonium (which, again, is mostly just the military). The other six Octaves head up departments within the OCA that aren't affiliated with the Harmonium in any meaningful way. </div></p>

<p>I can’t really answer this question except by repeating what I said above, so I’ll put it on hold until the question of scope of the Harmonium is dealt with (in essence though, if you replaced the word ‘Harmonium’ above with ‘military’, I’d have no problem with it). But where specifically is it the currently preferred definition? I’ll be easier to convince if you can quote passages and other people. There’s a LOT of threads to get through these days, and I mighty genuinely have missed something. </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>It has been stated that Keln'in, Iirondia, and Motmurk were each powerful nations that were individually probably the match for Romhel and his knights and, as such, were more allies of convenience than anything else. </div></p>

<p>What statements do we have that you feel back that up? I’m not denying the amount of military might, but I’m not convinced on the “more allies of convenience” part… Your arguments below are good, but I think they probably found more common ground than just politics. I find paladin Romhel’s alliance with devil-worshipping orcs and tyrannical beholders hard enough to swallow as it is - I think he’ll have had to come to <span style="font-style:italic">some </span>kind of personal understanding with his allies (“order above all” probably being the common ground, and maybe some articles of war).</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Here's where I'm adding things, after the wars, these three nations were among the few that had not been decimated (in fact, they were more powerful than ever). The end of the war presented them with a perfect opportunity to extend their power over their neighbours, but the only problem was the Heka-Voll alliance and the Knights that served it. Rhomhel had started a planet-wide crusade, and open imperialism was bound to cause them to butt heads (with probably ruinous results for whoever was on the receiving end). So the three finally accepted Romhel's invitation to form a Federation and then used that as an excuse to push around all the nations around them. It was only later that they realized just how much power they had given up. </div></p>

<p>I don’t think that I have any problems with this statement, or that it’s mutually exclusive with what I’ve said. Almost certainly the devil’s in the details but I think that it’s distinctly possible the members thought they were going into a federation/religious alliance… then woke up one morning and discovered they lacked more power than they thought.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>My interpretation is that in the early days, the Octave was the only central government, and each Octave member ruled over one department. The Composer controlled the Harmonium (the military), the three religious Octaves controlled the various churches (and, originally, didn't have a lot of power), and the "four corners of the world" were totally dominated by the four major powers: the Heka-Voll alliance, Iirondia, Motmurck and Keln'in who each presided over a "Council of the Corner" as a way to hide their dominion over the weaker states. </div></p>

<p>“Council of the Corner” is a neat phrase btw. We should keep it – possibly for whatever the inter-Province version of the Council of Ortho is? (whatever its form and function).</p>

<p>I think your reasons above are how the Knights were able to establish their power. Major allies like Motmurk were allowed imperial ambitions: Effectively they each ruled a whole quarter of the empire (n<span style="font-style:italic">ot a bad result</span>) as long as they towed the line on Harmony and called their rule “the Orthorian Central Authority” not “The Empire of Motmurk.”</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Over time, the Harmonium and its Composer became more and more powerful, until one Composer, Julhien, decided to forgo the rest of the Octave entirely. When the conflict between the Church Octaves flared up, the Corners saw it as a chance to reassert their authority and unseat the Harmonium. </div></p>

<p>You know, as time goes on I think that the Schism is less and less the <span style="font-style:italic">real </span>cause of the civil war… just the point that featured heaviest in propaganda by the ‘winners’ and which is generally cited as the cause these days (I don’t think the regime would want “several personal grabs for power and independence” in its history books). Religion was a cause certainly, but maybe more the spark that ignited the powder than anything else?</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Unfortunately for them, they had over-stepped their bounds and their subject states knew it. As the war flared up nations, groups and individuals became extremely powerful only to be pulled down again. When the endless war had finally blunted everyone's ambitions, the representatives of the four Corner Councils -- now united under the name "Council of Ortho" met and restarted the government. </span></p>

<p>I like the way you describe the war – the tumultuous rise and fall of statesmen in bloody and contested times, when a bold commander might rise to dominance only to be undone by treachery or rivals. It sounds like a very interesting period to play in. </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>The first thing the new Council did was dissolve the old government that had fared so poorly. They abolished Corner Councils and the old Octave Council and started a new Octave that they controlled. They humbled the Churches by taking away an Octave and thumbed their nose at Julhien by splitting the Harmonium into two departments controlled by two different Octave members. Then they replaced the now redundant Octaves of the Corners that had so incensed them previously with the four "Civil Octaves" they have now. They also took the opportunity write up a new constitution in which they made themselves the supreme law of the land with the power to appoint, replace, and veto the actions of the Octave. </div></p>

<p>I’d prefer an end to the civil war that feels more like an exhausted stalemate and compromise (as it’s written up at present), but that’s more feel than specifics. I know it’s only a work in progress, but tallying the PDF (p183) and your work:</p>

<p>1) Both the Seven and the Nine lost out, so that fits with them being humbled. </p>

<p>2) Julhien’s power certainly got split up, stopping the immediate threat.</p>

<p>3) Provinces got individual representatives – the big win for the rebels and the point where the old <span style="font-style:italic">Alliance of Harmony</span> lost out on their imperial dreams.</p>

<p>So the theory’s sound, the work’s good, and it adds to existing work by other contributors – the best way to go about things, basically. </p>

<p>Arguments over specifics… I think will  bring us back to our two core disagreements, but I’ll try to add something new rather than just rehashing what we’ve all heard before:</p>

<p>Accepting for a moment the premise of a Harmonium that has civil/bureaucratic aspect as well as a military one (although maybe it didn’t until this point in history?), why not divide Julhien’s power up eight ways rather than two? The Composer (now Composer<span style="font-style:italic">s</span>) get to keep executive power over the Harmonium’s activities and to set the direction of “international policies” but the responsibilities are split between eight people. That’s not too bad a compromise for Julhien; to the eyes of his “Harmonium in charge of everything” power bloc, the hardheads are still at the technical ‘top’ of government.</p>

<p>The rebels however, have just abolished the Four Corners, so perhaps the Provinces could have instigated the Council of Ortho in its modern form at this time? It receives direction from the Composers on Harmonium policies, but has discretion to prioritise them and show different levels of support, to see that any policy is integrated ‘properly’ (i.e. in accordance with their concerns) and while not strictly a ‘veto’ it can also endlessly send decisions back to the Octave for review if enough of the Council thinks it’s a bad idea (that’s in the PDF at present). Sure the Octave has its own powers to force the issue as well, but it comes down to politics between individuals and cabals - good for more political gaming.</p>

<p>Individual Composers would have control of their overall departments - Agricultural, Urban, Legal, etc – but within each local area most Harmonium personnel end up answering to some kind of local ruler, as I described above. As a compromise however, some power remains exclusively within the Harmonium – basically the right to ‘police’ the OCA and a system to hold individual nations and Provinces accountable if they violate the Pax Harmonium (although not to run roughshod over them). </p>

<p>Hopefully this shouldn’t happen much anyway, because most people are already in the system to some extent. OCA members and Composers could (and should) be Harmonium ‘party members’ with some rough correlation between their government rank and their Harmonium rank – at least as far as saying that by the time your elected to the Council of Ortho you should be more than Notary One...</p>

<p>The "supreme power" bit you know I have issue with already: Its not the 'Pax Harmonium' if the Harmonium aren't in control of it. However... if you accept the above point about a wider Harmonium and its rank and OCA rank being roughly equal, then "the Harmonium" (as a whole) is still in charge (I'm not arguing for a military dictatorship). The Council of Ortho and the Composers are the top Harmonium officials <span style="font-style:italic">as well as</span> the top national officials of each Province. They should be harmonious enough to not be only interested in their own Province (at least in theory, at least most of the time)</p>

<p>In conclusion, at the moment it seems like the more specific we get, the closer we come to something workable. There’s lots of constructive good stuff here (hopefully from me too), so after getting your feedback on mine, I’d suggest the best strategy at present is to make a list of powers: Exactly what authority would people specifically like to see in the hands of individual nations and Provinces, and what specifically in the hands of the Harmonium? And I suppose any other powers that any other groups should hold too.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Clearly what we have here is a problem of terminology. We're basically saying the same thing at this point (or at least something similar) except that you are treating the Harmonium as a political party/ruling elite and I'm treating it as a government controlled organization (the military). What I meant to say in my above post was that the composers of Prime and Planar Harmony were the only two members of the <span style="font-style:italic">Octave</span> that were also in the Harmonium. This is basically the idea myself and a few others (who I'll allow to speak for themselves) have settled on.  But the older notion that that the Harmonium was in control of all the government (like a Communist party) is the one that appears most often in the PDF. </p>

<p>In regards to the Pax Harmonium, the term is, I believe, Latin for "Harmonious Peace" or something similar, and I see no reason why the Harmonium (who, remember, are sometimes called the "Harmonium Guard"), couldn't be so named because they're <span style="font-style:italic">guarding</span> Harmony. In effect, they would be named after the Pax Harmonium, rather than the other way around. The fact that their names are similar enough to cause that confusion though is in all likelihood a clever scheme by long dead Harmonium propagandists.</p>

<p>Anyway, we clearly need a Glossary of terms to work this mess out, which I think will be my next project (and then I'll get back to the half-dozen other projects here that I've left in limbo).</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>To give a little bit of context to the PDF version of the Ortho government - it is arguably the *weakest* of the sections in the PDF simply because it's still in it's cut and paste from the thread form combined with some very random chatter and thoughts I had at the time of copy and pasting. It is in *NO* way coherent and I just hadn't gotten to making it coherent like I had with other sections when I reached a pause point on it.</p>

<p>I'm thinking it might be worthwhile for me to sit down this weekend to try and get it pulled together using this thread as feedback and get us to something at least sensical within itself for the next round of debate. After all, I'm essentially the one with executive power to decide - and I've got no problems using that to get us progressed to some sounder footing for the next round of debate... (aka how thing are is still being determined, don't worry about that - I'm just giving us something to work with as a prototype) That should make things easier. <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/wink.png" title="Eye-wink" alt="Eye-wink" class="smiley-content"/></p>

<p>The notes on communism popped up in the previous thread because it is *such* an obvious comparison that it had to be addressed. The problem of course being that while obvious it is not necessarily accurate... particularly in light of the signifigant difference between Russian flavored communism and Chinese flavored - something that can be hard to bend the bonebox around. In this case the point in the thread at the time was to highlight that the military still answers to the rule of law, not the other way around... once this was highlighted int he previous thread cleaning up the left over terminology from the PDF fell by the wayside (see above) which would be mea culpa. </p>

<p>It is important to note that the Harmonium-as Orthos military organization - has its roots in a military organization of Knights not in a political party. That it has spread considerably into some very non-military roles is an oddity - but something I think we can adjust to. After all, we have the Army Corp of Engineers as an example in the US. For an example of how things could work - or at least something to help us understand the difference between military and political party: the US Navy is not a branch of the Republican party even though their highest leader currently is. In a similar fashion we probably need to mentally separate the military entity from the philosophical as we discuss things. </p>

<p>It is even entirely possible that there are shades of harmonic thinking within Ortho - all very much believing in the nature and truth of Harmony, but debating politely/legally/and hamoniusly in order to find something all can agree on. The existence of the Schools of Ethics certainly imply that there is still on going debate, no doubt in regards to means and methods of achieving harmony, the 'moral' obligation of Ortho's people, etc etc.</p>

<p>The hardest part of this is losing the mental standpoint of a planar as we go into this - as planar influenced as we the writers are... we're having to *totally* revise our view of what we're addressing. In Sigil - they are a political party - but this is an oddity for them, a role adopted to make it easier to influence and eventually dominate the City of Doors. And coming from a planar point of view we've fallen for it hook line and sinker. (See the note on colonization techniques in the PDF - I *think* I pasted that in.) It's worthwhile to consider that the face of the Harmonium that we see in the planes, in Sigil, and the planar colonies may be subject to varying levels of spin given the mission statement of actions abroad.</p>

<p>Hm. You know. For sanity sake... </p>

<p>How about, let's call the military the *military* and the legislation the *legislation*... ? That seems the simplest way to be clear which branch/department/segment/authority/role/philosophy we mean until we can get in the habit of knowing which title goes where? I can afterwards just do a search and replace through the PDF to pick out the right titles later. <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/wink.png" title="Eye-wink" alt="Eye-wink" class="smiley-content"/></p>

<p>Re: The Schism - you're probably right. Much like how the Civil War was not *just* about slavery... I doubt the Schism was *just* about religion...</p>

<p>BTW: Anyone have any ideas on how to de-Greekify that one province?</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>First of all, I want to point you guys to the nifty <a href="forum_.html" class="bb-url">Glossary</a> I just started. If we want to debate the meaning of "Harmonium" further, I'd suggest moving it over there.</p>

<p>In regards to de-Greekifying Omospondia, there a couple ways we could do it. The easiest way would be to change all the names so they aren't Greek. This will keep people from immediately recognizing what culture it's based on and also make us look like we're being much more original than we actually are. For instance, we could replace all the names with ones in Nahuatl (the Aztec language) and watch as people get really confused over just what culture this is a fantasy counterpart for. </p>

<p>Or we can keep the names and terminology but add aspects to their culture that are blatantly un-Greek, such as disdain for merchants and the sea, a nomadic life-style, or something even weirder like cannibalism. This would be harder to do, but arguably more rewarding. It's always nice to subvert audience expectations, after all.</p>

<p>What we shouldn't do is replace one unimaginative fantasy counterpart culture with another. For instance if we replaced the Greek with Nahuatl and replaced their mercantile city-states with an empire of tributary nations controlled by one central group hungry for slaves to sacrifice, what would we have really gained?</p>

<p>But so long as we don't replace I-can't-believe-they're-not-Greeks with I-can't-believe-they're-not-Aztecs, I think we should be free to mix and match whatever bits of culture we want, provided they don't clash too badly with one another. The Province will almost certainly be better off with a bit of imagination.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Agreed... hm. As long as I'm looking over the politics this weekend I'll see if I can look over that as well. As I recall I had a devil of a time making sure the histories of the interrelated provinces there meshed without looking like an Utter mess - and I think the Sea Peoples got the short end of the development stick as a result... but since we're revising - that gives us a chance to make the small changes needed to make it all hang together well.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Having a quick glance over the Osmopondia writeup and the names are the crux of the problem. Many of the Greek cultural facets are broad (or undescribed) enough to apply to any race, and <span style="font-style:italic">some </span>of the names are fine - but there are too many obviously greek names - all the 'Polises, the 'Drakos' sea, recognising Iphika as Ithaca, Iskandros as Alexander etc.</p>

<p>Maybe a few name changes and some extra cultural info? Just hide the source material a little better.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">*edit*</span></p>

<p>Regarding the main point however, so what are the "big questions" we should tackle asap? The first ideas into my head are:</p>

<p>1) Scope of the Harmonium (the whole military/party issue - but essentially, "what should they do other than fight?")</p>

<p>2) What do Composers actually <span style="font-style:italic">do?</span> </p>

<p>3) What powers do the various government bodies have? What bodies does the OCA have other than the Council of Ortho and the Octave?</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I'll give you the answers I've settled on. Any of you are free to dispute these, however.</p>

<p>1) As long as we're assuming that the Harmonium is just another arm of the government, I'd suggest limiting their power mainly to things real-world militaries do. But if any real world military has done it, It's probably fair game. Running Colonial governments? Sure. Managing building and engineering projects? Of course. Policing troubled areas? why not? Distributing propaganda? Naturally. Just as long as you don't go overboard and give them every power under the sun, it will work pretty well.</p>

<p>2) I'm assuming you mean members of the Octave here (see the Glossary for why Composer is a tricky word to use). I'd suggest having the Octave's main role be as an executive branch that oversees the vastness of government bureaucracy (like cabinet secretaries in the US or ministers in the UK). They also have the power to veto legislation or enact laws of their own on 7-1 vote (the 7-1 part is straight from the PDF), but the Council of Ortho can overturn these votes if they get a two-thirds vote (that part's all mine, but it makes sense now that we've established the Council as the central governmental body). The Octave pretty much have free reign over their departments but if any of them are doing a <span style="font-style:italic">really</span> bad job, the Council of Ortho can remove them and appoint a new one (again with a two thirds vote), but this is an exceedingly rare occurrence and most Octave members serve for life or until they retire (for dwarfs and Beholders, this can mean ruling for centuries). The Octave also serves a judicial function, but since the lines between judge and legislature are a bit blurred, this works exactly the way the legislation does (7-1 vote, Council can overrule with 2/3). The Octaves generally prefer to leave the court decisions to the Council, however.</p>

<p>3) In addition to the two Councils, I see each Octave as overseeing his or her own branch of the governmental bureaucracy. So, Xiu controls the Prime Harmonium, Tzuro controls the Department of Agriculture, Brownbrow directs the Department of Legal and Ethical Affairs, and so on. The finished PDF should probably devote at least a paragraph or two to each of the 8 departments.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

          Ortho: Life In The Pax Harmonium        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Hey, I'm late here, so I'll add my own comments to the idea.  I felt the need to especially add my two cents because this thread inspired a great deal of Heka-Voll's government structure.  Which is, especially, the ironic fact that the Harmonium's first nation is one of the most genuinely contrary ones to the ideals of the Harmonium as presented.</p>

<p>For this write-up, I think it should go in largely "as is" but I believe that someone should add a disclaimer that cultural attitudes tend to effect this same basic universal system.  Also that certain regions, when noted, don't follow this model because of cultural attitudes.  It still reflects more than half the populous of Ortho's lifestyles.</p>

<p>I also think that you both have reached an amicable settlement but I'd like to throw in my two cents.  I think that the fundamental argument of whether the Provinces are independent entities or subordinate to the Ortho Council is probably an ongoing one within the setting itself.  We're sort of at the Pre-Civil War stage of the United States.</p>

<p>At present, some governments feel that the Council of Ortho should reflect their representative interests while leaving them alone while the Federal Government of Harmony's Glory wants to see all of the countries of the OCA to be "standardized" with some support from certain states within as well.  This is especially true with the colonies that had their own worldviews well before the Harmonium arrived.</p>

<p>But yes, I view the Octave as essentially each dictators in their own sphere.  They have to rely on others and bargain between them in order to get their various matters done.  At present, I'm sure they'll eventually elect a new Composer (President) to actually lead them.</p>

<p>Great write up, though.</p>

<p>My own take is that the Harmonium is a massive bureaucracy that has a limited amounts of funds to divert everywhere and that's what often leads to a lot of problems within the state.  They're always looking for corners to cut and farming amongst other areas is one of those places.  They're still providing roads, food, and state-supplemented housing for all citizenry.  It's not a BAD system, it's just a hard to sustain one.</p>

<p>I'd personally describe the living conditions for Provender provided folk living in Poor Housing provided for by the Harmonium.  Basically, the Harmonium version of the Projects.  I'd imply they vary by region and quality as well.  </p>

<p>Frankly, I'd also like to tone down some of the issues of "All Citizens created equal" and allow the Harmonium to keep noble titles for ceremonial and historical purposes, which better fits Ortho as envisioned I think.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">
