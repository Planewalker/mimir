</div> <p>Well, I've been throwing this around lately, and I'll see how far it goes. I'll post it here for now since this seems the best place and the actual articles are in flux.</p>

<p>Fair Warning: the following story is set post-Faction War and post-Incursion, make of this what you will.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Scales of Reaction</span></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Prologue: Watching the Watcher</span></p>

<p>	Deep in the vastness of the Outlands, called Concordant Opposition by those who praise complex labels above useful ones, a great dragon sits atop a pile of shattered glass and watches the sand trickle through innumerable hourglasses. This is the Mausoleum of Chronepsis, named for the great dragon who resides there, and not only a dragon, but a deity of his kind, god of fate, of death, and of inevitable judgment. His task, given to him by his elder brother Io, creator of all dragons and some claim all things, is to watch over the lives of all the dragons in the vast multiverse, and to ward against those who meddle with the free and proper fates of these lives.</p>

<p>	In this moment, called the present by most, and the Tenth Year since the War of the Factions by those who reckon such things for history, Chronepsis is not alone. This is not itself unusual, the lord of draconic death has not closed his realm from visitors, and though there is little purpose in traveling the cold halls of the Mausoleum, the vast planes have a seemingly endless supply of those with more curiosity than sense. However, the visitor before the massive colorless wyrm of the dead of this day was no wandering planewalker.</p>

<p>	She, for though she is no simple mortal creature her femininity is unassailably part of her, is a creature formed of strange droplets, watery and whispering with sorrow, tall and slender in gray robes. Blue eyes stare down at the dragon god from where she floats above the floor to meet his gaze in a face otherwise devoid of any feature. Visions of strange and exotic places, creatures, and mysteries spill from her form as the rain falls from the sky, a torrent of the whitewater of unfiltered knowledge. This stream of data can scourge the minds of mortals, but Chronepsis swims in it effortlessly, absorbing all released before him, taking it as a form of tribute, though it is simply a by-product of his visitor’s nature.</p>

<p>	The name of this visitor is Illurien of the Myriad Glimpses, though none save she knows is this is truly her name or simply a label fashioned to represent her. Chronepsis does not know, but the dragon god does not care, for it is not his business. Illurien is a collector of knowledge, and the Death Dragon knows she comes here to collect such. He tells her nothing himself, for the deity is mute, unable to communicate even in the mindspeach of telepathic magic or psionic probes, but she learns much all the same. To one with such knowledge as Illurien possesses the shifting patterns of the hourglasses, differences in size, abundance, and placement tell much. The dragon of fate allows her this, for she can learn nothing she is not meant to know, and if she we to try he would drive her from his presence and bar her from his realm forever.</p>

<p>	Illurien does not press the forbearance of her host, and she respects his silence, saying nothing to disturb the mighty wyrm’s contemplation. She studies instead the many hourglasses, watching the sand run down as it measures out the lives of dragons, dragonkin, and all members of other races who follow the draconic pantheon. The hourglasses of these last are usually much smaller than those of the true dragon species, but tellingly this is not always so. Power and destiny weave a delicate waltz through the hall of the god of fate. The watery seeker admires all of this; it appeals to her alien ascetic sense. Had she a mouth she might smile at the colorless scaled deity before her.</p>

<p>	There is a silent thrum of power and something shifts within the cavern. Chronepsis’ head does not move, for he knows all in this place inherently, but the gaze of Illurien shifts, and discovers a pocket of hourglasses of unusual design, strange and ancient, unlike any she has seen here before. Floating closer on the propulsion of her intricate will she notices another oddity.</p>

<p>	The sand in these hourglasses does not move.</p>

<p>	Well does Illurien know the flow of sand marks the progression of each dragon’s life. That it should be held in place is not itself unusual. Throughout the Mausoleum many of the timepieces are in such a state, for there are many ways to stand beyond time. Residence upon the astral plane, magical spells of stasis, a dark clouding representing assumption of undead status, and other mysterious fates, but the grouping intrigues Illurien. Her hunger for knowledge is the core of her being, insatiable and immortal of its own. The wish to learn the heart of this matter multiplies from trickle to torrent within her at great speed.</p>

<p>	She resolves to weld her considerable power to learning this hidden truth of dragonkind.</p>

<p>	A great clawed hand, coated with colorless scales the size of man, and topped with talons to sharp enough to rend the lives of the immortal, sweeps through the air between Illurien and this unsolved puzzle.</p>

<p>	Blue eyes turn to gaze into the featureless unblinking orbs of the Death Dragon. Without words she understands the prohibition that has been placed upon her. For a tiny moment the water construction that is her body shivers, and Illurien knows fear, for the gods of death are among the few beings in the multiverse who possess the power to unmake her existence, the only secret of her own nature Illurien does not possess. </p>

<p>	Though it boils at her, she bows in respect, and takes her leave, returning through mystic warping to her own home elsewhere in the Outlands, the Athenaeum Nefarious. Once there she takes some small solace. Though she has been bared by divine hands not to investigate the fate of those frozen dragon lives, one day those fates will be decided, for no hourglasses remains stopped in the Mausoleum forever. Eventually the sand will trickle down, the fate determined, and then she will be free to know the truth. </p>

<p>	Despite this consolation, Illurien cannot completely evade a brief stab of speculative envy for whatever mortals whose fate it is to solve this puzzle. </p>

<p>	It is an opinion those particular beings, lacking Illurien’s almost complete indestructibility, would be unlikely to share; had they the misfortune to know what fate awaited them.</p>

(this is the part where I write explanations about some of the stuff in each chapter, in the event it may be of interest to readers)</p>

<p>1.	Illurien of the Myriad Glimpses appears in Monster Manual V (for practical purposes the 3.5e rules are the backdrop of this story), and she’s included here because, well, why not.</p>

<p>2.	Various portions of the description of Chronepsis are drawn from numerous sources, as facts about him have appeared in scattered snippets here and there for years.</p>       </div>

         <p>And now to get into the meat of the thing.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Chapter 1: Warring among Warmongers</span><br />
	<br />
	Loud the peal of alarm rang out, carried by the magnification of magical wards, terrible and shrill. <span style="font-style:italic">An attack!</span> The thought rang through the mind of Shakvail as she jolted from meditation and ran to the rack on the side of her tiny room, grabbing for her armor and weapons. <span style="font-style:italic">Who would attack the order hall?</span> It was a horrible premonition in the back of her mind.</p>

<p>	Then the alarm’s tenor changed, becoming deeper and raw, marking the nature of the enemy as the watching wizard, one of their very few, attempted to inform and rally the defenders.</p>

<p>	To Shakvail, recognizing that shift, it was a bellow of despair, the confirmation of her greatest fears. The Hall of the Disciplined Blades, headquarters of one of the many sub-sects of the Crusaders of Gith, was under attack by their own kind.<br />
 <br />
	It was only to be expected. Vlaakith, may her name be cursed forever, was gone for all time, and the Lich-Queen in her madness had left no provision for the lives of the multitudinous Githyanki without her. For a people who lived, rightly Shakvail still believed most days, by the blade, this was a recipe for untold chaos. Some Githyanki might welcome such destruction as their personal chance, but for the enlightened soldiers of the crusaders it was a herald of many defeats at the hands of their numerous and powerful enemies. </p>

<p>	Shakvail pulled her long war scythe from the wall, caressing the dark wood of the haft and her grim face positively despondent as she contemplated sinking the sharp blade into the bodies of her fellows. She recalled the days when she had first joined the order, seeking out the discipline and patterned instruction in an effort to escape the backbiting that had always disappointed her. Now it had followed her even into this sanctuary.</p>

<p>	Then she was running through stone halls, moving far faster than any human in a prime material castle, bouncing from wall to wall with controlled recklessness. In the absent gravity of the Astral Plane and with the lifelong practice of the Githyanki, its adopted rulers, the only limit on speed was the danger of inducing injury by colliding with a wall too quickly during a turn or slamming into another runner as the halls suddenly became crowded with warriors.</p>

<p>	A Githyanki army is a bright, shiny thing, filled by men and women with red hair, shining metal armor encrusted with gems, gold, and silver, and carrying as many adornments as they dared, all designed to impress. The Disciplined Blades, rushing out to defend the walls and entrances of their order hall, were not like this. No gemstones covered their armor, no gold filigree danced upon the shafts of their war scythes, longspears, and naginatas. They did not follow such decorative methods. They were still, however, Githyanki, and their armor was adorned with intricate needlework designs, leather brands of astonishing complexity, tattoos of incomparable artistry could be seen on many exposed muscles, and the weapons had fine exotic woods, shimmering metal weaves, and other adornment.</p>

<p>	Five warriors dashed ahead on the wings of their wills before the entrance Shakvail had chosen, on the ‘bottom’ side of their fortress. In the absence of gravity all directions were arbitrary, but the fortress had a designed layout and clear internal organization for greater efficiency. As they reached the entrance to the surface of the craggy piece of granite upon which the order hall had been built, the outermost ring of defenses, the first of these warriors collapsed suddenly.</p>

<p>	Paying him no mind the others dashed past, Shakvail noted idly that a pair of bolts had penetrated his armor; the deadly work of a triple-shot crossbow, a weapon unique to the Githyanki. </p>

<p>	Then they were into the ring of surface defenses, and the battle raged through the shimmering emptiness of the Astral Plane all around. </p>

<p>	A trio of astral cruisers, the psychic-powered ships of the Githyanki, stood in a vertical line to one face of the rock, their powerful ballistae and magical weapons bombarding the defenses. Defensive ballistae answered them, but few of the great bolts reached the ships, most were intercepted by jagged bolts of silver-white lightning, the work of enemy wizards. </p>

<p>	<span style="font-style:italic">Damn you warlocks!</span> Shakvail cursed the ambition of all who wielded arcane might. It was they who had been among the first to assert themselves as the new rulers of the Githyanki after Vlaakith fell. Knowing it was these who attacked them; the defender knew why they had come. <span style="font-style:italic">They fear us,</span> she hissed silently, running among stony pyramids to a choke point. </p>

<p>	The Disciplined Blades were not simple swordsmen; they pursued not the technical, brutish master of the blade of most Githyanki warriors, but a mental martial cause, the enlightened and clear-minded warriors in the legacy of Gith and the others who had rebelled against the most-hated Illithid in the long forgotten times. While it had been the power of the mind itself, the living expression of mystic will known as psionics that had one that war, for those Githyanki who lacked such powers there were more martial pursuits of the same legacy. Such was Shakvail, what humans called a Sohei, a warrior who fought with internal energy and esoteric mastery of the body. </p>

<p>	Githyanki soldiers issued forth from the cruisers, blasting across the short distance with blurring speed, moving as fast as they might to avoid defensive missiles, pulling up only to level their swords and charge the last few steps. Arrows and crossbow bolts flew from both sides, and the sohei countercharged to meet the attackers at those points that must be crossed to achieve entry within.</p>

<p>	 A tall male materialized before Shakvail, lunging forward with an overhand thrust to cut her from shoulder to hip with his greatsword.</p>

<p>	She shifted, already sliding in anticipation, flipping her body in three dimensions, letting her scythe trail, almost casual but held with an iron grip, pulling it behind like a hoe to slice his leg through and then on to rip the back muscles and shred bone. Her feet pressed down on a stony block as blood sprayed the air and she rolled downward, dodging bolts through the empty expanse.</p>

<p>	The battle narrowed around her, as the struggle to survive overwhelmed all. She crossed blades with many in the press, some blurred beyond any easy grasp of the mind as friend and foe alike invoked the potent powers of their race. Bright flashes of light exploded around the fighters, blades struck and sparked, and blood sprayed everywhere. No gravity pulled it to the ground, so it floated between the combatants and the bodies of the fallen, drenching their flesh and armor when they were forced to step through it. Soon every combatant was covered in a second skin of red gore and only the differences of their weapons made it possible to know friend from foe.</p>

<p>	“Ki!” screams of righteous rage tore the airless backdrop of the Astral as many of the sohei unleashed the martial frenzy that was one of the mighty secrets of their path. In this state many fought on with mortal wounds, entrails streaming free, hearts pierced by bolts, one spear even struck through the chest of an invader in the moment its wielder’s head slipped free of his shoulders.</p>

<p>	Shakvail did not yet draw on this frenzy, worried she would be caught up in the battle rush and not able to react to the needs of the defense. She took a bloody gash on the left arm, and was almost speared through the thigh, but the magical leather scales turned the blade. They were a rough brassy shade, the color of the dragon from whose flesh it had been fashion, a gift from her father for earning her blade. They saved her life many times in that hellish melee, along with the other mystical adornments earned on campaigns against the slaves of the Illithids or the allies of the despise Githzerai, a belt augmenting her strength, gloves to heighten her reflexes, a jeweled necklace opening greater understanding, and a ring offering mystical protection to make every blow seeking her life a little less likely to land. </p>

<p>	Blinking flee of a cloud of blood as she flipped over one corpse to engage another female, a woman wielding a long chain, Shakvail caught a glimpse of brightness streaking from above at the edge of her vision. Instinctively she double stepped back, struggling to keep her scythe between the edges of the chains and her flesh.</p>

<p>	Then there was a great boom and a wash of heat rippled through the combatants. Fireball! Shakvail ducked, far too late, only to find she was complete uninjured. </p>

<p>	Weakling, she smiled grimly, and saw hideous burns on the face of the woman in front of her. Taking advantage of the momentary helplessness induced by the pain she gutted this enemy with a single sure stroke, cutting up between the armor plates. Silently she thanked her luck the wizard who had launched the spell was only of middling power, and the resistance born to her kind, augmented by her training and internal strength, had managed to block the spell’s power. </p>

<p>	The indiscriminate fireball had cleansed the outcrop, and responding to the shouted signal of some officer the remaining invaders fell back. Shakvail sought out the senior of her fellows, finding him standing beside two close friends. There were only eight of the Disciplined Blades left here now, but they were more than the enemies who had fled, and Shakvail found herself joining a ragged cheer as the foe fell back.</p>

<p>	It lasted only a moment, for her senior waved a hand mandating quiet. “Stand ready,” he spoke darkly, words filled with the heat of battle, but also a deeper suspicion beneath the surface anger. “Something’s not right. They’ve not brought enough numbers.”</p>

<p>	Looking out Shakvail saw it was true. At a guess she suspected the enemy had little more than their own numbers in this section, and no doubt it was the same elsewhere. They had an advantage in magic, possessing more wizards and warlocks to lead the battle, but this was matched by the sohei’s ability to fight with mortal injuries and their other special techniques, including the enlightened spells known to some of the monks. Shakvail had a few such tricks, and intended to call upon one before the next attack.</p>

<p>	In light of this the attack did not much make sense. Even if the enemy won their losses would surely outweigh any gains made, and they must know the sohei would fight to the death.</p>

<p>	“This first attack was just to soften us up,” her senior guessed. “They must have some trick they’re going to use next, be ready.”</p>

<p>	As if prophesied by those words a massive voice rang out, the magically enhanced outcry of the enemy commander. “Warriors!” he insulted them by refusing them their proper title. “This is your one chance to surrender! Only death awaits if you continue to resist!”</p>

<p>	Many voices shouted as one in refusal, Shakvail’s among them, accompanied by vicious insults, for these were Githyanki at war.</p>

<p>	“So be it!” the wizard’s anger was palpable even as he hid behind the hull of his great ship. “My allies and I will insure your deaths shall be slow and painful!”</p>

<p>	The sides of the cruisers opened and more Githyanki issued forth, but they were not alone. A massive, winged creature head and shoulders taller than even the tallest Githyanki and many times bulkier flew forth with a huge axe between clawed hands. It had green skin and a great horned, dog-faced head.</p>

<p>	“Daemon!” Shakvail’s senior breathed in fear, marking the beast as one of the fiends of Gehenna, mercenary beings also known as Yugoloths, mercenaries of the lower planes. </p>

<p>	It was not alone; a quartet of four-armed trident wielding lesser daemons followed this one, insectoid monsters with burning eyes. The deamons scattered, falling in with contingents of Githyanki, and then they charged. </p>

<p>	“Throw them back!” Shakvail’s senior hefted his naginata. He shouted out the words of a mystic exercise and his muscles bulged with supernatural strength and power.</p>

<p>	Not to be outdone Shakvail invoked her own magic, casting a blessing upon herself and her fellows to harden hearts and sharpen blows.</p>

<p>	Then the charge came on. The insectoid daemon crashed in first, landing hard in a flurry of claws. One of the sohei nevertheless held position well, and slammed his naginata into a break in the creature’s defenses. The blade plunged in between chitin-armor plates.</p>

<p>	When he twisted and pulled out the jagged gash healed instantly, closing in the blink of an eye.</p>

<p>	The daemon cackled with hellish delight. <span style="font-style:italic">“Fools! Your heathen impure weapons cannot harm me!”</span> It spoke not with words, but directly into the minds of its opponents, mocking them and violating them with its fiendish touch at the same time.</p>

<p>	Shakvail rolled through the emptiness past the creature, drawing its attention as best she dared. The creature possessed the ability to shrug of wounds not empowered by some special nature. To the sohei it seemed obvious the fiend was only vulnerable to the holy infusions of the Upper Planes, something in short supply among the godless and self-serving Githyanki. So it would require mighty blows indeed to harm the beast, and her senior, with his augmented strength, had the best chance.</p>

<p>	The daemon stabbed out with its great trident. Shakvail blocked, but the creature bent the blade and threw her away, hurling her upward, where it took some precious seconds to recover, pushing off nothing with will alone.</p>

<p>	Sohei struck at the daemon, and the senior’s blow sank deep enough the creature bellowed in pain. It did not reply using claw or trident, but raised its telepathic voice instead. <span style="font-style:italic">“Have another!”</span></p>

<p>	 A silvery tear in the fabric of the astral appeared beside the demon, and in a moment a second creature tore through the rift and slammed its trident into the nearest sohei. <span style="font-style:italic">“Githyanki?”</span> It bellowed in puzzlement. <span style="font-style:italic">“Ah, just kill’em all!”</span> it gestured and a ball of flame appeared between a set of claws in the moment before it plunged them into the youngest of the sohei. He crumpled with flame spreading all over his body.</p>

<p>	Then the Githyanki attackers charged in to aid the fiends.</p>

<p>	“Fall back!” the senior yelled, knowing they were overmatched. “Defend the corridors!”</p>

<p>	Shakvail flipped back down to the hatch-door, kicking one foe in the head as she passed, and then dashing down. There were screams behind her, and explosions echoed through the fortress. She saw no one else escape with her, but enemies were dashing by. The defense, compromised by the daemons and weakened by the initial fighting, was suddenly coming apart. <span style="font-style:italic">That,</span> she reasoned, <span style="font-style:italic">was why they kept the fiends back in the beginning, so they could overrun us when we were weakened.</span> </p>

<p>	In the confusion of battle the fleeing Githyanki briefly traded blows with two enemies, possibly wounding one, as she fled down the corridors. Her blade snapped before her, moving like a living thing, driven by instinct to cut and block and guard as she ran. Head for the inner sanctum, she determined. Any of the masters who survived would surely head there, to organize a last stand or perhaps a retreat. There were other outposts, other branches of the Crusaders, those might take them, and if not, Shakvail would rather die fighting with her comrades than alone in the tight tunnels of the hall.</p>

<p>	Struck from all sides by powerful blows, destruction and rubble had taken their toll on the pathways, and many were now blocked, while the granite had opened elsewhere, creating doors where there had been walls only hours before. With the rage of battle still burning in her veins the sohei struggled to reorient herself and find her way. Dashing down one path leading deep into the storage rooms near the center of the stone she briefly recalled there was a secret back stair from those regions to the inner sanctum, used during ceremonies. It ought to be clear. She hurried, wounds burning.</p>

<p>	Then suddenly an enemy appeared before her, a tall Githyanki wearing the silvery garb of a Gish, a warrior-mage.</p>

<p>	<span style="font-style:italic">Close!</span> Shakvail hurled her scythe, desperate to bridge the distance before she lost her face to a spell.</p>

<p>	The Gish dodged, floating out of the way toward the top of the hallway, but Shakvail hurled herself toward him as a living missile. </p>

<p>	Recognizing that his deadly spell would not complete in time he cast a simpler one instead, calling a wave of burning flame to burst from his fingers. </p>

<p>	Shakvail smiled and lowered her head. </p>

<p>	The flames struck her, and they easily overcame her natural immunity, but when they flashed over her armor they weakened, the scaled leather absorbing a tremendous quantity of heat easily, the property of brass dragon skin used in its making. She was still burned, and the hallway filled with the wretched stink of burning hair, but Shakvail was conscious and aware as she slammed her head into the Gish’s stomach. “Ki!” she let the righteous rage boil through her body, providing strength and power. </p>

<p>	Shakvail’s left hand shot up to the throat of her enemy and grasped with all her might. With her right she smashed away her opponent’s attempt to grasp his dagger, for the Gish had correctly realized her would have no chance to retrieve his greatsword. </p>

<p>	Hands slammed together and they tumbled, each scrabbling for the small blade desperately, or so it appeared. Shakvail truly did not care for the blade; so long as she could keep from being stabbed it did not matter. She was naturally stronger than this foe, and with her mystical enchancements and Ki frenzy even more so. Slamming them into the wall she squeezed and struck, ramming the Gish’s skullcapped head into the hard granite wall even as she slowly crushed the life from him. With his throat held shut and his arms tangled with her own he could not cast his deadly spells. </p>

<p>	The result was as inevitable as it was brutal, slowly, blood streaming from the back of his head, the light left the Githyanki’s eyes and he collapsed into unconsciousness. Without letting go of his throat Shakvail grabbed the dagger in her left hand and plunged it past the chainmail shirt and into his heart. She pushed away from the body with a shout of triumph.</p>

<p>	Moments later, her frenzy abated, Shakvail gasped and sobbed as a brutal fatigue drained the strength from her limbs and a feeling of absolute disgust settled over her. <span style="font-style:italic">What had become of her kind, of her? Do we kill each other like this now? Are we, the children Gith, the ones who saved the multiverse itself from the Illithids come to this? I cannot do it! I cannot!</span></p>

<p>	In her grief and rage Shakvail made a solemn vow, deep in the timeless expanse of the Astral Plane. </p>

<p>	<span style="font-style:italic">Here me Gith! I forsake your legacy! I will no longer fight for the Githyanki, for your cause has betrayed us! I will find a new destiny to make my own!</span></p>

<p>	She was left inside a dark fortress, surrounded by enemies, and without her proper weapon.</p>

<p>	Looking for her war scythe the sohei found the treasured weapon had cascaded into the wall and snapped in half, becoming useless. She had naught but the dagger taken from the Gish to rely upon, and enemies everywhere around her. Though her resolution was now to flee, her former comrades be damned, for even if they survived today they would no doubt die in some other futile skirmish elsewhere, it seemed impossible to accomplish.</p>

<p>	<span style="font-style:italic">I’ve got to find a way out, a way unwatched.</span> Looking at the wall that had broken her scythe Shakvail was surprised to discover a crack had opened in the granite, a result of the explosions that still shook it even now. It led down and away, to the very center of the stone block their base honeycombed. She had never been down so far, there were rooms only the leaders of the order ever visited. </p>

<p>	It was not a wide crack, but the githyanki, though tall, are a thin race and she conceived that she might squeeze through. There was a glimmer of light at the other end. <span style="font-style:italic">Perhaps a secret passage leads out?</span> Knowing the nature of her people as she did it would have been more surprising if such a thing was not present. Taking a shallow breath the sohei pulled her stomach tight and pressed inside.</p>

<p>	The total distance from the corridor where she had slain the Gish to the light was surely not more than six or seven meters, but it was far longer from within, squeezing fingertip by fingertip, barely able to breath in ancient and stale air. Slowly, so very slowly she progressed, unable to see anything, and her thoughts filled with blood and ambush. <span style="font-style:italic">I’ll get there too late, and everything will be overrun and then the warlocks will torture me to death only to animate my body as some unholy undead monster.</span></p>

<p>	This final thought, of being forced to shamble through life for eternity gave strength to her convictions, and the sohei pushed herself through the narrowest passage and into the final meter, a section not composed of natural granite, but of worked stone.</p>

<p>	<span style="font-style:italic">“What is this, a visitor?”</span> A voice sounded in Shakvail’s head, and she stopped immediately, not daring to breathe.</p>

<p>	<span style="font-style:italic">“Wait,”</span> though it was only in her thoughts the voice had an impossibly deep tone, and spoke with the accumulated wisdom of an incredible weight of years. It was not the thoughtspeach of any Githyanki, but something greater, grander, she knew this intrinsically. <span style="font-style:italic">“You are not one I have met before, not one of the fools who think they rule over me. You are a young one, one of the little sohei. Come, come,”</span> the voice took on a terrible urgency. <span style="font-style:italic">“The bonds are breaking, come, free me!”</span></p>

<p>	Shakvail’s instincts told her to turn and run. Any number of strange beings could speak into minds on the Astral Plane, the plane was composed of thought after all, but almost all these things counted the Githyanki as enemies. If her masters had imprisoned something here she wanted no part of it. Yet one little part of her mind refused to turn back. It reasoned with cold iron logic. To retreat would mean all this time wasted, and there would be no way out. This thing spoke from a secret room and surely represented a secret path to survival and freedom. “It is imprisoned,” she whispered to herself. “It can’t harm me; I’ll just walk past it.”</p>

<p>	She pushed on through to the end.</p>

<p>	It was a small room, a three meter cube at most, and worked of solid blocks of marble, all inscribed with sigils Shakvail’s training did not allow her to recognize, but they seemed deep and powerful, marked in dark red with a strong hand. The script at least was known to her, it was Draconic, a language familiar to almost all Githyanki, for they had an ancient pact with dragons. The room had a thin circular shaft leading in two directions, up into the heart of the fortress near the inner sanctum and down to some place else, a pathway intersecting nothing in the sohei’s memory. Her way out!</p>

<p>	These things all tumbled through her mind as she entered the room, but they were overwhelmed by the object floating in the center of the space. </p>

<p>	It was bound by found great chains, each anchored to one of the walls, ninety degrees apart, and clearly they had been intended to be perfectly taught. Now, with the fragmenting of the walls one of the chains had broken free and the others hung askew, slack in places. Each was clamped around the weapon in the center.</p>

<p>	It was a war scythe, similar to the one Shakvail had wielded before, but the shaft of the weapon was not made of any wood, instead composed of some strange mystical substance blending the appearance of metal and ceramic. This straight pole supported a simple wide-curving blade, not much longer than it was wide, unlike the slender blades of scythes carried by druids or other mystics in battle. The blade was utterly perfect in sharpness and luster, but whatever substance it was composed of held no mirroring property, and would not reveal any reflection. </p>

<p>	Magical power radiated from it like heat from a raging fire.</p>

<p>	“Release me!” the scythe, and now the Githyanki woman new it was the weapon itself that had spoken, bellowed, no longer in her mind, it spoke aloud, saying the words in draconic, with all the power and bombast of an ancient dragon. </p>

<p>	She wanted to touch the weapon, it called to her, offering power and release, but Shakvail was not without caution. She did not know what this thing was, and it could well be a trap for the unwary. Why had it been imprisoned here? Dangerous such a thing might be, but if it was at all useful surely her masters would have wielded it. Rarely were tools of power refused. “Who are you blade?” Shakvail demanded, speaking in draconic as well, a tongue her father, who had ridden dragons in battles against the Githzerai, had taught her. “Why are you held here?”</p>

<p>	“So you speak a proper tongue,” the weapon remarked with pleasant surprise. “Poorly, but allowances must be made for such weak little throats. I am <span style="font-style:italic">Exlevix *Haurach* zyak.</span>” It pronounced with great magisterial pomp.</p>

<p>	Though the sohei considered herself a fluent speaker of draconic, this was a title beyond her easy grasp. Struggling to translate she came up with ‘Ineffable Fate.’</p>

<p>	<span style="font-style:italic">“’Inscrutable Fate,’ you miserable excuse for a rescuer,”</span> the scythe barked into her mind. “Now free me!” it spoke aloud again.</p>

<p>	Shakvail crossed her arms carefully. She suspected she could indeed free the weapon, the fragmentation of the walls had cleared undone any wards, it would only require manually unwinding the chains, but she was not ready to do so yet. The blade could well be cursed, or it might simply attempt to dominate her mind. “You have not told me why you are held here.”</p>

<p>	“The arrogance of the Githyanki amazes me,” the scythe’s words were filled with disdain. “But, as I see you will not release me otherwise, very well. I was imprisoned her by your precious Lich-Queen, Vlaakith, who feared I might spill secrets she dared not let known.”</p>

<p>	“What secrets?” the sohei wondered what knowledge a weapon could possibly possess that would inspire such fear in the Lich-Queen. Perhaps it was simply because Vlaakith had been mad. <span style="font-style:italic">Odd,</span> Shakvail thought for a moment. <span style="font-style:italic">When was a child I was taught to worship Vlakkith, and now I think of her as nothing more than a crazy lich; how quickly things have changed, and how great her betrayal.</span></p>

<p>	“Are you certain you want to know little one?” the blade teased. “Your Lich-Queen will hunt you down forever for it, and your race will call you a traitor.”</p>

<p>	“Vlaakith is dead,” Shakvail said flatly. “And my people, as things stand now, have no future, so I am not worried.”</p>

<p>	The scythe laughed, a deep throaty sound as if it was a creature many meters in length and large as a building. “Dead is it? How grand! And you are willing to turn you back on her legacy, well then, that is interesting. I will tell you then. You know of the bargain between your people and the red dragons I assume?”</p>

<p>	The sohei nodded. </p>

<p>	“The story goes that Gith went to the Nine Hells to barter with Tiamat for the services of the red dragons, and the dragons gave to the first Vlaakith the Red Dragon Staff and the pact in return for Gith’s soul,” all this was known to the sohei, for it was the legendary history of her people. “Ephelomon, Tiamat’s consort and one of the mightiest dragons to ever wing through the planes, told the Githyanki that Vlaakith was to be Gith’s successor. What the Githyanki do not know is that this is a lie.”</p>

<p>	“What?” Shakvail could not believe this revelation, for if true it meant the Githyanki had been ruled by a usurper for thousands of millennia. “You mean to say Gith named another?”</p>

<p>	“No,” the scythe could not provide motion or expression to its words, but somehow there was the impression of a great beast shaking its head in impatience. “Gith did not name any successor whatsoever, and she had no offspring, so Vlaakith would no doubt have ruled the race as a matter of course. The lie is that Gith made any agreement with Tiamat at all.”</p>

<p>	“But the pact, it exists!” the sohei began to consider the possibility the blade was either a liar or mad. “My father rode red dragons into battle!”</p>

<p>	“Oh certainly, the pact does exist,” the weapon agreed. “Tiamat was not such a fool as to provide nothing to the Githyanki in return for absorbing the soul of one of the mightiest mortals ever born. Indeed, I suspect Asmodeus himself demanded the sacrifice of her, lest her power grow too great within his realm, but Tiamat gained far more. Forging a link to the Githyanki allowed her influence over you and the humans who followed from it, it is that event that allows her to create her spawn in humanoid forms, reclaiming an advantage her enemy Bahamut had obtained earlier. Indeed, if not for the Githyanki the Dragonfall War would likely have ended millennia ago.”</p>

<p>	Little the weapon said made any sense to Shakvail’s hearing. It referenced strange things barely known to her or totally unrecognized. “How do you know this, scythe?” she demanded, trying to regain balance.</p>

<p>	“I was forged long ago by the concordant great wyrm Ewethalmach, a servant of Chronepsis the Death Dragon to chronicle the rise and fall of dragonkind across the multiverse. I know many secrets to break the minds of lesser creatures,” the weapon’s words rose with pride and potency, and left no doubt it spoke the truth. “Held here I have been kept from my duties by the decree of the wretched Vlaakith. You say she is dead sohei, so free me and let me conduct the work wherefore I was made!”</p>

<p>	A blade created as a repository of lore seemed unusual, an intelligent book would have made more sense to the Githyanki, but, she reasoned wryly, dragons have little use for most books, so perhaps a weapon made more sense. “If I release you, I will wield you, and your work will be as my blade,” Shakvail had no intention of serving some weapon.</p>

<p>	“You presume to-“</p>

<p>	“If I don’t free you you’re going to end up in the hands of some grasping warlock in less than an hour, and you’ll spend the next ten thousand years in the petty wars of my people!” she snapped. “Me,” she paused, she really did not know what would happen if she survived to leave this place, her home since childhood, but she knew it would not be to fight pointless Githyanki wars. “Well, let us say I am open to new possibilities.”</p>

<p>	“Very well sohei,” the intelligent weapon agreed. “We have a bargain, but you shall not call me ‘scythe’ or some other degrading term. I have a proper name; I expect it to be used.”</p>

<p>	The warrior woman reached out and grasped the first of the chains, exerting herself to wrench it free from about the shaft of the scythe. “Your name’s too long Exlevix, I’ll go with that,” she smirked. “And I have a name too, Shakvail.”</p>

<p>	“Impudent wretch!” the dragon-forged weapon cursed deeply. “Just hurry, I ache to be released.”</p>

<p>	One by one the chains fell away, and when she jabbed the dagger in to break the last chain link the masterful weapon floated freely into her hand as if capable of its own propulsion, which on the Astral perhaps it was, for anything with a mind could move here. Shakvail felt a ripple of power as she took hold of the scythe. It fit perfectly in her grip, with exquisite balance. Never had she held an object anywhere near as fine. “Let us go Exlevix,” she told the weapon as she plunged down into the cylindrical passage that must lead out.</p>

<p>	“Free! Free at last! Praise to all merciful deities!” the weapon glorified telepathically. “May Vlaakith’s soul burn forever in the pit of Baator!”</p>

<p>	The passage, wrought from magic, was perfectly smooth, and plunged straight as a crossbow bolt in flight down to the base of the granite. There it met a plug, and the sohei understood it must fit seamlessly with the surface on the outside, thereby avoiding detection. </p>

<p>	“Hmm, this won’t be easy,” she muttered. It would take great strength to remove the block; no doubt it was intended to be freed using telekinetic power. On another plane, able to brace herself and use gravity to her advantage the task would be easier. With nothing to push off against save her mind the challenge was far greater. </p>

<p>	“Idiot, anchor me into the wall and use my shaft as a brace,” Exlevix whispered.</p>

<p>	“You can cut into stone?”</p>

<p>	“I am a mystical artifact of considerable potency youthful creature,” and for a brief moment the scythe exerted the full force of its mind against Shakvail. In the storm of power to follow it was all the Githyanki could do to retain focus on her core self, loosing track of everything around her. “Do not question what I claim to be capable of again.”</p>

<p>	<span style="font-style:italic">If I try to fight the scythe I won’t be able to do anything else,</span> she knew absolutely. <span style="font-style:italic">It might even take control of me as surely as an Illithid.</span> The very thought was something she could not abide, so grudgingly Shakvail nodded and accepted she would have to compromise with the weapon. Then she drove it forcefully into the wall, relishing the reverberations.</p>

<p>	Gathering her strength, the sohei contorted her whole body and then slammed down on the plug of rock, and it cracked off and then began to move, ever so slowly, an almost infinitesimal progression. </p>

<p>	On the Astral Plane there is no air to provide friction, and combined with no gravity, nothing to stop an object once in motion; even moving so very slowly the plug would eventually be released. </p>

<p>	Shakvail knew she could not wait that long, and she stomped down again, sending several tons of granite flying forth from its housing with the appearance of a cork launching free of a champagne bottle. </p>

<p>	Knowing the movement would surely be observed, she blasted free behind it.</p>

<p>	Shakvail dropped away from the granite backdrop, picked a clear direction away from the enemy astral cruisers, and accelerated to full speed. </p>

<p>	A Githyanki in the astral plane is as fast as anything but no faster than her fellows, and they moved swiftly to give chase. Her head start would still have been enough to get away on some prime material world, but here there were no obstacles to visibility and no end to the distance before her. She could run until her will collapsed, and if one of those pursuing proved stronger in that regard, then she’d be helpless before them. Nevertheless, Shakvail knew she could not fight half-a-dozen Githyanki warriors alone, certainly not wounded as she already was. </p>

<p>	Of course, the enemy had no intentions of waiting.</p>

<p>	So suddenly it took all the concentration she could muster to avoid slamming herself onto the tines of its brutal trident, one of the insectoid daemons materialized in front of her. “How?” she screamed in shock.</p>

<p>	<span style="font-style:italic">“Teleportation,”</span> Exlevix, replied inside her mind. <span style="font-style:italic">“Now attack!”</span></p>

<p>	There was nothing else to do as the daemon stabbed out in a swift charge.</p>

<p>	Shakvail blocked desperately, and then pivoted, exchanging ringing blows against the monster. It was fast and strong, and brutally confident in the way of creatures that do not fear their own deaths. Its crude mind hurled telepathic insults as it fought, laughing with vicious glee.</p>

<p>	Knowing she needed every advantage Shakvail once again invoked her Ki frenzy, though she suspected doing so meant her doom if the pursuers caught her. Strength and righteous rage flooded her body, and a sense of cruel anticipation.</p>

<p>	The daemon stabbed, swinging its second pair of arms around low.</p>

<p>	Shakvail spun through the air perpendicular to the blow, moving innately in the absence of gravity and taking advantage of the fiend’s lack of familiarity with the Astral. She twisted around and brought the scythe with her, bringing the blade up and over with tremendous force as her body flashed above the creature’s head. </p>

<p>	The blade arced deep into the daemon’s armored back, smashing through the plates and down to the soft organs beneath.</p>

<p>	For an instant if laughed, the blow had been powerful, but the creature’s resistance to wounds would yet save it from death.</p>

<p>	Then something changed. Shakvail felt a surge of energy down her weapon and something in the blade shifted. “Imbecile,” Exlevix hissed in draconic. “I am a claw of the one truly inevitable fate: death. There is nothing I cannot kill.”</p>

<p>	Howls twisting into a crude gurgle the daemon collapsed inward as the githyanki twisted the blade free in a wrenchingly destructive motion. Gore floated free into the astral, whitish and milky, not like the blood of a man at all, and then the fiend was silent. </p>

<p>	“Nice one,” Shakvail commented to the weapon. “I could get used to that trick.”</p>

<p>	<span style="font-style:italic">“Only if you survive to use it again,”</span> Exlevix switched back to mental speech. <span style="font-style:italic">“They are coming, move!”</span></p>

<p>	“Where?” she gasped in desperation, knowing of no refuge she might reach.</p>

<p>	“Anywhe-,” the blade cut itself off. “No! A color pool, will yourself to the nearest color pool. They’ll not pursue beyond the Astral.”</p>

<p>	As insane as such a move was, the sohei followed the weapon’s instruction, for he was correct. No Githyanki force would pursue beyond the Astral, indeed many would crumble to dust from their accumulated years if they should but step beyond its timeless lanes. She did not have such fears personally, for her order left the Astral regularly to fight for the righteous cause of Gith’s legacy. Indeed, she had left the plane not a few months previously to face allies of the Githzerai on the Prime Material.</p>

<p>	Of course, heading at random to a gateway to just about anywhere in the Outer Planes was anything but a safe maneuver, but you had to figure about even odds of reaching a survivable place. For a woman running for her life from six angry Githyanki warriors, even odds looked pretty good. </p>

<p>	It was a strange sort of race, each party moving at ridiculously high speeds through an infinite empty sky and never changing their relative positions. Occasionally some vast rolling conduit could be observed in the distance, or there would be the startled face of some creature flashing by before it faded almost immediately into a speck, but nothing disturbed them. It would have been almost relaxing, except that one of her pursuers had a crossbow, and kept taking ballistic shots onto her pathway far ahead, so she had to pay attention or risk the ignominy of ramming into a crossbow bolt.</p>

<p>	Then, after what was surely hours, and with her mind feeling like sludge, the color pool was suddenly there. The sohei was brought up short before it, and took only a second to analyze the shifting color. It was strange, a dull silver color was primary, meaning some miserable Prime Material world, but there was something off, as if the liquid pool was moving in a slow, languid spiral. “I don’t know where this leads…” she mumbled in a moment of hesitation.</p>

<p>	“Unless you want to find out where death leads, go!” the scythe demanded, for her pursuers were all but upon her.</p>

<p>	She went through.</p>

<p>	Normally transition through a color pool was seamless, just a brief sensation of moisture, as if stepping into a pool of water exactly at body temperature. This time there was a brutal wrenching, and Shakvail felt as if her body as been turned to gas, then powder, and then baked into flour. “Whaaaa-“ she tried to speak but the words were seemingly absorbed.</p>

<p>	Then she blacked out.</p>

<p>	<span style="font-style:italic">“Wake up, hurry, hurry up you stupid Githyanki, awaken!”</span> Exlevix’s voice berated her mind brutally, the powerful booms of an angry dragon. She hissed, but they did the job.</p>

<p>	<span style="font-style:italic">“Do not speak!”</span> the scythe admonished once she had awakened.</p>

<p>	Painfully Shakvail opened her eyes, only to find she was floating in a vast sea of foggy cloud. There was no ground beneath her feet, but she could see it perhaps ten meters below, and the ghostly representations of prime material vegetation, grass and flowers and all the other green things so common there. She tried to figure out what had happened, but nothing made sense. <span style="font-style:italic">“This is the Ethereal,”</span> she whispered mentally to the blade, assuming it could hear here thoughts while she held it. <span style="font-style:italic">“But that is impossible.”</span></p>

<p>	<span style="font-style:italic">“It should be, yes,”</span> Exlevix admitted, and the weapon’s confusion was truly frightening. <span style="font-style:italic">“You cannot transition directly from the Astral to the Ethereal, but that is not what happened. We were on the Prime Material Plane for the barest of instants. Then we were pulled into the Ethereal. Some powerful magic has rent a tear in the barriers between planes on this world.”</span></p>

<p>	<span style="font-style:italic">“What could do that?”</span></p>

<p>	<span style="font-style:italic">“I do not know, but whoever it was, they are nearby, listen,”</span> the weapon cautioned.</p>

<p>	The sohei did, and she learned that it is possible to hear considerably further than one can see in the obscuring fog. The unmistakable sounds of spell battle echoed down to her. Someone was fighting with powerful magic nearby; very powerful if the muffling of those explosions was as she guessed. <span style="font-style:italic">“I don’t think we want to stick around and meet these people,”</span> she told the scythe.</p>

<p>	<span style="font-style:italic">“I agree. I have no interest in some Prime Material war either,”</span> Exlevix explained. <span style="font-style:italic">“All you need to do to escape is to will yourself into the deep ethereal. Focus and make it so, feel for the ocean of empty potential. Imaging the Astral Plane ought to do.”</span></p>

<p>	This seemed simple enough, and even drained as she was it was possible for Shakvail to call up an empty sky in her mind and take herself there. The ground below, echo of the Prime world, fell away, and in its place a vast curtain of color appeared on the distance horizon, waving like some ever-changing flag of infinite size. Besides this curtain there was nothing to see but the endless fog.</p>

<p>	“Now what,” she grumbled to the scythe. “Sit here and starve?”</p>

<p>	“Humph, of course not, you impatient Githyanki,” Exlevix sounded positively insulted. “Any location in the Deep Ethereal can be reached by willing yourself there, once you have a description.”</p>

<p>	“That’d be great, if I knew of any places in the Ethereal,” starving to death was starting to look likely, and the sohei began to regret not simply fighting to the last with her comrades. If she had left them only to die for nothing, it would be an unconscionable crime. <span style="font-style:italic">I will not die like this!</span></p>

<p>	“You may not, but I do,” the weapon spoke as if quite pleased. “Like most planes the Ethereal is not without dragons in residence, and draconic locales. There is a small temple to Aasterinian, the Wayside on the Road to Everything, where we can find at least temporary shelter.” Even as he spoke the words an image of the temple popped into Shakvail’s mind, and she knew she could reach it.</p>

<p>	“Which of the dragon gods is Aasterinian?” she wondered. A little of Tiamat and her enemy Bahamut was about the extent of the sohei’s knowledge of that pantheon. </p>

<p>	“Io’s daughter and his messenger,” the weapon’s voice immediately became scholarly. “She is a demigod, and presides over travel, learning, pleasure, and related affairs.”</p>

<p>	Assuming the scythe was telling the truth, and Shakvail doubted the weapon was capable of distorting the lore it had been forged to keep, she suspected she could survive such a temple. </p>

<p>	“Let’s go then,” she willed herself forward into the Ethereal’s mists, beginning the first journey on her search for a true cause.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Notes on Mysteries and Mechanics</span><br />
1.	Shakvail has levels in Sohei, a class that casts divine spells even though the Githyanki are effectively godless, however, I am inclined to treat Sohei ‘spells’ more as supernatural manifestations of their esoteric training. I feel the Sohei concept fits well with the Githyanki, as a sort of paladin/barbarian cross. Also, it’s a fun chance to treat a much-neglected class. The Sohei are found in Oriental Adventures, but Shakvail uses the 3.5 conversion to the class found in Dragon #318.</p>

<p>2.	This story is obviously set some time post incursion, and this incident presumes upon a high degree of infighting among the Githyanki, which seems only logical. </p>

<p>3.	Writing 3D, no-gravity combat is a new twist for me, and it’s probably going to take some work to pin down. Comments in this regard would be helpful.</p>

<p>4.	Exlevix *Haurach* zyak – Inscrutable Fate. Haurach actually does mean fate in draconic, it’s one of the words listed in the Draconomicon, zyak means ‘to’ and exlevix in made up, but taken from ‘levex, meaning enchanted, which is the closest the vocabulary selection comes to inscrutable.</p>

<p>5.	Exlevix is an intelligent weapon with all the properties thereof. He has the Transmuting property (from the Magic Item Compendium) which is why he can damage Mezzoloths, which have damage reduction 10/good. In addition to his knowledge, he has some other modest powers that shall be revealed later.</p>

<p>6.	As to what Exlevix says about Gith and Tiamat, well, who knows? There’s no canonical definition of how that one went down to my knowledge. The scythe could always be wrong anyway, its knowledge, while vast, is anything but perfect.</p>

<p>7.	Though it has no real consequence for the story, the tear in the Ethereal/Prime Material boundary referenced here as a story device to get Shakvail to the Ethereal (where this tale’s action is) is the result of Ethergaunt activity destroying the nameless prime world in question.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Chapter 2: Searching amid Soulseers</span></p>

<p>	Meter for meter the Mouth of Slaan is one of the busiest places in the multiverse, with a nonstop traffic of airships, teleporting spellships, teleporting wagons, massive winged caravans, and people just plain falling in from the rest of the Paraelemental Plane of Smoke. A man who stood on the side of one dock for an hour, assuming he could manage it without being hauled away by some Khaasta patroller for obstructing business, might see more different races and more coin change hands than he would in a lifetime almost anywhere else. It was all extremely impressive, but to anyone not familiar with planar metropoli it was also very overwhelming.</p>

<p>	“Great Io aid me in this living maze,” Saern whispered as he headed out onto the massive docks of the airships. He had come to the city the day before, but via a portal from Sigil and from The Citadel of Ice and Steel in Elemental Air before that. The strain of these teeming places, so different from where he had previously served, was beginning to wear him down.</p>

<p>	At least the residents of this city were more comforting than in the sharp towers of Sigil. Lizardfolk and other reptilians, here troglodytes, here an Asabi, there something truly exotic outside his knowledge, crowded the streets, making up the bulk of the populace. There were many humans of course, he was not alone by any means, and also the general gatherings of the planes, tieflings, aasimar, mephlings and many, many others, but scales dominated. </p>

<p>	Good, the priest thought. It was good to see a place like this, to see the many reptilian kindred engaged in fruitful and productive, if somewhat cutthroat, pursuits, rather than the brutish violence seen in so many other lands. It was almost a pity he had to leave so swiftly, he would have liked to spend more time at the House of Dragonkind. He had seen no other temple to Io and his children even close to its match, and he doubted he would again. Duties wait however; it is enough to cherish the memory.</p>

<p>	Regrettably his duty required navigating among these people to find a ship that might carry him on his way. Looking out at the bustle, Saern was not sure even where to begin. He would rather have simply asked a senior priest to plane shift him, but the vision had implied a conveyance, and high priest Nersel had been adamant this meant a ship must be used. </p>

<p>	“The Ninefold One’s ways may seem circuitous to us, young one,” the elderly half-dragon lizardman had told him sternly. “But his gaze is all knowing and all encompassing. Your actions have drawn that gaze, and now you must be willing to follow where it leads.”</p>

<p>	“If only I had the old one’s easy trust,” he muttered, and passed his hand over the left side of his plate armor. There, next to his coin purse, hidden from the city’s many pickpockets, was the reason for his quest. Even though he could not see it from the hiding place, and it was wrapped securely in a silk cloth, his mind’s eye recalled it perfectly, the image that had astonished him when he pulled it from the ancient vault in the Plane of Ooze.</p>

<p>	A small statue standing only about as high as his pinky finger was long, cast in the shape of a dragon. It was perfectly crafted of a strange metal no one had readily recognized by sight alone, and the dragon’s markings were not those of any dragon breed known to Saern or to any priest at the House of Dragonkind, a great repository of knowledge. Of course, it should have been possible to simply invoke the power of the idol and ask the dragon who answered the call of its nature, but all attempts to do so had failed. The figurine’s magic was long dissipated.</p>

<p>	Yet Io had not left his young follower totally despondent. In the meditation at the shift of hours when the red light of Slaan’s base stone brightened he had received a vision wherein he held the idol high and invoked its power successfully. He had stood in a circle of pillars in some gray expanse, surrounded by spires of impossible height, and sharp and serrated, as if each where the fang of a great beast. He could recall only that he had been conveyed to this place through a vast, foggy sea.</p>

<p>	Saern was not a cleric without experience, he had been devoted to Io for seven years, and had sought to fortify the cause of all dragons across the planes through many struggles, but he had known his wisdom insufficient to interpret such a vision. The High Priest, however, had seen much from his description, validating the young man’s choice to come to Slaan.</p>

<p>	“An ocean of fog suggests the Ethereal Plane,” Nersel had explained with patience. “The strange scene you observed matches a fragmentary description of one of the countless demiplanes there, the Dragon’s Maw. It is a good candidate in many ways. If that idol represents some strange branch of dragon kind found only in one place in the multiverse, a demiplane is likely. Indeed, I have heard legendary tales of such things.”</p>

<p>	The young man had requested the temple send another senior priest with him to investigate, or at lest some aid, but Nersel had demurred, claiming that Io had given him the vision alone for a reason. Saern count not avid a recalling his weak feelings at that moment, believing the High Priest did not take him seriously simply because he was human, his ties to the dragon gods pitifully weak compared to a lizardman who was half-crystal dragon. It had been an unworthy doubt, he knew, and he would have to struggle to make it up to the Ninefold Dragon. </p>

<p>	Waiting here on the dock won’t help, he admonished as he pulled away from the reverie. Catching the glimpse of an iguana-like humanoid, he dimly believed they were called Ipsosaurs, who was calling out to travelers that he was a guide, Saern pushed forward to ask a question.</p>

<p>	“I’m looking for a ship to take me to the Ethereal,” he spoke in his best Draconic; though regrettably the human tongue could not do the sibilant language full justice. “Do you know of one?”</p>

<p>	“I’m a guide to the city not out of it you-“ the Ipsosaur caught a glimpse of the melded-multicolor disk painted onto Saern’s chestplate and shield and stuttered a pause. “Apologies honored one; I did not know you were in the Swallower of Shades service.” The respect was all-too-new to Saern, for this was one of the few times since leaving home he had been among a populace that revered the same deities as he. “A ship to the Ethereal was it?”</p>

<p>	Saern nodded, one of the few gestures all but universal on the planes.</p>

<p>	“Ah, well, I do not know where anyone is going, precisely,” the guide clicked his tongue against his jawbone. “But on the third pier from us are a number of vessels that travel across many Inner Planes, and with captains willing to consider passengers. It will not come cheap of course.”</p>

<p>	“Of course not, my thanks,” the cleric passed the guide a few coins from the inside of his left gauntlet and headed in the direction advised.</p>

<p>	The pier in question was a long section of planking rising high up from the lip of the great stone shell that formed the walls of Slaan. It extended out into the inky blackness of the Paraelemental Plane of Smoke, but Saern would not walk that far. Though he might call upon Io’s aid to survive the toxic vapors, he would not take passage on a ship without clean air.</p>

<p>	Several captains and crew asked him of his desire as he passed their vessels, but all shook their head when he mentioned the Ethereal Plane. They were headed elsewhere, to the great genie cities mostly, for trade, and saw no reason to detour. Several questioned why one man alone should not simply hire a mage, though Saern did not bother to answer them. The business of the church was its own. </p>

<p>	He came to the last vessel, moored at the very edge of the gravity that held to the city in a plane otherwise lacking it, brushing up against the glassy membrane forming the boundary of the Mouth. There rested a ship unlike anything he had ever seen. It had the outward design of a sailing ship, even to the point of having masts with spars, but it had no sails, and strange protrusions to no nautical purpose hung from the decks and castles. The vessel was not made of wood, seemingly entirely created of metal, shining silver and black, and festooned with gears and other strange contraptions. He had never been to Mechanus, but this vessel looked like it ought to have originated in that plane of mechanical order.</p>

<p>	“You seek passage?” a voice, harsh and grating in the common tongue of planewalkers, called down from above. </p>

<p>	“To the Ethereal Plane, yes,” Saern called back. “Are you bound there?”</p>

<p>	A man in black robes appeared atop the gangplank. He was human, outwardly, though something about him seemed off, altered, to the priest’s senses. He muttered a brief prayer to reveal more, only to have it show nothing, blocked by a ward. The man had dark black hair and a grim, stiff face. He wore long metal gloves on his arms, with many rivets. “A priest of Io then?” he looked at Saern with an unblinking gaze, pupils unnaturally focused. “What do you seek in the Ethereal? Where do you wish to go there?”</p>

<p>	Ignoring the first question, Saern answered the second. “A demiplane, the Dragon’s Maw.”</p>

<p>	“A demiplane,” the robed man grimaced. “I will not detour to such a place for a sole passenger. I am bound to Farer’s Freehold, headquarters of the Etherfarer Society. I can take you there, and the Etherfarers can show you the way to any demiplane you can imagine.”</p>

<p>	The cleric had done his share of Planewalking, and had even been to the Ethereal once before, very briefly. He had heard of the Etherfarers, though he knew little more than that they were explorers. Still, it seemed likely this would be the best offer he would get; perhaps he could find another vessel once on the Ethereal. The vision had not implied he took the same ship the whole way after all. “That might be acceptable, but whose ship is this?”</p>

<p>	“I am Atactect,” the man proclaimed. “This is my ship, <span style="font-style:italic">Composite Caravel</span>. For three hundred and fifty pieces of gold I will carry you to Farer’s Freehold. I will provide you a room, but you must bring your own blankets, if you wish them, and your own rations.”</p>

<p>	This was well within Saern’s capabilities and though the price was regrettably steep he could tell Atactect was not a believer in haggling. He wondered why there would not be food or other accommodations, but reasoned that the man probably did not regularly carry passengers, and as he was assuredly a wizard perhaps he had gotten around the requirement to eat. “How long will the journey take?”</p>

<p>	“I shall leave Slaan at midnight tonight,” Atactect answered. “I have a stop to make in Smoke before transitioning to the Ethereal, but I expect to arrive at Farer’s Freehold in two to three days, given the inherent uncertainty of ethereal travel I cannot predict better.”</p>

<p>	“We have a deal then,” the cleric moved to the edge of the gangplank and extend his hand.</p>

<p>	Atactect shook the gauntleted hand with his own metal gloves, and projected a grip considerably greater than his thin frame appeared capable of offering. “Return here at one hour before midnight. I consider the word of your church good, so it will be payment upon arrival.”</p>

<p>	Though he did not like the strange wizard, there were too many obvious secrets being kept, the cleric had to nod kindly at this, an excellent gesture of respect to his faith, and one many planar traders would not have made. “One hour before midnight then.” It was not very long, not really, especially as he would need to gather up some extra provisions, but Saern thought he had enough time to visit the House of Dragonkind again before leaving. </p>

<p>	He wished to take whatever solace he could before journeying in to the dank sea of strange possibility that was the Ethereal Plane.</p>

<p>	It took less time than Atactect required to castoff for Saern to recognize Composite Caravel was like no other ship he had ever seen or heard mentioned in story and song. She had no crew, only her black-robed captain, but her parts moved seamlessly according to the silent commands given from the helm, where black wires bonded to those strange metal gloves of the man who stood impassively there. The masts turned about in response to unseen and unheard planar winds, gears spun, ropes wound, and nozzles and funnels whose purpose was opaque to the priest performed strange processes. </p>

<p>	He had first thought the ship moved in response to some unseen crew, invisible conjurations or undead, but had called upon Io to augment his sight and found nothing. He was forced to conclude the ship functioned as some kind of giant machine, with the captain serving as its brain. It was tremendously impressive, a construct of such size and complexity, but equally it was disturbing. Saern did not think it right that a man should travel the planes in such lonesomeness. To control a vessel like this, would it not drive a man mad? Looking at Atactect, he was certainly forced to question the man’s, if he could properly be called that, sanity.</p>

<p>	After the ship smoothly left the dock and began to fly through the blackness of the plane of smoke, its deck shrouded over but protected by a halo of uncorrupted air, Saern had to gradually reconsider his prejudice. The ship’s progress was completely smooth, and Atactect apparently knew exactly where he was going even in the impenetrable darkness of the smoke. <span style="font-style:italic">Perhaps,</span> the priest considered, <span style="font-style:italic">as a follower of the great natural creatures, dragons; I fear machines that seem to challenge their supremacy.</span> He was uncertain, but he thought it a wise topic to explore during the journey. Any follower of Io must constantly be willing to embrace all he experienced. </p>

<p>	Standing motionless at the helm of his vessel, Atactect did not move or speak, and eventually, with nothing but smoke to observe, Saern simply settled down to his prayers and blotted out what was passing. </p>

<p>	Timekeeping in the Inner Planes was difficult, and Saern had little idea of how much time had passed when Atactect finally called out to him. “We have almost arrived at the first stop priest. For your own safety, leave the deck, there is a small room behind me that shall serve.”</p>

<p>	“My own safety?” the cleric scowled at the captain, distrusting those words. </p>

<p>	“I do not expect an attack,” Atactect’s voice was flat, machine-like. “But these Belkers can be hungry creatures, it would be best not to tempt them unduly. I would rather complete the exchange without incident.”</p>

<p>	“I guess that’s reasonable,” Saern didn’t find the prospect of meeting with elementals with a fiendish reputation very appealing, so he was more than willing to stand aside. He’d keep a sharp ear out though, for he most certainly only trusted Atactect so far. </p>

<p>	The room the black-robed captain directed him to was little more than a two meter metal cube, with one single bolted hatch, which opened and closed by itself, something that already seemed commonplace after only a few hours onboard. Once it shut behind him the darkness was more or less complete.</p>

<p>	Saern shrugged when this occurred, and whispered a simple prayer to conjure a light. The little glowing orb floated before him, providing a soft illumination throughout the enclosed space, but nothing that would be visible through the sealed door. Then he settled down with his back to the wall and waited, listening. The hard metal flooring was annoying, but not a major privation, he was used to enduring harsh conditions in his duties. The dragon gods were not in the practice of taking weaklings into their churches.</p>

<p>	Though the cleric had initially hoped to hear something of the conversation between his mysterious captain and the belkers, it quickly became clear that would not be possible. Composite Caravel was anything but silent, even when at rest powerful internal machinery whirred, thrummed, and rumbled continuously on a low frequency. When they stopped it was worse, for some sort of mechanism was activated that made a great deal of noise, squealing and clanking. Saern supposed it must be whatever was used to open the hold and unload cargo. He was sure Atactect thought stacking crates well beneath his importance. </p>

<p>	The noise quieted eventually, and Saern, close to nodding off, was jolted when the ship started moving again. He carefully stretched his muscles, for falling asleep in armor was a bad idea without proper preparation. Then again, he didn’t think taking it off would be a good idea during any part of this journey. Whispering a quick spell to ward off fatigue, he then called out to the captain. “Is it clear to come out now?”</p>

<p>	It was unclear whether or not the cleric’s voice managed to pass through the thick metal door, but even if it did not this did not appear necessary.</p>

<p>	“Yes,” the flat voice of the wizard-captain answered, and the door spun open. Saern stepped out into the unending black clouds of smoke to see the ship in apparently the same state as before. There was no real evidence of any meeting at all. </p>

<p>	“Stand behind me,” Atactect instructed. “I am preparing to make the transition across planes, and it would be best if you were there.”</p>

<p>	“Is this dangerous?” the cleric shuddered, wondering what was involved beyond the normally simple process of a plane shift spell.</p>

<p>	“Not usually,” the black-robed man shook his head with a single slashing motion. “But there are powerful energies involved in transitioning something of this mass. It is best not to take any risks.”</p>

<p>	Even as he spoke a quartet of flywheels, to the bow and stern on each side of the vessel, began to spin with astonishing speed. Electrical energy sparked between them, sometimes the usual blue white of lightning, sometimes other fearsome colors. As the whirring grew they began to discharge powerful bolts of energy upwards to the twin masts. “Alignment good,” Atactect intoned, and the cleric suspected he was speaking for the benefit of his guest. “Ten seconds to threshold. No errors. Five…four…three…two…one…” One of the wires connecting to the gloves snapped free, only to be immediately replaced by another. “Threshold reached, breaching…”</p>

<p>	The sparks flew from the flywheels en masse, a grand storm of bolts the size of a man, spearing up the masts and then launching forth again, spraying outward in a wide circle above the ship. As if they were arrows cast to circle the edge of some grand target the jolts of power impacted with something unseen above. The smoke clouds roiled and then something beyond normal sight…rippled…tore, and there was a gaping hole above the ship. The moment the rift formed it exerted an unbelievable quantity of pressure, hauling the whole ship up and through in a single, gut-wrenching instant.<br />
 <br />
	“Io defend…” Saern felt the world twist, and pull, and for a long second felt as thought he was being stretched from the height of the highest mountain all the way to the ground.</p>

<p>	Then everything stopped, and they were surrounded by a vast sea of slow-rolling gray fog. </p>

<p>	Clenching his teeth and refusing to appear weak in front of the steely-eyed Atactect, Saern swallowed a mouthful of bile and took a series of long, slow breaths to quiet his stomach. “Well, that was probably the least fun way I’ve ever switched from one plane to another,” he muttered. </p>

<p>	“Admittedly,” there was the slightest hint of regret in Atactect’s voice. “The planar breaches I use to travel with <span style="font-style:italic">Composite Caravel</span> are more turbulent than standard shifts or portals. However, they are one of the most effective ways to transport bulk cargo in the inner planes, ethereal plane, and the wildspace of the prime material. Most large vessels use a similar method, though by extending the breaching time the journey can be made more comfortable, I feel this entails unnecessary risks.”</p>

<p>	“Right,” the cleric shrugged. Such theory was well beyond his knowledge. <span style="font-style:italic">Io’s blessing will carry me where I need go in the future, I hope.</span> He regretted his faith and training were not yet strong enough to cast such a spell on his own. </p>

<p>	“Well, there is no point in sitting here,” Atactect muttered. Responding to an unseen command, the mechanical vessel came about and began heading through the churning ethereal mists. “You may rest, if you wish,” the captain offered. “The journey should be uneventful.”</p>

<p>	“I’ll stay up, thanks,” Saern replied, to which the wizard only shrugged.</p>

<p>	After a short period of watching what turned out to be more or less endless empty fog pass by, the cleric settled down to eat a modest meal from the travelers rations he had purchased in Slaan. Roasted strips of what could only be called ‘starfish’ made up the majority of the meal. Supposedly they grew outside the city on great cables, and drew their sustenance from the Smoke itself. Saern quickly concluded that their taste was lousy enough for him to believe it. Still, they were hearty and filling and he felt better after choking a few down. The wise planewalker eats when he can, for he never knows where the next meal may be found, the aphorism had been taught to him by his mentor when he was first called to journey, and he had seen it proven several times since. </p>

<p>	The ship’s travel was silent and ultimately rather boring, so Saern passed the time by reviewing his small prayer book. It was a slender thing, the draconic faiths did not go in for high ceremonial volume, but the words operated on many levels, so it could be reread almost endlessly. </p>

<p>	Without warning the ship’s motion slowed, and Atactect called out. “Ready yourself priest, we are not alone out here.”</p>

<p>	Saern was on his feet in a flash, hand reaching for the morningstar he wore at his belt. “I don’t see anything,” he commented a moment later. The words sounded stupid the moment they left his mouth, for visibility in the thick fog was miniscule, and no doubt the wizard, using his ship, could observe much further. </p>

<p>	“I do not either,” Atactect’s voice held an uncertain menace. “But one of my wards was tripped, and by coincidence we have just passed through an area with heavy magical residue. Someone has been passing through this place regularly, and in the Ethereal that draws attention.”</p>

<p>	“What kind of attention?” Saern drew his morningstar, and drew away from the railing of the vessel. He had a selection of spells ready in his mind.</p>

<p>	“I am uncertain, but I imagine it will become clear very soon,” the wizard had his hands raised. </p>

<p>	The words proved prophetic.</p>

<p>	Moments later a beast looking to Saern’s eyes like some hideous cross between a very large bird and an insect launched itself out of the mists to land upon the deck, narrowly missing them. Instinctively he scrambled backward and away, noting the long tearing claws on the front pair of limbs and the sizeable maw surrounded by four clacking mandibles. Purple-toned armor plates guarded all surfaces, and a pair of flat pink eyes stared between the two.</p>

<p>	Atactect stood motionless, while Saern scurried back, clanking in his plate mail on the metal deck. Choosing the cleric, the creature charged. </p>

<p>	“Ethereal Slayer,” the black-robed wizard’s voice held no tension at all. “Fast and sure, but not strong.”</p>

<p>	The beast demonstrated that a moment later, lunging at Saern with both claws leading.</p>

<p>	The priest was faster than most men in full plate, his enchanted boots gave him a quick striding step, but he was not as fast as this beast, and it slid a claw under the edge of his armor at the waist, drawing a nasty cut. He only barely managed to push back the other with his shield. This left nothing to stop the mandibles, and they clamped down for a moment upon his elbow before he tore away.</p>

<p>	Atactect’s words were well chosen, however, for the cut was not deep and the mandibles did not do much more than bruise against the solid armor. “It is an animal, hurt it and it will flee,” Atactect pronounced.</p>

<p>	“Sure,” Saern grunted, circling around the creature and attempting to land a blow where it would matter. His morning star had a bit of enchantment, and his gauntlets augmented his strength, but he did not think it sufficient to penetrate the chitinous armor of this creature unaided. He focused instead on warding off those blows.</p>

<p>	The slayer attacked, clawing and biting, but Saern held fast with his shield, attempting only to defend, and struck back at those claws with the spiked head of his morning star. The creature failed to find purchase and ran past, trying to circle round.</p>

<p>	“Any help captain?” the cleric demanded, even as he stole his best chance and called upon Io’s favor for a spell. Energy poured into his body, filling him with the strength of a great beast, the spell known for that reason as Bull’s Strength among sages. </p>

<p>	Again the slayer charged, and once more Saern held his ground, though he took another glancing gash, this one behind the knee, he needed the captain to give him some opening, a way to take a solid strike at the head or joints, surely the weak points. </p>

<p>	“It is resistant to spellcasting, direct attacks are of little use, but,” Atactect spat a series of words in a strange tongue. </p>

<p>	A half-globe of darkness materialized out of the deck and enveloped the slayer, leaving the priest clear.</p>

<p>	Saern reacted instantly, anticipating what the creature would do.</p>

<p>	He guess was correct, and it barreled free of the blackness in a direct line to Atactect.</p>

<p>	Knowing this was his best chance, Saern called on additional support. “Swallower of Shades lend your servant a portion of your power!” He shouted the prayer in draconic as he brought the Morningstar down with all his strength, feeling the power of his god flow into him as he did so, redoubling the potency of his arm.</p>

<p>	The spiked steel ball struck the chitin armor plate above the skull with a tremendous crack, and the slayer stumbled, fell, and slammed bodily into the railing. Not wasting time Saern followed, noting immediately it was injured but not dead.</p>

<p>	He struck the back hip hard as the beast rose, barely dodging back in time to avoid a ruthless counterstroke from those long scythe-like claws.</p>

<p>	Gritting his teeth the cleric prepared to trade blows, but the slayer immediately spun itself over the side of the ship, leaving the effect of gravity Atactect’s vessel provided, and then, just avoiding a follow-through from the morningstar, shimmered and vanished before his eyes. </p>

<p>	It had plane shifted away.</p>

<p>	“Well done priest,” Atactect called, and <span style="font-style:italic">Composite Caravel</span> shifted swiftly into motion again, putting distance between them and the site of the brief battle. “I am glad you were aboard, or this could have been troublesome.</p>

<p>	“I was just protecting myself, thanks,” Saern did not believe the wizard’s words at all. He was sure Atactect could have easily defeated the Ethereal Slayer without any help, but had simply wished to avoid revealing the extent of his powers to his passenger. No wizard capable of controlling a vessel of this magnitude was limited to summoning globes of darkness in battle. “But since you think that way, perhaps a discount on the fare?”</p>

<p>	The wizard actually laughed, a terribly cold unnatural sound, not like a normal man’s laughter at all. It made Saern look at the black-robed man with frightful curiosity. What are you really? He wondered, and was uncertain he truly wished an answer. </p>

<p>	“I suppose I should expect the priest of a dragon god to be covetous of all wealth,” the wizard chuckled. “Very well, I shall reduce the travel fee by twenty-five gold pieces.”</p>

<p>	“Done,” the cleric had not expected any such generosity on the captain’s part; he’d take this much readily. Then, knowing it was best not put off, he turned away to face into the mists and called upon Io’s power to heal his wounds, feeling the energy knit flesh and restore blood with the quickness only the divine was able to accomplish. In moments if was as if he had not suffered any injury at all. </p>

<p>	Without glancing back at the wizard, Saern moved to the bow of <span style="font-style:italic">Composite Caravel</span> and took up a watch. He wanted to be better prepared for any additional surprises. </p>

<p>	He need not have bothered, the rest of the journey was without interruption, and he got something of a headache from starting at the endless mists without any stimuli. This was sufficiently distracting that he failed to notice the gradual thinning of the mist until they were directly atop their destination. </p>

<p>	Then he was staring into an astonishing sight as the mists pealed back to allow something like normal vision. A great island of white-blue material, flat on the top and extending into many ragged taping columns on the bottom, as if it were a cavern ceiling, floated there, all told the size a modest town. A small town was indeed present on one side, while well tended crop fields dotted the other, near a lovely waterfall unlike anything Saern had ever seen. It dropped away into the mists, an unfettered fluid form of impossible, ever-shifting grace. An impressive palatial building with many spires, Saern thought he recognized hints of djinn architecture but it was truly a mix well beyond his knowledge, dominated the view. He knew it must be the Etherfarer society Motherhouse from the description he’d once heard of Farer’s Freehold. Looking at it in person he was forced to adjust his estimations of the Etherfarer society. No simple planewalker’s club could create such an establishment; there was an organization with real power and likely authority here. If the vision’s suggestion that he take a ship had been intended to bring him here, Saern could only give thanks to the Ninefold Dragon for divine foresight. Surely he could find whatever he needed to complete the journey in this place. </p>

<p>	“We’re making for the Landing,” Atactect said, deadpan, apparently he was either familiar with this place or simply impossible to impress. It was obvious the point he mentioned was a long spar extending some distance out from the main landscape of the Freehold. “The Freehold has gravity, just like this vessel, so there should be no difficulties.”</p>

<p>	There was not, <span style="font-style:italic">Composite Caravel</span> pulled alongside and stopped. </p>

<p>	Eager to be off, Saern pulled out his purse from beneath his armor and carefully counted out a cluster of small gemstones and coins to match the three hundred and twenty-five pieces of gold he owed. It was a steep price, but thankfully the church in Slaan had given him some funds for this expedition. Considering his lack of familiarity with the Ethereal, the priest was glad to have come this far with sound transport. He would be able to learn what he needed to know before traveling further. </p>

<p>	Atactect took the payment and gave it only the most cursory of glances, apparently trusting the Church of Io would not skimp on the exchange. “Our business is concluded then,” the black-robed captain said quickly. “I have cargo to unload, and I suggest you make for the Hostelry. The Etherfarers will ask your business, but I doubt you have any worries in that regard.”</p>

<p>	“Indeed,” Saern replied, more than willing to leave the strange ship immediately. “I am grateful to finish this portion of my journey. Farewell for now, know that the Swallow of Shades watches always,” he spoke the ritual words and then marched down the gangplank without anything further.</p>

<p>	Atactect said nothing in reply. </p>

<p>	The rest went at the captain had said. An Etherfarer official stopped Saern and asked his name, and business, and then waved him on when he learned he was a priest of Io seeking out a demiplane. The meeting was a chance for the cleric to chance his first glimpse of the Nathri, the small greenish humanoids native to the Ethereal, up close. He’d seen them before in some of the great Inner Planar cities, but they seemed far more aware, energetic, and dangerous here. They also reminded him of Slaan’s kobold sneak-thieves, and he made a note to keep a very careful watch over his money.</p>

<p>	When they released him he headed on to the Hostelry, real rest would be welcome, and inns were always good places to start.</p>

1.	Atactect’s method of planar travel is something like a controlled form of a Planar Breach as described in the Planar Handbook. </p>

<p>2.	The Ethereal Slayer is described in Monster Manual III.</p>
