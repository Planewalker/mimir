        <div class="dice_rolls">
</div> <p>Although this will lead to a lengthy post, I want to go into my starting position regarding the Beastlands: the plane was obviously inspired by the beliefs of the peoples of North America. Unfortunately, this leads to the typical problems caused when someone writes about a culture outside their typical area of knowledge. In this case, <br />
1) Native American cultures get lumped together even though they are very distinct (i.e. while there are some common themes, the beliefs of people of the Pacific coast are different from those of the Lakota of the plains which are different the Ten Tribes of the east, etc. – by comparison, imagine if the Greek, Celtic, Norse, etc. got lumped together as the “European pantheon” and treated interchangably) <br />
2) Native American cultures suffer from writers inadvertently introducing subtly racist/prejudice terms/ideas due to their ignorance. (For example, the original name of the plane in the 1st edition was the un-PC “Happy Hunting Grounds” – I’m fairly certain Gygax and the TSR staff weren’t trying to be offensive). And on this front, I apologize in advance if I unintentionally do the same. (While my knowledge of North American folklore and religion is better than the average person on the street, I acknowledge that I am far from being an expert – in fact, I can think of at least two posters on this site that are far more knowledgeable)<br />
3) Native American peoples suffer from outside cultures projecting roles upon them. For many years, Native Americans were treated in popular culture as animals/pests/boogeymen that threatened or hampered “Manifest Destiny” and the westward spread of “culture”. Then for a while, there was an over-compensation counter-movement where all Native Americans were depicted as embodiments of mystical powers. While I find this preferable to the former depiction, it still treats the people as characters in roles largely of our creation instead of treating them as…well, as people</p>

<p>For these reasons, I would suggest that we start this project by divorcing the Native American elements as much as we practically can. I’m not saying that we shouldn’t re-incorporate them later. I definitely think the Native American cultures should be represented in the Beastlands. I am merely suggesting that instead of getting bogged down in and arguing about the factual details about Native American cultures and life; we should start with bigger themes about the Beastlands represent on a philosophical level(s) then once we have that in place, we go back and bring in the concrete details from historical fact and from personal invention.</p>

<p>My philosophical starting point for this plane was inspired by Rousseau’s romantic concept of the “Noble Savage” (hence my lengthy text above – so please treat this a philosophical idea not as my belief that this represents anyone in the real world)<br />
Rousseau saw the stifling/corrupting nature of the civilizations of Europe and felt that we had lost touch with our natural state which he considered pure. So following this theme, I pictured the Beastlands as a land that embodied a more moral form of the Cypher credo. It is a place where a person can shake off all the rules and expectations that we feel we have to live with and become more naturally attuned to his or her “true nature”. Sure the recent arrivals might over-compensate, throw off their clothes and run wild; but the long-term visitor will eventually clear his or her mind of all pre-conceptions and just feel in balance with themselves and with the surrounding environment. The visitor initially revel in his or her new-found freedom (and behave a bit chaotically) but as he or she achieves peace-of-mind, the visitor will behave more neutrally neither needing nor despising rules to know what is the “right” and moral way to behave towards others. This doesn’t mean that a native of the plane can’t be a brutal combatant; it just means he or she would not be motivated to violence from such petty considerations like greed or ambition. <br />
Residents consider all brothers and sisters. They value health, frugality, liberty, and vigor of body and mind: the love of virtue, the fear of the gods, a natural goodness toward their neighbors, attachment to their friends (including animal brethren), fidelity to all the world, moderation in prosperity, fortitude in adversity, courage always bold to speak the truth, and abhorrence of flattery.<br />
(I also contrasted this to Gehenna which I pictured as place where cruel organizations and mob mentality caused a disintegration of personal moral responsibility – but that’s for that separate thread)<br />
I’ll tie back to the themes of nature that most people associate this plane later.<br />
Another feature of this plane that most others seem to like but which I feel could use some tweaking are the three layers. I don’t have my notes handy so I’ll just call them Day, Night and Twilight (no sparkly vampires, please!) To me, having a whole layer that is defined as “always in dusk” doesn’t inspire much in my mind. As a counter argument, I would suggest that the three layers correspond to three vast categorizations that Nature plays in our minds. </p>

<p>For lack of better description, think of these layers as the subconscious, the conscious and the spiritual:<br />
-Imagine one layer that embodies the most savage aspects of nature. This isn’t evil but it’s definitely a struggle. This is the place where the visiting big-game hunters go to prove their mettle (but it’s also the place that kills the greater number of the visitors.) This is the layer there always seems to be a potential threat if one is weak or inattentive. This is the realm of drums pounding in the night that frightens the timid or excites one’s passions and sense of adventure.<br />
-The middle layer is more peaceful. And while there are a few Eden-ish spots of complete tranquility, the laws of natural survival are in place in the vast majority of the land. However, this is the place where animals and humans (and others) act and behave as equals. One can hunt (as needed) without the animals objecting (provided that the humans don’t object when the animals hunt them in turn). The bear that hunted you one day might debate philosophy with you the next day (after he’s eaten). It also the place where animal characters (e.g. the cast of Aesop’s Fables, Puss-In-Boots or Reynard the Fox) can be found <br />
-The “uppermost” layer is the home of powerful archetypal animals and forces of nature.  Aside from the animal gods (Raven, Coyote, etc.) this is the home of animals/animal spirits that almost on par with the demon lords (i.e. not gods, but definitely not beings to be trifled with). As an example, the Thunderbirds or THE Phoenix might be residents of this layer.</p>

<p>As a potential conflict within the plane, you could have disputes between the “soft” natives (i.e. those who live peaceful quiet lives) versus the “hard” natives (i.e. those that seek to strengthen themselves via a warrior ethic) - the “hard” natives might think they are performing a benevolent act by trying to “toughen up” their rivals by trying to lure away their youths and/or introducing threats (although the warriors always stand within distance to save their rivals if they prove completely incapable of the challenge presented)<br />
Some other conflicts might involve conflicts between the locals and visitors who cause problems with the mental baggage they bring (e.g. “If we drained this swamp, we could build a nice settlement here” or “If we kill all of the bears in the wild, we will prove ourselves as brave hunters and provide a service to these primitives”) You could even have a conflict between the locals and visitors who think they “grok” the Beastlands (imagine the most obnoxious, condescending hippies coming in and telling the locals what it “really” means to be in tune with nature)</p>

<p>Side note: I’ve included the shifters of Eberron as natives of this plane which I tie into people developing animal characteristics as they stay on this plane. I also ruled that lycanthropy is easier to cure on this plane than elsewhere in the multiverse (although shaking off the animal features might still be tough) to give my PCs a motivation to visit</p>

<p>-Potential adventure ideas: <br />
-A fiend has infiltrated the plane and is corrupting the natives resulting in a “Lord of the Flies” scenario<br />
-King Spider asks for the PCs help to stop the drow from stealing/corrupting his subjects (I think I stole this one from someone, so my apologies if it was you)</p>

<p>I know these ideas won’t be to everyone’s tastes but it’s my potential starting point. You can shoot down my points, but if you do, I insist that you offer an alternative in place of what you tear down.</p>       </div>

         <p>Good post, Palomides. </p>

<p>I hope someone will update the Native American Pantheons. I know it's challenging; I updated the Finnish Pantheon and I hope I was respectful. The best representation that I've seen is in Legends &amp; Lore.</p>

<p>I look forward to your ideas on the beastlands. I like your 3 layers.</p>

<p>Note: What is Dark to usis not at alll dark to many animals. Some can see into parts of the light spectrum that we can not.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Good stuff. At the moment I don't have much:</p>

<p>I see the Beastlands as representing Innocence, tying into the pure state you were talking about. Part of this Innocence, and why it takes the form of the animal predator-prey cycle, is there are times when innocents are drawn into conflicts. Child soldiers, people raised by racist parents, etc. </p>

<p>To some extent these people are responsible for their actions at least when they become adults, but there is a certain amount of innocence there IMO.</p>

<p>There is also the reality that even in a Good Multiverse, there will be heartbreak and anger and confusion that comes from free will. There are also honorable combat and ceremonial conflicts that could result in death and suffering. </p>

<p>The unintentional, unavoidable, and done-without-malice harm I associate with the Beastlands.</p>

<p>I like your description of the three layers. I do think for some people - not necessarily those from tribal cultures - the Beastlands is the perfect paradise. Some people do enjoy the struggle against odds - why we also have Bytopia. Celestials here could actually play games with petitioners and willing PCs, contests where angels hunt them down for sport.</p>

<p>Naturally, no one should be permanently killed by this game.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I've never liked how static the plane's layers were.  No creature really exists in eternal daylight or darkness.  For me, above and beyond any philosophical connections, I'd want visitors to have to chase the layers down.  Day passes into twilight passes into night passes into twilight passes into day again.  If the PCs want to remain on the daylight layer, they would have to constantly be on the move, chasing the day down.  Likewise with the nighttime layer.  Twilight would be the most elusive, since it would be so easy to slip into daylight or night.</p>

<p>Beyond that, I'd also like for sometimes the Sun to get eclipsed by the Moon. The entire plane would then shift into Twilight for a time.  Plus, there's a number of hunter/prey mythological relationships between the sun and moon and it makes sense for the plane to embody that sort of relationship.</p>

<p>Keying off the categorization that Palomides suggested, Night would be subconscious.  Darkness conceals and the anonymity it allows means that people can drop their masks and be who they truly are.  Daylight would be the conscious, a time when nothing is concealed or hidden.  Twilight is the border, when things shift from one state to another and creatures that normally wouldn't encounter one another may do so.  This odd balance, as well as its elusive nature, plays well into making it a Spiritual layer.</p>

<p>The other thing that I feel wasn't particularly well addressed in canon was the nature of the seasons on the plane.  I really feel like the Beastlands are the place where seasons should play an incredibly important role.  Animals migrate based on the seasons so why isn't there any sort of greater mention of their nature in the books?  It's an area I'd like see expanded upon.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Wicke, I agree with you that the overly static nature of the "nature" of the plane was something I found dull too (which is why I threw out an alternative). But to play devil's advocate, one could argue that since this is an afterlife, it needn't go through the normal cycles of life. The Order of the Stick web comic had a great strip where the protagonist looses track of time while he is playing with his long-dead little brother. When he is amazed, it is pointed out to him that if one never gets hungry or tired in the afterlife, it's easy to get wrapped up in happiness and forget about the passage of time. </p>

<p>But IMO, if the planes of goodness are just sitting around plucking ripe fruit that springs up in front of you when desired and always being in the perfect picnic weather, it makes things pretty boring. </p>

<p>If we follow your suggestion and the Beastlands do have seasons, I would say that the winters should be extremely mild in terms of survival.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I must admit that I'm a little disappointed (or at least impatient). I was expecting (or hoping) that there would be a lot more interest in this thread. </p>

<p>The Beastlands were one of the planes that intrigues me and seems to have some great hidden potential. But somehow, it always seemed to a bit off or underutilized; but the more I tried to take a hard look at it; the more I had to admit that I didn't have anything to add that would give the plane the "punch" that I felt that it should have. I don't know if others aren't chiming in for the same reason or if they just don't feel the plane needs a renovation (or if they avoid any thread with my name on it). <br />
Bottom line: I'm hungry for ideas for the Beastlands, so even if the ideas you have aren't ones you are using, I'd still like to hear them.</p>

<p>OK, going back to the template I suggested elsewhere, let's see what else I can add:<br />
*Unique overall theme - I suggested the theme of the "noble savage" (keeping in mind that this is a romantic/philosophical ideal, not a depiction of real people) and an alternative/related theme of innocence was suggested.</p>

<p>*Conflict within the plane - I didn't offer much but this is an Upper plane</p>

<p>*Unique terrain - this is one aspect that I didn't feel needed renovation. The plane seems to encompass any natural terrain (although I haven't seen any specific mention of frozen tundra/tiaga). I don't know if this is "unique" but I have no problem with it</p>

<p>*Unique representative species (prefereably one that embodies one or more themes of the plane) - This one is a problem for me. Talking animals and cloud beings (mortai) aren't enough for me. But, I'll at a loss for something new. <br />
I suggested people that shifted into (non-evil) lycanthrope forms like the shifters of Eberron when they hunt; but that's not much of a suggestion. <br />
Anyone have any ideas for non-unique residents (e.g. not Raven or Coyote)? </p>

<p>*Reason(s) for PCs to visit - Because this is a plane of Good and is one that I find interesting; I wasn't too worried about being able to lure my PCs there; but I'm still interested in suggestions</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

          Re: Planar Renovation Project - the Beastlands        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>I'm hesitant to consider the Beastlands more lawful than Arborea or Ysgard, which are, after all, populated by human cultures with organized laws and things like languages and counting.  A substantial "renovation" might be to place the Beastlands as the Good plane nearest Limbo, moving the democracy-founding, mathematics-inventing Greeks to the plane nearest Elysium (more closely aligning Olympus with the Greek-derived Elysium/Hades axis, after all) and putting Ysgard at the CG pole (along with the elves, since the alfar derive from Norse myth after all).  This is easy to justify: the Beastlands are the most primitive place of unspoiled nature, the perfect wilderness with the least intrusion by humankind.  Instead of "The Happy Hunting Grounds," its alternate names would be Eden, Paradise, or other names for the unfallen world that existed before sin, in religions that have such concepts.  It is Creation as the Creator(s) meant it to be, arising from the Good side of Limbo.</p>

<p>Such a plane would be boundlessly fertile and creative, with an abundance of good foods and waters for all kinds of natural creatures.  It might be rich with manna, even in the form of prey creatures that submit meekly to being eaten, with every native soul instinctively able to recognize what is "real" food and what would not be good to hunt (other souls not satisfying hunger).  (This makes interlopers a worrisome arrival, since they're likely to tromp around harming natives rather than eating the manna-creatures!)  Alternatively -- or perhaps in different areas, corresponding to religions that have a different concept of paradise -- the lion lays down with the lamb and neither experience hunger, only play and love and other such instinctive pleasures.</p>

<p>Many religions -- and Believers of the Source -- often think of animals as beings in a stage of reincarnations earlier or lower than humans.  In regions where this state holds, animals would expect to eventually pass through some sort of death, whether by being hunted or otherwise, so that they could return to life in a new form.  Animals here might remember being in multiple forms, even previous human lives, albeit vaguely.</p>

<p>Seasons and day/night cycles don't bother me terribly on a very chaotic plane.  In Paradise, it might just be whatever season or time of day most of the animals nearby want it to be.</p>

<p>It's possible that such a plane would hold various versions of different worlds' Garden of Eden inside it, which would be a very holy place of significance to major religions.  Manna constructs could be valuable.  This might also be the place to go for special familiars.  Occasionally, incursions from Limbo might cause trouble for which offworlders could be of use.  In addition to serving as the afterlife of animals, the plane might yield to an explorer some notions of animal and plant kinds that have yet to arise on the mortal worlds.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>If you're looking for a native race, I might suggest something akin to the Adu'ja from Dragon #317.  These look like they're from somebody's campaign information, but they gets the concept across well: </p>

<p><a href="http://eldarr.com/Eldarr/Aduja%20Culture.htm" title="http://eldarr.com/Eldarr/Aduja%20Culture.htm">http://eldarr.com/Eldarr/Aduja%20Culture.htm</a>  
<a href="http://realmofadventure.wikia.com/wiki/Adu%E2%80%99Jas" title="http://realmofadventure.wikia.com/wiki/Adu%E2%80%99Jas">http://realmofadventure.wikia.com/wiki/Adu%E2%80%99Jas</a></p>

<p>The upshot is that they're a reclusive and philosophical plant-based people who are said to inhabit the deepest parts of virgin forests.  They naturally take on a role of guardians of nature and disdain technology of any sort (to the point of destroying anything technological they come across).  </p>

<p>This, of course, suggests another theme for the plane: Nature vs technology.  Even something as simple as lighting a fire might draw the ire of nature loving natives.  Figures like Prometheus might be reviled on this plane, since they're the ones who originally gave the original spark to humanity (and by extension, all other sentients) and thus started them on the course of civilization.  This contrasts well with Bytopia, where it seems like technology and industry is welcomed and encouraged.  Likewise it seems like it would contrast with Gehenna where nature nature would be exploited, poisoned and used up.  </p>

<p>For any ruins that show up on the plane, you could evoke some of the quality of this tension by finding natives purposely deconstructing those places.  I could see magics being used to un-carve rocks, to regrow cut timbers and boards, and just about anything that purposely reverts the trappings of civilization.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Jem- Not to be too negative, but while I would be willing to make spots within the Beastlands Eden-esque; I fear that if we push this theme too far for the entire plane, then it might become a horribly dull place in terms of adventuring. Admittedly, Eden is supposed to have two angels with swords of flame defending it to keep the children of Adam from getting back in and corrupting the place; but if the main conflict is even getting to the place, I fear that that may be too limited. (Feel free to argue the point if I'm over-simplifing your suggestion.)</p>

<p>Wicke- <br />
I definitely think the adu'ja would make a good addition to this plane. Extrapolating from some ideas I had for a race of plant-men. There might be several strata/castes/plant types in their society. In mine I had:<br />
-Central plants/trees that were the true creative forces within these communities. (I guess you could think of them as benevolent versions of the mind flayers brain tanks). Most visitors would be oblivious as to their role and power with the community, instead thinking that they were just pretty, well-cared for plants<br />
-A number of plant-men (like the adu'ja) who were mobile and carried on a lot of the daily tasks of the community as well as communicating with visitors<br />
-A number of plant creatures (often modeled after efficient examples in the animal kingdom) that serve specific roles. The most prominent of these would be a race of thorn-covered warrriors who protect the community. But other examples might be a cheetah-esque sentient plant that can race between locations to deliver messages, etc. </p>

<p>It funny that you bring up Prometheus at the same time that Jem is pushing elements of Eden. I say this as I always saw a parallel (with vastly different interpretations) between the story of Prometheus and that of the Serpent in Eden. In both stories Man is living in simple conditions when the "Meddler" (Prometheus or the Serpent) causes Man to gain "knowledge" (in one case by giving fire, symbolic of higher reasoning and the ability to manipulate his environment, versus eating of the Tree of Knowledge). <br />
But the morals of the stories are opposites: Prometheus is heralded for giving humanity the means to live above a brutish existance while the Serpent is reviled for tricking us into giving up our childlike existance under the grace of God.<br />
In both stories, I see the metaphor of moving from a state moral unconsciousness similar to childhood (with themes of helplessness in one case and themes of blissful simplicity and being protected and loved in the other) and moving into the liberation and burden of being an adult responcible for his own choices.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>If the Outer Planes are the manifestations of belief, then The Beastlands would represent the beliefs of primitive cultures.  Or rather, those cultures that haven't developed a strong concept of the divine.  Instead of personifying a deity in the form of an figure, these cultures instead see the natural world as being infused with a divine/vital essence.  Animism.  Everything else about the plane flows out from that.  </p>

<p>Also, since The Beastlands aren't an axial plane, they don't really need a strong race to represent them.  So I'd rather utilize a race that's kami-like than something that has a high hierarchical structure.  That is, rather than a cast a single race as the "Beastlands race", the entire plane would have the potential to manifest itself in the form of some essence of nature.  This is already sort of present in the form of the Mortai, but it could easily be extended to entities like dryads or spirits of the land or similar manifestations of nature.  </p>

<p>My thoughts keep taking me back to Spirited Away and the bathhouse, where the animal spirits go about performing very human-like tasks and jobs.  That suggests a few questions to me: Do any of the animals continue to mimic human society?  If they do, what sorts of ventures are likely to be present?  Bathhouses? Tea shops?  Inns and wayhouses?  It's certainly a different way of looking at plane.  </p>

<p>In a similar vein, we could draw on Princess Mononoke and the corrupted guardians, which suggest a strong nature vs. technology theme, something that was mentioned earlier.  Even in Spirited Away, when the polluted river spirit came to have a bath, it only became pure again once the garbage and debris was removed, going from a state out of balance to one that's in balance.</p>

<p>I'm sure there are many other examples looking at that nature-out-of-balance theme.  Maybe there's something there that we could draw on to fuel our thoughts about the plane?  Honestly, I'm just going to start tossing out ideas and seeing if I can spark anything for the rest of you good folks.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Yeah, I'm looking strictly at the difference between, say monotheistic cultures and cultures that hold closer to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animism" class="bb-url">animism</a>.  The latter is something the feels closer to what would/should be found on the Beastlands.  As such, the plane seems like it should be home to myriad minor divinities.</p>

<p>That suggests to me that throughout the Beastlands, you might find quintessential landscapes.  A hill that represents all hills, a river that represents all rivers.  Maybe that's a bit far reaching, but I hope you can see what I'm driving at.  </p>

<p>Where on Prime worlds, people might talk about the spirit of the river, on the Beastlands, you could converse with such a spirit.  You're also likely to come across characters like Jack Frost or the Old Man In The Mountain or other similar embodiments of the natural world.  Like I said, the land should be alive.</p>

<p>I like it.  Conjures up images of the polluted river spirit that came to the bathhouse.  Such a race might even arise on the Beastlands themselves through the innocent but destructive actions of non-natives.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>In terms of a force that is injecting "technology", why do you see this coming from? Modrons from Mechanus?

<p>I suppose it would come down to asking about what sorts of resources the Beastlands might have that either couldn't be found elsewhere or could be found there easier.  I'm inclined to keep the cross-planar interactions mostly centered around the mirror planes.  Bytopia, Carceri and Gehenna.  Beyond that, I'm not sure.  I'll have to give it some thought.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Is the Beastlands the plane where Good simply is a part of Being? As in, it is divorced from notions of guilt and sin, encompassing a Paradise dedicated to Valor and Endurance?</p>

Like many of your posts, I find this evocative but I'm not certain I understand what you are driving at (not intended as a slam on you).
Do you see the Beastlands as a gathering place for those souls that died standing by their moral convictions without compromising to subtle deceiving arguments or bowing to force from evil rulers?
And/or do you see them as sending agents to mortals in situations like this in order to bolter their resolve? 
And/or do you view the plane as generating threats/evils that test the resolves of the good within the plane in order to test them or to make them morally stronger?</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>sciborg2</em> wrote:</div>Is the plane a representation of Tolerance, its thick wilds home to many risen fiends?</div>
Are you suggesting that the residents are so laid back that they are OK with fiends (until, I'm assuming, the fiends start harming others)? I don't want to shoot down any ideas at this point; but I'm not sure what you are envisioning</p>

<p>In an effort to revitalize this thread (no offense intended to those who have contributed so far), maybe we should start start looking at things at a slightly lower level.<br />
So what do you see the residents of this plane doing most of the time? E.g. On Celestia, there is the drive to climb the mountain; on Baator, there are the Byzantine plotting; etc. So what do you think occupies the people of the Beastlands? Aside from hunting (and avoiding being hunted)?</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>heh, your trouble with understanding my posts is likely due to their stream of consciousness wackiness.</p>

<p>What I meant by metaphorical space is that the Beastlands is the incarnation of mortal struggle to maintain virtue in the face of a harsh world. So long as no one outside the Beastlands - save perhaps for celestials wise to its environs - enters this is fine. However, visitors might be surprised by the savage wilderness of the plane.</p>

<p>I wasn't thinking of it as laid back exactly, just dedicated to Goodness as a state of Being. So risen fiends who come here just want to exist as Good entities, perhaps vigilantes that enter Sigil or the mortal world to fight crime. They want to be Good, but they want to earn redemption on their terms, perhaps due to a continued mistrust of celestials.</p>

<p>I guess I see the Beastlands as a sort of Gnostic awareness of Good, the Multiverse striving, on the level of its collective mental space, towards the better essence of its nature. So it tolerates Evil that is reaching toward the Good, but this Evil is processed via the savage yet Edenic Innocence of the plane....</p>

<p>Not sure if I'm explaining this right...</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>I'd imagine that most fiends who end up on the Beastlands end up transforming into nasty predators, as per the plane's shtick of handing out animal features to visitors.  It's probably one of the ways the plane defends itself: just fold any hostiles into the natural balance of the plane.  </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>So what do you see the residents of this plane doing most of the time? E.g.

<p>Exploring that drive for each plane may actually be worth an entire thread by itself.</p>

<p>As for what occupies the people of the Beastlands...a question occurs to me: Are the petitioners of the Beastlands strictly just the animals, or are there communities of non-animal petitioners?  I mean, animals are going to be doing animal things, which usually isn't a whole lot beyond eating, sleeping and pursuing mates.  So by itself, the animal-petitioner paradigm doesn't really lend itself to much interest. </p>

<p>Nomadic groups provide for more interest, since they'll actually have some sort of culture to interact with.  They'd also be involved in the hunt, whether small groups pursuing game or gathering food from the local plant-life, or larger groups that track and follow the migration of herd animals.  They'd likely split their time between the hunt/foraging during the daylight hours, and drum/dance circles, group storytelling or even just stargazing during the nighttime hours.</p>

<p>The avariel (winged elves) are also natives of the plane iirc, so that gives us another native race to consider.  I don't know much about them other than their love of flying.  Also including a race like the Adu'ja would also provide something more for any visitors to interact with.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>So you're seeing the plane creating/directing "white blood cells" to attack the "germs" (i.e. the less than good visitors) that infest it's "body"? That is a somewhat interesting picture to me. <br />
Does this imply that someone pure of heart would only find gentle creatures that nuzzle up to them to get a scratch behind the ear; while someone pretty vile would be targetted by the most viscious of creatures?</p>

<p>Or as Wicke suggests, does a being visiting the plane get changed into an animal form based on his nature? Would the innocent remain mostly unchanged in form but the most wicked transform the most (physically and mentally) into wild beasts? <br />
If so, this might tie into a motivation for the residents. Perhaps the live to take down these most wild animals. A new savage beast is roaming the woods (i.e. a transformed fiend recently arrived)? Then let's form a hunting party and track it down.  We'll enjoy a good hunt AND further the cause of goodness. <br />
(Of course, this raises the question to me of how transformed does a visitor have to be before he literally becomes "fair game" for the hunt?)</p>

I agree with you that there should be non-animal petitioners. And if we follow the logic above, the most human of the petitioners are the ones that arrived most in-tune with the plane to begin with. Others with some bestial traits are still trying to work out the "impurities" in their own souls</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Another question I find myself asking is, why would anybody go to the Beastlands beyond the desire to hunt?  The best answer I've come up with, and it touches on sciborg2's spirit journey comment: The Beastlands is the plane of omens.  That ability to read the environment for cues about what the future holds.  The sighting of a raven signaling trouble.  A flight of doves signifying a positive event.  An inopportune rainfall signifying the downfall of a great leader.  I could easily see a reclusive hermit/holy person living  in the thick of the plane, interpreting the signs and gaining an understanding into the goings on of the multiverse.  That by itself, the pursuit of insight or information into something that might otherwise remain dark, would make the Beastlands a worthwhile place to visit.</p>

<p>Also, the more I consider it, the more I suspect that the seasons and the day/night cycle are malleable based on whatever mental/spiritual state a person or group is in.  Winters and summers would be as mild or as bitter/hot as an individual's spiritual natures dictated.  Tribal groups pursuing the hunt and whose lives are closely tied to the seasons would find they would continue moving in sync with the seasons and day/night.  Animal petitioners would likely find themselves living in perpetual daylight or night, depending on their nature.  Somebody in an altered state spiritual journey would find the environment changing according to whatever they and their beliefs dictated.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>sciborg2</em> wrote:</div>What I meant by metaphorical space is that the Beastlands is the incarnation of mortal struggle to maintain virtue in the face of a harsh world. So long as no one outside the Beastlands - save perhaps for celestials wise to its environs - enters this is fine. However, visitors might be surprised by the savage wilderness of the plane.</div></p>

<p>I don't think the plane would be specifically savage.  I think it would come down to the individuals, like I mentioned above.  Those who go in to the plane expecting savagery will likely find savagery.  Those who go in expecting gentleness, will find gentleness.  Those who go in with no expectations will likely get a  full range of experiences.  And, if you know what you're doing, you can interpret what you come across and maybe gain some insight into something that you've been seeking.</p>

<p>Fiends going into the plane might be there to pursue that insight, but expect the plane to resist their efforts.  In holding that expectation though, they actually create it.  And the plane is more than willing/happy to indulge them.  They would find a steady stream of petitioners, animal or otherwise, looking for a fight or a way of testing themselves.  There are tales of individuals on a spiritual journeys to the other world that encounter fiendish creatures and end up taking them down in some glorious spiritual metaphor.  That sort of thing probably happens semi-regularly on the Beastlands.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>In light of Palomides' rubric for renovating a plane:</p>

<p>*Unique overall theme(s) - savagery and innocence, nature vs. civilization, living in harmony with nature vs. creating a world of your own choosing</p>

<p>DESIRABLE<br />
 *Conflict within the plane - vs. the animals, navigating the social mores of the more tribal/nomadic petitioners, simple survival<br />
*Unique terrain - I like the idea of having a shifting day/night cycle as well as having the shifting seasons.  It helps to cast the Beastlands in a more chaotic light, rather than having the hard edged "This is the daylight layer, this is the twilight layer, and this is the nighttime layer".  The terrain may morph to be whatever is needed/desired by whomever is close-by<br />
 *At least one unique representative species (prefereably one that embodies one or more themes of the plane) - still hashing this one out, I think.  We have some good ideas, but they really need to be developed further.<br />
 *Reason(s) for PCs to visit - I mentioned the omens thing.  I could also see this becoming a plane where a person goes to be cleansed spiritually in a sort of "return to the beginning" sense.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>So, Bytopia as a plane is partially focused on cottage industries and the manufacture of goods for sale.  It's a place where raw materials are turned into useful things.  In contrast, I see the Beastlands as a place where raw materials are used directly.  The land provides everything that a person could hope to need to survive and no more. </p>

<p>Also, I suspect that trade is virtually unheard of on the plane.  Everything is given and taken freely "for the Land provides all".  That in turn could lead to some interesting moments when outsiders start interacting with the natives.  It could be that before anything gets shared, one must prove themselves or some such.</p>

<p>So you're seeing the plane creating/directing "white blood cells" to attack the "germs" (i.e. the less than good visitors) that infest it's "body"? That is a somewhat interesting picture to me. <br />
Does this imply that someone pure of heart would only find gentle creatures that nuzzle up to them to get a scratch behind the ear; while someone pretty vile would be targetted by the most viscious of creatures?</p>

<p>Or as Wicke suggests, does a being visiting the plane get changed into an animal form based on his nature? Would the innocent remain mostly unchanged in form but the most wicked transform the most (physically and mentally) into wild beasts? <br />
If so, this might tie into a motivation for the residents. Perhaps the live to take down these most wild animals. A new savage beast is roaming the woods (i.e. a transformed fiend recently arrived)? Then let's form a hunting party and track it down.  We'll enjoy a good hunt AND further the cause of goodness. <br />
(Of course, this raises the question to me of how transformed does a visitor have to be before he literally becomes "fair game" for the hunt?)<br />
</div></p>

<p>I actually was trying to get across something that might be sorta out there: </p>

<p>That the Outer Planes are Platonic representations for spiritual states (which in this case is a struggle) and/or incarnations of such states occurring in the Multiverse. So the Beastlands is an incarnation of the struggle for virtue, as is Bytopia. But the latter is about the struggle toward the good via societies whereas the Beastlands represents that struggle in varied individuals. Hence it's being tinged with a bit of Chaos.</p>

<p>This is why an Upper Plane can be so wild and dangerous. It isn't a Paradise, or a "Heaven", but the Goodness of it allows it and the other Upper Planes to be considered as such.</p>

<p>That said, I'm a bit wary of tying in Innocence to remaining, for an easy term, "human". I do think that evil beings should perhaps feel consumed, possibly transformed, and thrown into perilous situations, but these tribulations should ideally - in conjunction with the excellent subjective foreshadowing and omen ideas - provide a picaresque that ideally changes an evil being's soul.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I`d certainly see Hengeyokai and Shifters (as noted above) as some of the possible natives of this plane.  Hengeyokai would be animal spirits who took on Human qualities, while the first Shifters would be Humans who became more like animal spirits.  Though some Shifters may just be Guardinal-bloodline Aasimar, instead.</p>

<p>One of my favourite subjects in D&amp;D has often been the Yuan-Ti, where in my ideas there`s many different sects of Yuan-Ti, while many of them are evil, there are in fact good sects of Yuan-Ti (beyond the Shulassakar Couatl cult).  I`ve generally seen them as a bunch of Naga cultists who started since the Eon of Wyrms.  A Beastland sect of Yuan-Ti are perhaps followers of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucalinda" class="bb-url">Mucalinda</a> the Protector.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>What about the Beastland Sky and Underdark? Not to mention it's oceans, and potential landscape of things like giant mushroom forests and massive honeycombs.</p>

<p>There should, IMO, also be a fey presence as well as some understanding about how the celestial races work with the animal lords and possibly even the mortai.</p>

          Re: Planar Renovation Project - the Beastlands        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>I’ve always had kind of a problem with how the chaotic Upper Planes are organized.  Of the three, the Beastlands, Arborea, and Ysgard, which is the most chaotic, and which is the most good? I’d say Arborea and Ysgard are both equally chaotic, and depending on how one wants to argue, the Beastlands might be even more chaotic (no cities, no laws), or not chaotic at all (acting on instinct is true neutral). None of the three seems especially good-- I mean, they’re not evil, but they’re not capital-G Good in the way that the other Upper Planes are good, or good to the degree which the Lower Planes are evil. I like Arborea and Ysgard, and I like the concept of the Beastlands, but I feel like all three were kind of shoehorned into the Great Wheel.</p>

<p>Which might be rather appropriate, actually.</p>

<p>When I think of Sylvania, I think of taverns and gardens, parks and manors, orchards and barns, all sprawling through the woods, rambling along the roads of the Outlands, running through, to use the popular jargon, unincorporated townships and satellite farming communities-- little villages that think of themselves as just another neighbourhood in Greater Sylvania. Faunel’s a ruin, and Glorium’s barely more than a lighthouse for the ships bound to and from Ysgard-- they’re places for people passing through, or places for people who want to stop living like people. The lands around are fertile and populous, and no one worries about borders drawn on a map, about sitting on the shiniest throne in the tallest tower with the sturdiest walls.</p>

<p>I’m rambling, but the idea which is occurring to me is that the chaotic good planes might actually be well on their way to uniting. The borders have always been blurry-- some of the old maps take it for granted that a party will walk from Arvandor through Tir Na nOg onto Brux and then back into Arborea, because that’s the shortest route. Maybe, some say, the borders never used to exist at all, and it’s the imposition of Law that created these divisions, long ago. As the planes begin to overlap, perhaps it’s a sign that freedom and equality are gaining ground across the multiverse.</p>

<p>Of course, fundamentally altering the nature of the Great Wheel was never going to sit well with everyone, particularly the powers of Law. It’s bad enough that Ysgard is already riddled with conduits to the Inner Planes, that you can dive off earthmotes in certain parts of the plane and splash into the mire of Limbo. It’s probably always annoyed the archons, the way that the elves, the eladrin, have freely mingled among the mortals of the Prime. More unsettling, however, is the recent manner in which the Beastlands’ border with Elysium has started to….relax. Ferocious wild beasts roaming the land of eternal rest? The powers and their petitioners are not pleased. So far, it’s only been a few isolated incidents. So far.</p>

<p>The guardinals, naturally, are up in arms. Not least out of concern that their secrets on Elysium’s sealed bottom layer of Belierin might be discovered.</p>

<p>… </p>

<p>Speaking of guardinals, as a planar race for the Beastlands, the animal-headed celestials might work well as a stopgap measure. They’re not native, and they don’t really fit the plane’s ethos… which is just the kind of awkward fit that I feel is characteristic of Planescape. Besides, the Beastlands have a unique petitioner ‘race’, as do Ysgard and Acheron. Although admittedly Ysgard also has einheriar, the giants, and (to a degree) bariaurs, and Acheron has goblins, orcs, and bladelings. Still, hengeyokai and shifters are a good start.</p>

<p>Anyway, the guardinals could still be an interesting addition. They might claim that they’re present on Beastlands to protect it. The local petitioners didn’t ask for Elysium’s help, and they don’t want it. The guardinals contend that they aren’t colonizing or occupying the Beastlands, that they don’t want to alter its character or make it more like Elysium-- that they are only concerned that someone else will. They’re here to observe, to keep watch, nothing more.</p>

<p>There’d be a rumour making the rounds in Sigil, that the guardinals are trying to gain a foothold in another plane, pursuing power and territory in order to achieve a level of symmetry in their ideological cold war with the yugoloths.  Many people assume out of hand that this rumour was started by the yugoloths, but no one is really sure.</p>

<p>This is a relatively minor conflict, but importantly, it’s an interplanar conflict, and that’s something I think was missing from most of the planes that were in need of renovation. It’s also a conflict between good and good, and in this case neutral good and neutral good. We don’t really see enough of those. There are reasons why the archons and the eladrin don’t get along. Mythologically speaking, asuras and devas absolutely despise each other. Guardinals should be something more than just animal-people with good intentions, but like their diametric opposition the yugoloths, I feel like their approach to promoting good should be indirect.  If the yugoloths are unctuous facilitators who are thoroughly untrustworthy, the guardinals are overbearing meddlers who can be relied upon absolutely. They’ll do the right thing, and they’ll get you to do the right thing, whether you want to or not. And that’s probably the comfort zone for a lot of Beastlands petitioners. They’ll do the right thing… eventually. Given extensive prodding. Or the right push.</p>

<p>Guardinal scouts and spies might be the early warning system that gets outsiders (adventurers, archons, et cetera) involved in matters that might not otherwise concern them, or remote squabbles on distant parts of the planes that they’d otherwise have no way of knowing about.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>That’s a lot of talk about other planes for a thread that’s about the Beastlands, isn’t it? But I feel like that’s where a lot of the planes’ definition comes from, in terms of what they oppose, what they stand against. Baator is evocative owing to the sheer weight of lore it can draw upon, but it’s also interesting as an inverted column of fallen angels, led by the best of them, now staffing a war machine with the damned to hold back an endless tide of chaos. Elysium holds all that is good in the world; the Gray Waste withers for the lack of it. Mechanus and Limbo are so foreign to one another that they can barely interact. But what about the Beastlands? Gehenna might be an appalling, unlivable wasteland, and maybe an industrialized yugoloth army (the Crawling City, anyone?) could provide a good counterpoint to life as nature intended it. But I really feel like it could be the Abyss that is most threatening to all that the Beastlands stand for.</p>

<p>The Abyss could draw more substantially on real-world demon lore than it does, but I think as written it goes out of its way to show how anything can be corrupted, to show evil and chaos endless in its variety, creatures which eschew morals and lack even an instinctive knowledge of the natural order.  A demon can’t be sated. It doesn’t fight for territory or a mate. Indeed, what it hungers for is the fight itself, and it takes mates and conquers territory to fight, and ultimately destroy all that it can possess.</p>

<p>And maybe that’s why the tanar’ri are the worst threat to the Beastlands. The Beastlands don’t have anything that the baatezu or yugoloth particularly want, and to most of other planes, they’re virtually uninhabited, but to the tanar’ri, they’re just a well-stocked pantry.</p>

<p>It could be that the Beastlands lack any natural defense against creatures from the Abyss. I have this pet theory that, while incursions from the Far Realm are so abominable that reality itself rebels against them and expels/repels the invaders, demons are not, per se, unnatural. Rather, they are living creatures, twisted in mind and body by magic and simple suffering. They are supernaturally evil, yes, but they are still flesh and spirit bound together, without the flicker of fallen divinity that marks most other fiends (except yugoloths, but they probably bear some traces of necromancy and arcane artifice around their husks).</p>

<p>Demons are not so readily banished on a plane where primal magic, rather than divine, rules the day. For that matter, if summoning spells only summon creatures from elsewhere on the Beastlands, maybe demons are only banished elsewhere on the plane as well. And I could see how turning a demon into Somebody Else’s Problem wouldn’t really be acceptable to the plane’s goodhearted petitioners.</p>

<p>So when a demon rampages through the wilderness of the Beastlands, it’s a matter of grave significance, and frequently many animal petitioners’ lives will be spent in slaying the threat, unless it should happen to stray into the realm of a god. </p>

<p>Yes, this is partly inspired by Princess Mononoke. Admittedly, possession by liquefied demodands is closer to the source, as you've said, but I feel like the demodands themselves are motivated by a certain pettiness. The demons are closer to nature, and because of that, a greater perversion of it.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>Part of me feels like humanoids don’t really belong in the Beastlands. Those that live here might live as hermits, or at most as couples or small family groups, never anything big enough to constitute a tribe, not all in one place. I know some already exist, canonically (Signpost, Triberove), but in the grand scheme of the Beastlands, these are passing oddities. I do like the idea of talking plants, however. Not treants, although there could be some of those, but trees and stones and clouds and waves, given voice by the plane itself. There are no real cities on the Beastlands (just small towns, and damn few, including the realms of the Beastland powers), but it can be one of the most crowded of planes, once provoked.</p>

<p>The sites listed in Planes of Conflict seem like they could have been on any plane. I’d kind of like to see some more sites and characters who could only really exist in the Beastlands. I’m still pondering right now, although in the interests of generating further conflicts for the Beastlands, I had an idea for a wolf petitioner who’s assembling an empire of wolves, a Pack of Packs, in the northern tundra. No weapons, no fortifications, just numbers and chutzpah, using the same charisma and tactical genius that served him in life. This really rubs some of the Animal Lords the wrong way. The Wolf Emperor isn’t doing anything outright evil, but he’s not acting like a wolf.</p>

<p>Is there a description of Coyote and Raven’s realms anywhere?</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>This probably belongs more in the Gehenna thread, but in the spirit of planar renovation, I have another motive for wanting the guardinals on the Beastlands: in my campaign, rakshasa are the native race of Gehenna. Their holdings in Acheron have, over time, slid into Baator or the Outlands, and were then brought into Gehenna (my version of Gehenna consists of the four mounts, but also contains far more moons, cloud cities built atop the smoke and steam of the volcanic vents, and sundry orbiting dreck). I digress. Arcanoloths/raavasta are closely related to rakshasa, and may in fact be different only in name and allegiance. The rakshasa and raavasta species, then, bears some mysterious relationship with the guardinals. It might be coincidence that they both share animalistic features, as many Prime world races do, but why never the same animals (your campaign may vary)? The rakshasa's casual reliance on lies and illusion, the surprising secrecy of the guardinals, and the deep-rooted hatred of both for the arcanoloths... What does it add up to?</p>

<p>It could be nothing. Or...</p>

<p>The rakshasa despise their cousins the raavasta for one reason in particular: they have given up their souls to become yugoloths, and in so doing they have removed themselves from the cycle of reincarnation which is central to rakshasa culture. It is almost inconceivable to the rakshasa that anyone would give up their immortality in this way. It is worse than murder, indeed, far worse to the casually murderous rakshasa, as life is cheap but souls indescribably precious and irreplacable. The arcanoloths have destroyed all their past selves and future incarnations, and for what? They have handed the keys to Gehenna to the mercenaries of Hades and given up eternity for nothing better than a chance to serve as bureaucrats for the insects.</p>

<p>Likewise, then, could it be that the rakshasa hate the guardinals for similar reasons? Are the guardinals rakshasa who have redeemed themselves, propelling them into the ranks of the celestials? Is that their secret, which they have somehow hidden from the multiverse at large? Is guardinal zeal simply a desperate bid to make up for past sins?</p>

<p>In any event, with callous exploitation being a theme of Gehenna, I picture the rakshasa holding the pursestrings of the yugoloths. They despise them utterly, but to profit from them is a better revenge than fruitless war (this is why I moved them off of Acheron). Rakshasa are the bankers and corporate shareholders of the war, the profiteers of the Blood War. They have ravaged Gehenna to the point where it is a polluted desolate debris field stripped of life and resources by ancient industry, sustained by exports brought in from offworld, and only made bearable by illusion.</p>

<p>Where is all this heading? I had an idea that the guardinals do have an ulterior motive for being on the Beastlands. They usually do-- they have a real Talisid-knows-best attitude in general. They want to sow new life in the barren portions of the Great Wheel, seeds and saplings sprung in the Beastlands. Most celestial seeds could not survive in evil climes, and would be too obvious even if they did take root, but the Beastlands are more neutral than good, more spiritual than celestial. Perhaps they could be grown in secret, creating bastions of good (or at least a lesser evil) in the Lower Planes, a small bulwark that could be defended until such a time as it might slide out of its plane altogether-- perhaps into the Outlands, but hopefully, all the way into the Beastlands.</p>

<p>The guardinals have studied the example of Menausus, knowing full well that what they intend will be far more difficult. They are also examining the rakshasa's theft of their cubes in Acheron.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Well Unsung, you are a man (or woman) after my own heart. And you raised some interesting ideas (IMO). <br />
First, if you are interested, there are a number of planar renovation projects, such as Gehenna<br />
<a href="forum/planar-renovation-project-gehenna_.html" title="/forum/planar-renovation-project-gehenna">/forum/planar-renovation-project-gehenna</a><br />
(except for the exclusion of Ysgard which comes with a pretty well-known mythology most of the Outer Planes covered have been the "alignment off" planes - Beastlands, Bytopia, Arcadia, Acheron, Gehenna, Carceri, Pandemonium)</p>

<p>Second, I have also been inspired (to some degree) to contrast opposing planar races:<br />
-In my home-brew re-arrangement of the planes, I made a specific plane/location opposite Mt. Celestia that was largely populated with vrocks as I thought these vulture-esque fiends seemed like a dark reflection of the winged angels. <br />
-I populated Acheron with a few more giants and Norse "villains" than typical to serve as a contrast to the Viking warriors of Ysgard<br />
-I pitted a plane/location of the tiger-headed (in standard DnD if not in legend) rakshasa against the animal spirits of the plane/location of the Chinese Bureaucracy (although I could easily see shifting this to stand opposite the Beastlands)<br />
So I am personally digging the yugoloth vs. Beastland residents theme you have suggested</p>

<p>Third this is probably a topic for another thread (if not done already), but I also endorse, not a rearrangement but, alternative interpretations of "the Wheel". While "the Wheel" is the most popular interpretation I think there should be people with different ideas of how the planes are arrange. And I think all of these should be equally valid (or invalid)<br />
Personally, I envision a Rubik's Cube arrangement of the planes that works.<br />
Another arrangement I've thought of is that the "axial" planes (Elysium, Grey Wastes, Limbo, Mechanus) is the "center" of the surrounding planes (for example, imagine the Grey Wastes as being a central battlefield with Baator and the Abyss as "kingdoms" on opposite sides of this wasteland.<br />
Another possibility (given the theme of balancing diametrically opposite planes) would be as a mobile with several beams (with the opposing planes on each end) that twist and bob and occasionally brush up against the other "beams"<br />
Except for the rules about spell loss as priests move to "more distant" planes, I think all of these theories could be viable and have strong followings  <br />
So to me, the idea of planes merging and splintering raises some exciting possibilities (albeit, probably for another thread)</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>I've never really found a third axis for the Outer Planes that I really liked. All the good ones seem to be handled: law-chaos-good-evil in the Outer Planes, life-death-and-the-four-elements in the Inner Planes, and the Prime Material sandwiched between the two to act as an axis for mind-matter-synthesis.</p>

<p>Anyway, the rest of this post is going to contain some screwy, academically unsound conjecture, based purely on what I think makes for a good story. Disclaimer over.</p>

<p>There’s some parallel mythology at work with the trickster spirits of the Beastlands which I find especially interesting. In a tale of Coyote, the trickster impersonates the creator, and makes mankind out of clay. One story of Raven has him stealing fire from the gods and giving it to mortals. The theft of fire and the creation of man are of course the famous accomplishments attributed to Prometheus, the friendly titan-- who, it is not well-known, had a brother called Epimetheus (“afterthought”, literally ‘after-thinker’). Bear with me, now.  Prometheus (“foresight”) was supposedly a great genius; Epimetheus was a fool. Meanwhile, both Raven and Coyote can be enormously clever-- and at the same time, their own schemes often get the better of them. As befitting of benefactors to mankind, they are fallible, capable of good and evil.</p>

<p>I’m not saying that the titans and the tricksters are one and the same-- not exactly. That’s for you and your campaign to decide. It could very well be the case. What I *am* saying is that cycles and archetypes are the building blocks of the Outer Planes, and as the Rule of Three dictates, if it can happen once, it might happen again, but if it happens twice, everyone needs to be on the lookout for the third time. I suppose we’re also talking about the Unity of Rings, now, as well.</p>

<p>Maybe Raven and Coyote predate the cosmos as we know it, and the titan siblings were merely unwittingly playing out their version of the legend. Maybe Raven and Coyote stole Prometheus’s thunder (and fire), independently or in cahoots, on burgeoning prime worlds outside the original titans’ influence. It’s almost impossible to say, because on the Outer Planes, time is relative and belief informs reality, and everything is subject to the gods’ whims. History really is written by the victors, not to mention the Dungeon Master. For my own part, I like the idea of different beliefs creating different gods, even molding new avatars out of the Elder, so to speak. </p>

<p>One possible role for the Beastlands is as a storehouse for archetypes-- not just the Animal Lords, but the definitive article (self-proclaimed, anyway) of everything that can be found in nature, using the premise of the Beastlands as the First World.  Some simply have less power, because while all animals instinctively emulate their Animal Lord patron (cats for the Cat Lord, corvids for Raven-- skulls for the skull throne…), sapient creatures are much more fractious. A Dwarf Lord or Elf Lord is almost possible, and indeed, Moradin and Corellon might have arisen as just that; a Human Lord or Tiefling Lord is a concept not easily imagined, not consistently.</p>

<p>Those who suspect the truth, that the Beastlands are the mold for countless worlds, would be understandably protective of it. I would be inclined to move Gaia here from the Outlands (I tend to view the Outlands as the ultimate crossroads, a place whose neutrality is tension in all directions,  a place that exists out of the needs of others rather than being the source of anything).  And if the Beastlands are a living thing, I might simply have them be Gaia herself, with conflict arising from the presence of all her children squabbling around and on top of her, even as she suffers constant entreaties and interruptions from distant relations seeking her wisdom.</p>

<p>...<br />
 <br />
More free-association based on multiple interpretations of different myths:</p>

<p>Raven stole fire from the Sky-Father; Prometheus stole fire from Zeus. Admittedly, Prometheus did it out of concern for the people he’d created, while Raven gave fire to the world more or less by accident. But what if the Sky-Father Raven stole fire from is Uranus, or some other primordial sky-being who fathered multiple subsequent pantheons? Uranus was the father of the Titans, and was usurped by his son Cronus; likewise, Cronus’s son overthrows his father, only to withhold fire from the world, like Uranus before him.</p>

<p>One possible moral to take away from this: there are certain things which cannot be owned-- they belong to everybody. That might be a theme of the Beastlands, and part of what makes them more chaotic: the idea that while there is a natural order, a right thing to do, ownership is a lie, or maybe just a sin. You can possess a thing, you can inhabit a place, but they have a spirit of their own. If you don’t need something, you shouldn’t hold onto it. There’s altruism, up to a point, but there’s also a desire to be left alone. Creatures don’t come into this world owing anybody anything.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>In another case of parallel mythology (you might have to squint a little), Zeus gave Pandora her famous box, and sent her down to meet all the little people Prometheus had created. In some tellings, it was Epimetheus who decided that they should open the box, in spite of knowing who sent it, and over his brother’s protests.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, way back when, the Great Spirit handed out gifts to all the First People in cedar boxes, each of which contained the makings of a world: water, mountains, wind, seeds. The First People were archetypal animals (the first Animal Lords?), and a covetous Seagull kept his box, which held all the light in the world, all to himself.  The world lay in darkness until Raven was asked to intervene, in his own special way. Raven, unable to cajole, flatter, or bluff Seagull into giving up the box, wished for a thorn to appear in the other bird’s path. It did. Then, in the guise of offering to help remove the thorn, Raven took the opportunity to push the thorn deeper and deeper into Seagull’s foot until, crying out in pain, Seagull dropped the box, and out popped the moon and sun.</p>

<p>So Raven, acting out of his own interests, gives the world light. Epimetheus, with the best of intentions, unleashes darkness on the multiverse.  The multiverse is full of little ironies. The moral I leave up to you.</p>

<p>If the Beastlands were the First World, then there could well be a lot of history here that not many people know, or which they try to hide. Maybe sun gods like Ra, Pelor, and Amaunator like to claim that history and existence emanate out from them, but it’s actually a failing, and they simply refuse to believe in a state of existence without time or light or life; without the sun gods themselves, in other words.</p>

<p>And maybe the story of Pandora’s box is a cyclical tale about the release of evil into the world. There could have been another cedar box, this one containing famine and pestilence and war-- the first daemons, the yugoloths. They might have been invisible spirits then, the first disease, or they might have been a cloud of locusts, the first vermin. Whatever they were, the Beastlands would be that part of the First World which was preserved against the spread of the original evil-- the first quarantine. Perhaps the box of evil was a box that was never intended to be opened, or else a trick played by the baernoloths, creation’s first biological weapon. Or, and I rather like this idea, the joke was on the baernoloths as well: back before good and evil, when there was only order and chaos, there was a box, metaphorical or otherwise, left over from a previous creation. The race that would become the baernoloths discovered it, and were infected by evil. To a race which had no concept of evil, the spread of evil might act very much like a disease.</p>

<p>We’re getting into chicken-and-egg territory, again. Ah, the unity of rings…</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

For example, I placed Ysgard (seeking to control one's fate) on the consciousness side and place Pandemonium (madness) on the side of unconsciousness.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Say, that's... awfully high praise, Wicke, Palomides, thanks. This thread was one I just had to post on, because the Beastlands are so rich with potential, but so sadly underused. </p>

<p>The subconscious and the hyperconscious? Interesting... My immediate thoughts are something of a tangent: this, more than any other axis, is personal to every being, an ongoing scuffle between Id and Superego. Each man and woman is in fact an island, containing a unique psychic landscape which can be explored, and adventured within, like any of the planes. The realm of Dreams is only one part of what makes up a mortal mind. You see this conflict mirrored in the planes themselves, more subtly: the good planes ascend to ever-greater heights of goodness, the evil planes delved downward into ever-deepening layers of evil, but Mechanus and Limbo don't have clearly layers, at least not ones that are clearly marked. Mechanus has no depth, Limbo has no surface or sky-- no impulse and no conscience, respectively. On Elysium and Hades, things are balanced: the sense of community and contentedness on Elysium, the lack of either desire or acceptance on Hades. The rilmani actually seem liked they'd work very well as the creatures at the top of this axis. They're determined to know everything and ensure people play their proper parts (even if those parts are evil or chaotic). I don't know what's on the other side of the spectrum, but it lurks underneath the spire (maybe it's Ilsensine, and we unknowingly do its bidding even as we scurry about like cranium rats, satisfying our baser urges).</p>

<p>Past-future-present would be another good axis, which could also be centred on the Outlands. On the one side, the defunct future in which the illithids arose. On the other, the distant past remembered by the LeShay, obyriths, possibly the aboleths and ethergaunts. Both eras are so alien, to each other as well as the current multiverse, that the concepts of law, chaos, good, and evil do not apply, at least not in any capacity which we'd readily comprehend.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Mine was Static versus Active: I never used it in a game, but I suggested it a couple of different ways on the boards here.  You still have good, evil, law and chaos, but the inhabitants differ on whether these goals are to be pursued through vigorous activity, or merely exemplified as part of their inevitability.</p>

<p>You could split some of the interstitial planes by layers.  For instance, Pandemonium splits into Chaotic Neutral Active and Chaotic Neutral Static, with the upper two windy layers becoming Active and the lower two labyrinthine and imprisonment layers becoming Static; the upper two are madness as howling wildness, while the lower two are chaos as formless entropy and absence of purpose.  Acheron splits into Lawful Evil Active (first and third layers), representing imperial aggression in its most violent form, and Lawful Evil Static (second and fourth), representing tyranny at its most iron-fisted absolute.  Et cetera around the planes.</p>

<p>Another way to go is simply to rearrange planes; have the Beastlands be Good Neutral Static, nature unformed and pristine, the edenic paradise, while Bytopia becomes Good Neutral Active, the plane of purpose and craftsmanship, etc.  This way requires two new planes; you could either promote the Positive and Negative to the status of moral planes at the Active and Static poles, or you could produce new planes of Yin and Yang, or the Primum Mobile and Nirvana.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Should've said something about this earlier, but there's something about this direction I like, Jem. In particular, having planes of Yin and Yang is a great idea. I think I'm going to think about this some more, then try and shift this discussion to sciborg's information elemental page, since I think it could be very helpful there.</p>

<p>Also, another site for the Beastlands: a huge elephant graveyard which shifts from one layer to the next every few months. The place is full of very old petitioners and elephant ancestor spirits. And elephants never forget, right?</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>In a different system I GMed (GURPS playing In Nomine), Grandmother Spider made an appearance.  She's the creator, or at least a leader of the pantheon, putting her at high divine rank.  The players were of a sufficient level to encounter her, and she put on the face of a friendly old woman doing her knitting.</p>

<p>It just happened that the knitting was attached to a web that flung out behind her into a scale model of the universe, with a strong impression that it was the real thing, or at least a very good divination tool...</p>

<p>Spiders in D&amp;D supplements tend to be evil, so it could be interesting to have an enormous spiderweb populated with good spider creatures.  You could find wisdom written in curious runes in the intricate cobwebs of animal spirits that make their lair in Grandmother's Web, divine future events from the pattern of the threads that touch worlds, or use the Web via incantations such as <span style="font-style:italic">Hrothgar's journey</span> as another portal hub to worlds where the pantheon is worshiped.  (Though of course one would need to be in good standing with the Amerind Pantheon, and would occasionally be sent places where you could do some useful work in payment for your journeys!)  The Web itself would probably appear to be suspended in space, with stars in the distance attached to strong threads to hand over the worlds.</p>

<p>Good giant spiders could make an interesting race of her people, although of course she would be said to have created humans as well.  (And a Medium giant spider with regular Int doesn't even seem like it would need more than maybe +1 LA over its base 2 HD!)  Her relations with other spider powers would be complex (a tangled web, so to speak...): Anansi seems more strictly chaotic, while of course her people would be staunch enemies of Lolth and other spider-fiends.  They probably don't like insectile fiends in general.  Her morality as a deity would surely be about keeping busy at honest labor, and appreciating artistry.  Her warriors would appreciate stealth and quick strikes, and would not regard poison as dishonorable; violence is terrible, and should be employed sparingly and swiftly.  Dishonor is in seeking wars you don't need.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Re Guardinals... its probably worth keeping in mind that the Beastlands Guardinals are quite different from the ones on the Blessed Fields.  The Book of Exalted Deeds establishes that Guardinals here are characteristically much more primal and animalistic, both in form and behavior. <br />
Beastlands Guardinals are mostly quadrupedal (except obviously the Avorals there), and are seemingly more like intelligent Celestial animals with magic powers.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>I don't know if it's just due to stereotypes/misinfo in the media, or a clash of themes, but it's hard for me to think of a good place for tricksters like Raven and Coyote as gods with realms and all that. </p>

<p>I sort of think they are immortals, incarnations of the Archetypes Unsung mentions, perhaps with less direct power than gods but also with an ability to travel to the Prime. Also, they may be easier to kill, but it's harder to make them stay dead. I suspect they also know things about the Multiverse that not even the gods are privy to.</p>

<p>In the same vein, I feel like the White Buffalo Woman would be a good fit for the Beastlands, but again I know so little of the actual mythology.</p>

<p>I have a book I'm reading called Native American Theology. I haven't gotten very far, but I may have more insights in a bit. I should also have a book on Native American Mythology, I'll have to dig it out.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>So yeah, pretty much what Sciborg said. I think there could be some entities, like Gaia, the Sky-Father, and the Animal Lords, who aren’t powers but are instead primeval archetypes. They don’t require belief to exist, and they can’t be permanently destroyed. They aren’t necessarily the creators themselves, but it’s in their image that the creatures of the multiverse were created. </p>

<p>Archetypes could be among the few beings that exist a priori, before creation, and in some cases before light, time, or the earth itself are supposed to have existed. In the Raven creation myths, he’s always finding things or stealing them, never making them. The Great Spirit doesn’t come down and make the world, but rather gives out boxes containing things that will be used to fill the world, but clearly there are already spirits dwelling in it already.</p>

<p>An idea I like is that the first god of the sun (cranky old Amaunator, giver of light, keeper of law, who I conflate with Amun/Aten/Ra), assuming in his arrogance that he was the first power to exist, demanded beginnings and endings to beings which had previously had none. He thus created mortality, old age, and linear time (none of which would apply to him), and then distanced himself from the ‘lesser beings’. He would later arrive in the part of the Outer Planes which would become Arcadia, where the extremely lawful Egyptian Pantheon sprung up around him, founding the great planar city of Heliopolis.</p>

<p>But what Ra might like us to forget is that he actually started out as Khepri, the Scarab Lord-- making him just a glorified dung beetle, in other words.</p>

<p>Or not. Not everyone will share my irreverence for Amaunator (poor Lathander…). Still, I like the idea of the Beastlands being this place where a lot of pantheons don’t talk about and don’t go-- since they usually haven’t in the published books, why not run with that and have there be a long-standing reason why?</p>

<p>Certainly there’s been ample awkwardness between the Olympians and the Beastlands. Gaia loves all her children, and can’t forgive Zeus for imprisoning the titans-- even after Cronus did the same to her other children. Athena is not well-liked by Anansi after what happened between the goddess and Arachne. Coyote has offended Artemis repeatedly with his lasciviousness.  In fact, the majority of pantheons are too civilized for the Beastlands just by virtue of being pantheons, and the Olympians really put civilization on a pedestal. The only Greek power who might be welcome on the Beastlands at all is probably Pan.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>So we could have multiple versions of the tricksters, trying to find a different one for each of the Native American Nations, but I kind of prefer the idea that the stories are all true, for a given definition of true, and the tricksters are just that flawed and changeable. Whether they are perceived as good or evil, clever or stupid, it’s all just perspective. So here’s my take on it:</p>

<p>The realms of the immortal tricksters tend to follow them as they wander. Raven and Coyote are forever trying to one-up each other, and their ongoing prank war has had thousands of years to escalate.  Their tricks can be deadly, to outsiders as well as themselves, though neither one ever stays dead for long. Outsiders who happen to stray into the crossfire are usually not so lucky-- though the adventurers may find themselves brought back to life by a curious Raven or a plotting Coyote. Fortunately their rivalry largely occupies them on the various layers of the Beastlands, usually only one during any given decade or so.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Raven (N).</span> A powerful shapeshifter, Raven nonetheless spends most of his time in the form of an ordinary, solitary black raven. In human form, even though he can look like anyone he likes, he rarely puts any effort into disguising himself, and he is often encountered in the shape of a small man who appears to be forever standing in shadows. On closer inspection, however, his clothes, his skin, his eyes, and even his teeth and tongue are simply black-- not an impressive, consuming black, either, but a drab, somewhat dirty black. As an animal lord, Raven doesn’t actively cultivate worship. He doesn’t have anyone to impress.</p>

<p>Despite his rather childish temperament, Raven actually possesses an intellect that is the envy of many gods, yet he is driven to only one end: a cure for boredom. Raven masters arcane magic with the greatest of ease, but soon forgets whatever spells he learns out of a lack of interest. Constantly stealing and conniving others out of however much or little they might possess, Raven has left a collection of magic items to rival the vaults of Baator, left scattered about the Beastlands in hollow logs and holes in the ground. He may know countless secrets of portals, planes, and powers, but cajoling him into remembering anything is another matter entirely.</p>

<p>Raven does have a soft spot for humans, particularly those descended from certain tribes, which he is able to sense upon meeting a person. He considers himself their patron, of sorts, having discovered them on the inside of a clamshell and a kyton (the mollusk, not the fiend) on the beach in the primordial epoch. They piqued his interest sufficiently that he eventually decided not to simply put them back in their respective shells, and have since colonized the multiverse. Raven likes to take credit for all that they’ve achieved since then.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Coyote (CN).</span> Coyote has many forms, though not so many as Raven. But where Coyote lacks the formidable magic of his rival, he makes up for it in an impressive physicality. His nose can scent through illusions, and his reflexes border on the precognitive. He is sneaky enough to hide in plain sight, or to vanish when one isn’t looking, and reappear in a place where he could not possibly be. Usually appearing as a dusty brown coyote, a strappingly handsome human man, or something between the two, vain Coyote likes to cut a dashing figure. Raven is quite cosmopolitan and may be seen outside the Beastlands. He dresses flatteringly, and pays attention to local fashions. While in human form, he often neglects to change his eyes, ears, and tail.</p>

<p>Charming, capricious, dramatic, fickle, and moody, Coyote is a study in contradictions. Everything is a joke to Coyote, but his comedy rarely translates well, skewing toward bizarre, abstract, vulgar, and occasionally gruesome subject matter. He can be sentimental and kind, even heroic when sufficiently moved by another’s plight. He can also be callous and cruel, sometimes without meaning to be, as he is single-minded in getting what he wants-- which changes constantly. He may burst out laughing at grievous insults, but react violently to imagined slights. He flirts outrageously, and declares his eternal love at the drop of a hat. He can be generous, but he also simply takes anything he wants. He offends the gods with his irreverence, but is incensed when others, mortal and immortal alike, do not show him the proper respect, and is subsequently annoyed when they are too formal.</p>

<p>Coyote doesn’t want followers to emulate him. He wants to be unique. He likes being the centre of attention, and he likes an appreciative audience who showers him with praise and presents, and who are maybe a little afraid of him. His blessing is sought by rogues, rangers, bards, and anyone else who relies on stealth or luck to succeed, as well as those who simply believe it is better to be on the safe side, and that it’s better to have Coyote on their side than the alternative.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I was trying to dig up a legend I knew. I thought it was from the Native Americans of the southwest or maybe Central America, but since I can't seem to dig it up I'm not sure anymore.</p>

<p>It involved the gods earlier attempts to create races to populate the world. Each attempt used a different material (stone, wood, etc.) but eventually each was found wanting and wiped out in a unique way (deluge, scorching the earth, etc.) until the current race of men was created (from corn if I remember correctly) but with the implication that the current race of man will be found wanting and wiped out in time.<br />
If we keep with the archetpye theme, there might be tribes of a small number of these earlier races (those that served as the template for the rest of the race) living in the Beastlands. The idea of the "ideal" representatives of a race that was found to be lacking seems like quite a tragic concept with these races living in the Beastlands just trying to make peace with "failing" the gods.</p>

<p>If anyone knows the legend I'm tangentianly referencing, I'd appreciate more details as it's driving me nuts that I can't remember</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

          Re: Planar Renovation Project - the Beastlands        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>That sounds like the Aztec creation myth of the Five Suns: Each of the five worlds was created by the four Tezcatlipocas, sons of the all-encompassing creator god Ometeotl, a god of opposites who was both male and female, light and darkness, evil and good, and so on. (I like the concept of Ometeotl-- I feel like there's some planar race dedicated to this kind of duality somewhere in D&amp;D, but I can't remember what they are.)</p>

<p>In the course of creating each world, a god (not necessarily one of the principal four) must be sacrificed to become the sun. As they are gods (or archetypal beings), they are not destroyed by the sacrifice, but transformed, transcended, which fits in with the whole storehouse-of-archetypes concept (as well as the Beastlands as a beginning point for cycles, if we go with that).</p>

<p>Inevitably, each world was destroyed by cataclysm, and the four gods create a new one. Supposedly, the world we live in is the Fifth and final Sun: one sun for each of the cardinal directions, and a fifth for the sacred Centre.</p>

<p>As a side note, before there was a sun, the gods united to war against the Earth Crocodile, Cipactli, a beast the size of a continent with a gaping maw at each of her joints. When she was killed (or at least subdued), she became the land, floating in the primordial waters. One thinks that this Earth Crocodile might be an archomental/primordial, animal lord, or both. I'm not sure if this made it into D&amp;D elsewhere, but I have this image of great gaping craters scattered throughout the Prime which are really the maws of the half-slumbering Cipactli.</p>

<p>The Aztecs equated the hungry earth with destruction and the grave. Earth gods in Aztec mythology tend to be among the most violent and bloodthirsty.</p>

<p>At any rate, here are the five Suns:</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Jaguar Sun-</span> An age of giants, whose Sun was the Black Tezcatlipoca (known simply as Tezcatlipoca), god of the North, of earth, night, and strife. This world was incomplete, an empty age of cold and darkness, either because of Tezcatlipoca's status as god of night or because he had lost a foot in the battle against the Earth Crocodile.</p>

<p>The Jaguar Sun ended after Quetzalcoatl, the White Tezcatlipoca, god of the West and of light and mercy, forcibly removed his brother from the sun, which plunged the world into utter darkness. Enraged, the Black took on the form of a great jaguar and destroyed the world-- or possibly commanded all the jaguars of the world to destroy it for him, depending on the telling.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Wind Sun-</span> The Sun of this age was the White Tezcatlipoca, Quetzalcoatl, also a god of wind and sorcery. It is described as an age in which the people grew distant from the gods and regressed to savagery. But it seems like there's room for a Tower of Babel story, here-- I seem to remember some mention of legendary cities lost to time in Aztec lore. So using Quetzalcoatl' gifts of sorcery, a mighty civilization rose, but in their hubris, the people grew to venerate reason, science, and arcane sorcery over the divine, all culminating in the destruction of their civilization and a brutal, postapocalyptic regression-- maybe sufficiently advanced magic/science along the lines of Oerth's Invoked Devastation and Rain of Colourless Fire, Expedition to Barrier Peaks, or maybe the fall of Atlantis.</p>

<p>The Wind Sun ended when the Black turned the faithless people of the world into monkeys (de-evolved them, maybe, if that's not getting too sci-fi). Quetzalcoatl, perhaps still fond of the flawed people even as they had turned away from him, sent his winds to scour the age clean-- whether out of disgust or pity, it's not necessarily clear.</p>

<p>Being turned into monkeys is loosely reminiscent of the survivors of Babel losing the ability to understand each other, too, which I like.</p>

<p>Incidentally, the other two Tezcatlipocas are Huitzilopochtli, the warlike Blue god of the South, and Xipe Totec, the Red god of death, rebirth, and the East. Huitzilopochtli is sometimes said to be the Fifth Sun, but it's not consistent.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Fire Sun-</span> The next Sun was Tlaloc, a powerful god of rain, fertility, and storms. He was seemingly a good choice, until the Black Tezcatlipoca stole and seduced his wife, the goddess of flowers. Shattered by grief, Tlaloc withheld his blessings from the world, resulting in an age of drought and famine. Tlaloc refuses to answer the people's prayers. None of the other gods, it seems, saw fit to intervene.</p>

<p>The Fire Sun ended when Tlaloc gave the people the rain they were clamouring for-- a rain of fire which reduced the world to a cinder. As Tlaloc was a god of storms, this might be as much a torrential downpour and series of lightning strikes that ignited wildfires throughout the parched earth. The few survivors of this world become birds-- perhaps sheltering in cities high in the upper atmosphere, built among clouds which are never allowed to rain.</p>

<p>The next age began when Tlaloc found a new wife, so perhaps the destruction of this sad, neglected world came about out of the inattentiveness of new love. Who knows?</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Water Sun-</span> Tlaloc's new wife, Chalchiuhtlicue, a mother goddess, becomes the new Sun. With a loving sun to watch over the world, this should be an age of peace and plenty. Unfortunately, it doesn't last. This is the world that ends in flood, as Chalchiuhtlicue is driven to tears, though the cause is uncertain: whether it was a wedge driven between her and Tlaloc, or some armour-piercing question posed by Tezcatlipoca, Chalchiuhtlicue weeps continuously throughout the age. The world fills with tears stained with the goddess's blood.</p>

<p>I'm picturing a world of shrinking islands, as the seas grow deeper and deeper over hundreds of years. The people of this world grow to see it as a prison, and consider it a blessing when they are transformed into fish when the Water Sun finally ends.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Fifth Sun-</span> The Earthquake Sun, and the present age. The Sun is humble, infirm god Nanahuatzin, while the Moon is Tlaloc and Chalchiuhtlicue's son Teccizetatl, who was not brave enough to enter the fires of sacrifice until Nanahuatzin led the way. The people of this age were created from the bones of the dead, stolen by Quetzalcoatl from the underworld of Mictlan-- possibly analogous to the current interchange of souls to and from the Outer Planes and the Prime Material.</p>

<p>It is foretold that this age is the last, and will end in earthquakes-- possibly as Cipactli wakes up, or maybe in vengeance from Mictlantecuhtli for Quetzalcoatl's theft of the dead. Meanwhile, the Aztecs' sacrifices of blood are intended to feed the sun with blood, as the sun's light is the only thing which can keep the end of the world at bay. War and sacrifice are a necessity, in service of a noble cause.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>I think the idea that the Aztec Pantheon discarded its experiments in the Beastlands is highly fitting. Creatures who venerated the gods, but were later abandoned, through no fault of their own? What better heaven than a pristine world where you were accepted, with no demands placed on you but to live humbly and well?</p>

<p>Also, does anyone else think the chichimec is a creature that really looks like something you'd fight on the Beastlands? Or during the Fire Sun. Interestingly, in an alternate version of the myth, Quetzalcoatl is born to Coatlicue after a ball of feathers 'falls on her' while she is sweeping out a temple. She subsequently gives birth to the Feathered Serpent. Later, when her elder daughter (the sorceress Coyolxauhqui) and sons ('the Four Hundred Stars/Southerners') become suspicious, they attempt to murder Coatlicue-- at which point she gives birth to Huitzilopochtli, who springs forth fully formed and in full armour (a la Athena), and kills them all.</p>

<p>If that wasn't awesome enough, Coatlicue also lives on after having her head cut off (or possibly just in half), whereupon the wound heals into two serpents.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>The idea of the flower wars, whether or not they were historical fact, are awesome fodder for Planescape. The idea that the Aztecs refrained from conquering enemy nations just so that they could continue fighting them and sacrificing them? Sounds very Acheronian to me. Imagine jaguar-headed rakshasa, leading legions petitioners in endless battle, worshipping Huitzilopochtli on a huge stone cube covered in stepped pyramids...</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>I'm not sure if much has been done offically with the Meso-American pantheons. There is an occasional reference to one god or another living on a given plane but with the exception of a brief encounter with one in one of the adventures in "Tales of the Outer Planes", I think that has been it. </p>

<p>I think this is due to the parallel issues of <br />
1) the Meso-American cultures not being as familiar to most people as the myths of Europe<br />
2) Maztica never really caught on. The gods they created had obvious parallels to the real world gods but Maztica didn't have a lot of interesting stories and legends created solely for them<br />
3) the concept (exagerated or not) of excessive blood sacrifices by the people of Central America. I'm not sure if most authors knew or felt comfortable placing them on the good or the evil sides of the Wheel (originally, they had a mirror version of the Outlands - which was actually somewhat appropriate given the prominence of twins in many of their legends)</p>

<p>Personally, I like the idea of putting one or more of the more brutal Aztec gods/mythic beings in Acheron (but's probably best put into the Acheron PRP - which we have out there)</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>I'd like to say that I didn't actually remember having read Ripvanwormer's previous mention of the Beastlands as the plane of archetypes, but I think I must have, so apologies and credit where it's due. Sorry. Um.</p>

<p>So... The sacrifices were usually supposed to be willing, or in the case of the Aztecs, were captive enemy warriors in their largest numbers.  It was supposed to be a great honour, carried out in emulation of the gods who sacrificed themselves to create and sustain the world. It was a purification rite that more or less guaranteed you a place of glory in the afterlife.</p>

<p>Whether or not the sacrifices were actually volunteers, and whether or not they actually felt honoured is another matter entirely. That could well have been the original intent, and the arrangement preferred by the pantheon. Not everyone will condone even a willing sacrifice, but it is not necessarily, by the standards of D&amp;D, evil. And if we, the players and DMs, have trouble reconciling the good intentions of the Aztecs (ensuring that the sun keeps shining, etc) with the brutality of their methods, then I imagine the inhabitants of the Upper Planes feel something similar.</p>

<p>I actually think that Tezcatlipoca could be a good fit on the Beastlands. Savage Black Tezcatlipoca of the North, god of night and trickery, patron of jaguars, first Sun of the world... Put him on Karasuthra, and I think he'd fit right in. Is he evil? Some people might think so, but the same could be said of Coyote or Raven, on a similar basis. I think to the Aztecs he was a necessary evil, gradually receiving all the blame that could be heaped upon him.</p>

<p>I interpret Set of the Egyptian pantheon, Loki of the Norse, and Hades of the Olympians as serving a similar purpose-- evil because someone has to be, and better the devil you know than the one you don't.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>While researching for a class I taught on Beninoi Voudon this week I came across this creature.<br />
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zangbeto" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zangbeto">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zangbeto</a></p>

<p>It struck me as being quite a good fit for an Exemplar of the Beastlands.  Zangbeto are ritual wardens, guardians and even hunters of wrongdoers in the Voudon religion.<br />
Their most mystic depiction is as primal spirits of nature possessing big shaggy hairy conical mounds of many bright colours.  The spirits are called into the big shaggy object using mystic ritual, and then the Zangbeto is released to dance and spin during Voudon ceremonies.  Some remain as permanent protectors of the village.</p>

<p>They struck me as a bit like a more primal and animalistic version of a golem - but with free-will and intelligence.  I could envisage nature spirits animating huge coloured bundles of hide and vines upon the Beastlands too, acting a bit like much smaller versions of Spirits of the Land.  Zangbeto somehow just feel like the right kind of weird for this plane...  I find the thought of a shambling, whirling horde of implacable Zangbetos spontaneously arising from the dream plants of the Beastlands and the hair and hide of fallen Celestial animals to be quite an evocative image of what might happen if someone started seriously rocking the boat here.  </p>

<p>There are plenty of independent free-willed denizens of the Beastlands, but if the Plane really wanted to defend itself against extraplanar incursions then in my mind at least, it wouldn't be Celestial animals and Petitioners that rose up in defense, so much as the fabric of the landscape itself forming into primitive mobile shapes to repel and overpower invaders - driven by the primal spirits of nature itself.  </p>

<p>I would probably base one statistically around a Celestial Shambling Mound to begin with, but give it some Fear and Enchantment abilities.  Arbitrarily I would expect them to have a CR of about 10.  They are probably gestalt entities too, in that several spirits inhabit each Zangbeto, and the Zangbetos are mystically bonded to one another.  They would probably therefore share senses like Formians and Parai do.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">
