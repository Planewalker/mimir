          On Fiends and Sympathy, a Literary Discussion        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
        <div class="dice_rolls">
</div> <p>There is a matter that I have been pondering lately. Given its direct relevance to Planescape, I thought I'd bring it here to see what you think.</p>

<p>How does one make a fiend a sympathetic literary character?  </p>

<p>I'm sure many of us have heard the idea that the best villains are the ones that believe they're trying to do right.  This holds true in many cases. However, it's also quite possible to have solid antagonists that really are bad people.  Most of these antagonists are already humanized or humanlike, though. Or they're specially crafted for the sake of the story they're in. They goals and motivations that readers can associate with and understand on the human level. The key to making a solid villain is giving your readers (or players) some way to associate with the villain, whether they're the "misguided good intentions" or the "really a bad guy" type.  </p>

<p>Can this be applied to fiends?  "Evil just to be evil" is often critiqued as a "bad" or "poorly developed" antagonist, yet that's just what a fiend is.  They are evil because that is simply what they <span style="font-style:italic">are</span>.  In the grand scheme of Planescape, this works.  But it doesn't prove as interesting on the micro level. So is there a way to make fiends sympathetic?</p>

<p>Certainly, some specific fiends are sympathetic characters.  Shemeshka and A'kin, for example, are characters that are much easier to associate with as a villain than simply "yugoloths" or even "arcanaloths." But I would argue that this is because they specifically try to associate with humanity. They have human sympathy because they deliberately interact on that level. Can the same be said for all fiends?  Can you take a random, arbitrarily chosen tanar'ri and spin his desires for chaos, slaughter, and destruction in such a way that the reader can associate with him?  Or do you have to leave his "chaotic evil" nature as a backdrop and develop his other aspects?  Can you spin the baatezu as a whole in a way that readers can better associate and understand them or should the treatment be reserved only for specific fiends?</p>

<p>These are just hypothetical examples, but literary critics are often right when they say that evil for evil's sake does not a good villain make. How would you work with your fiends, on the macro or micro level, to make them interesting, sympathetic villains?</p>       </div>

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><p>I agree with Azure in that fiends are Evil, and attempting to rationalize it is futile. They might have had a reason to be evil in life (abused as a child, fallen in the with the wrong crowd, lost a loved one, needed money, whatever), but it was still a choice that they made, and thus they ended up on the Lower Planes. Once they did, their petitioner had no recollection of the reasons for their choices, only the evil that resulted from them. The good in their souls slowly dissipated, and they became evil incarnate, fueled by more Evil. It's very unlikely that player characters would discover the person whose petitioner eventually scrambled to the top of the fiendish hierarchy to become their archenemy - that takes thousands of years and is rarely recorded. There's some rumors about Orcus' past, but that's all they are. However, despite the irredeemable nature of fiends whose Evil cannot be sympathized with or related to by even the vilest mortal, you can still make particular fiends interesting. I would argue that Shemeshka, to use your example, is interesting not because she is in any way less Evil or more rationalized in it than other Arcanaloths. Rather, she is interesting because of the very idiosyncratic details of her character, fully Evil as it is. A'kin, on the other hand, is interesting because he doesn't act traditionally Evil but nice, yet does not seem to be a raised fiend, creating a unique mystery. Using those two as examples, you could extrapolate to make any fiend completely and irrevocably Evil while still being an interesting nemesis through other means - character quirks, mystery, associations with others, goals, etc.</p></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

          Fiends are more forces of        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><p>Fiends are more forces of nature than they are characters I think. In some ways, it is better to think of them as an immovable force. Their nature is immutable, and like a hurricane they just do what they do. The difference is that they manifest a moral aspect rather than a natural one. Trying to make a fiend sympathetic is running contrary to what they represent. They are I think intentionally unsympathetic because they are the  manifestation of the extreme of a particular metaphysical ideal, thus they are inherently a bit one dimensional. It may be possible to make particular exceptions, alla Fall-From-Grace, but as a whole it's hard to imagine fiends as being simply "misunderstood" without rewriting their whole mythology (although personally I think there is a lot to be said for rewriting certain parts of Planescape mythology).</p><p>To bring this back to the "fiends as immovable force" thing, from a literary perspective, there have been plenty of stories written on the "Man versus Nature" conflict that are worthy of plenty of literary praise. I think the key here isn't necessarily reimagining fiends, it's re-thinking what is meaningful in that conflict. Man versus nature conflicts are usually about exploring the smallness of man against an indifferent nature and what that means. Well, what does it mean for manking when there is a Blood War that has waged for endless aeons between two unstoppable forces moved only by hatred? The scale of the Blood War dwarfs human endeavor, and nothing any cutter does ever really changes things in any meaningful way. Looking into that abyss (or the actual Abyss for that matter) presents a blood with plenty to think about.</p></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><p>I read a novel once where an utterly evil demon - or, at least, his minions - was a major character. It was <em>Dawn Song</em> by Michael Marano. What it did, though, is contrast this demon (Belial, and the succubus that served him) with an even more unsympathetic demon. Where Belial was an individualistic, intelligent, freedom-loving evil, his rival Leviathan was ignorance, jingoism, and and brutal conformity personified. As a result, even though both sides of the conflict were murderous and awful, the reader was forced to identify with and root for Belial if only because the alternative was so much worse.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

          Putting films as examples,        </div>

         <p><p>Putting films as examples, as someone stated above, I'd put Joker as Chaotic Evil great villain.</p><p>And about a Devils, I like for example when in "The Godfather" (Mafia stuff always works with my players) Don Corleone refuses to use his influence on judges to sell drugs because they are not good, and doesn't want his grandsons and grandaughters to suffer from drugs. That shows something special in the character; he wants power, he wants to be the highest, but drugs? no, that's nasty. I think a fat Pit Fiend with a special voice could do a good job.</p><p>I also like the concept of the old film "The Seventh Seal" (and the chess game between Death and the knight). A Yugoloth for example would like to "play" with life and death, leaving to live, but following until the inevitable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><p>Well, to me an alignment of a character is like an alignment descriptor of a spell. If you only know a spell is [Evil], you know how it interacts w/ rules regarding such spells, but not why it is [Evil]. It might be because it creates undead, because it summons Evil creatures, b/c it harms/impedes Good creatures etc. Same goes for evil characters - there is a myriad of possible reasons why "s/he's evil" applies to a given person and fiends are no different save for the fact this statement is supposed to apply to almost every one of them.&nbsp;</p><p>There are two kinds of fiends:</p><p>- people who became evil in life, died and found themselves in an environment that strongly promotes Evil; they are now fiends who are Evil because every for every time they had to choose, the evil choice was the right choice and those who chose otherwise are dead</p><p>- those spawned by a lower plane itself/created by somebody start out with pre-programmed malice, then circumstances conspire that the personality they eventually develop is that of an evil person (see above, but )</p><p>"They are all evil" =/=&nbsp;"They are all evil for evil's sake"</p><p>And one final thought: Once you get down to it, helping people gives you a farm fuzzy feeling inside, hurting people gives you satisfaction as well (sometimes). It's a matter of which one of this feelings you like better and feel more often. Tis is my definition of good and evil.</p></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><p>Interesting ideas presented here, it's given me a lot of food for thought. The biggest thing I am drawing from this is the "Rule of Cool." That is, a fiendish doesn't need to be sympathetic as long as he's well-executed. It also seems that most fiends are best used as foils - either for other fiends or for less evil characters. Exceptions exist, of course. Does that sound like a reasonable assessment?</p></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

          Re: On Fiends and Sympathy, a Literary Discussion        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>I tried to write something for this thread when it was still fresh along these lines, but my examples always wandered everywhere. Last night's game gives a really good one though, so I'll have another stab.</p>

<p>So, my character is an alu-fiend brought up in Oghma's Realm, and except when she loses her temper she's a generally nice and 'good' person - this story is not about her.</p>

<p>She's searching the ruins of a city attacked by Graz'zt's armies for survivors - and comes across a fiend (alu-fiend ... ish) who is using the blood of a wounded paladin friend of hers to paint a fantastic mural on the wall.</p>

<p>We hit the dice when my character tries to disintegrate her. The artist fiend is very much 'WTF are you doing?! That could have killed me!' and takes cover behind a boulder and tries to reason with her. My character calms down enough to be reasonable (having been reminded of her <span style="font-style:italic">other</span> evil friend who sees nothing wrong with draining humans dry of blood, but is generally a nice person).</p>

<p>And then it gets *difficult* - from painterfiend's point of view - my character is being completely insane and unreasonable. And what's more - her point of view is completely valid. Once I stopped trying to turn her into dust and actually talked to her - well, it takes some warping of perspective to talk to a fiend. But painterfiend is the wronged party in this - she's the sympathetic character despite being evil and actively doing an evil thing. All she wants to do is finish her painting. I felt like a dick for trying to kill her.</p>

<p>So: Fiends are sympathetic if you look at it on their terms and their norms, rather than ours. That can be fairly brainbreaking to do, but once you get past the whole 'okay, yes - that's evil' thing, there's plenty of other ways in which they can be sympathetic.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>This particular subject was brought up by Joseph Campbell--not in terms of Planescape, but in terms of Judeo-Christian belief. I myself am not religious, but I thought this to be an excellent example.</p>

<p>Can you find sympathy for the Devil (with a capital 'D') himself, the source of all evil and sin? If you can find sympathy for Lucifer, you could probably do the same for any other fiend. In order to do this, there has to be some sort of divinity left in him--but his punishment was to be separated from God, the one who Lucifer loved the most, and therefore from divinity.</p>

<p>Campbell points out that the Devil is not completely devoid of the presence of God. His divinity lies within his memory of the echo of the voice of his Beloved's last word to him: "Begone."</p>

<p>Now this is not to say that, if you have sympathy for the Devil, he won't snatch your soul and make you suffer in half-a-second. But the divine spark is still there.</p>

<p>So there has to be some sort of thing we call divinity in these fiends to elicit any sort of sympathy. In the post above, for example, the alu-fiend is painting, or <span style="font-style:italic">creating</span>, which is considered a divine act. This doesn't excuse her actions from the label of "evil," but it certainly elicited sympathy from Aik.</p>

<p>Of course, it's always fun to have an irredeemable fiend who everyone loves to hate--kind of like the Joker in the Dark Knight. All you need is a single, undeniably evil (and convincing) motive, have all the fiend's actions center around and spring from this motive.</p>

<p>Hopefully this little write-up helps.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>I disagree vehemently. The vast majority of Fiends aren't flawed. They're perfectly evil. Of course, before you can decide if it's possible to portray perfectly evil beings sympathetically, you have to decide what evil is in the context of the story you're writing. Personally, I think evil is selfishness, self-centeredness. When you take that to the level of a fiend, nothing but yourself matters. You can still have standards, of course, but they probably have more to do with personal pride than with "lines you won't cross." For example, the way I see it, an LE creature would keep their word, not because lying harms others, but because it sees it as demeaning, cowardly and promoting Chaos. As a consequence, NE creatures are probably the most unprincipled of all.</p>

<p>Now, the question is, can you write a character sympathetically if he ultimately cares about nothing more than his own self-aggrandizement and desires? I think it would be possible, but I think it would be really hard. A place to start might be Mike Carey's Lucifer comic, although the evil Lucifer displays is pretty low-key compared to most D&amp;D fiends. Another place to look might be C.S.Lewis' Screwtape Letters; although Screwtape is supposed to be anything but sympathetic. More importantly though, I don't think a character, even a protagonist, needs to be sympathetic to be engaging. The Joker is a good example. He's an insane sadist with no redeeming features, but everyone still hangs on his every word to see what he'll do next. If I had to guess, I'd say it's because he has a certain style, a sense of scale to what he does. So, come to think of it, does Lucifer. You can get away with a lot as a protagonist, even if you're completely unsympathetic, if you're not petty.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I don't agree with your definition of evil - I'd say evil is causing harm. I see no reason why selfishness is <span style="font-style:italic">necessarily</span> a bad thing, and defining evil as that misses out on a large spectrum of 'evil'. That there's the possibility of accidental evil acts in D&amp;D/Planescape kind of rules out your definition also, I think.</p>

<p>Eh - it seems like you're defining them into a corner where they're necessarily unsympathetic - I don't think that's the best way to go. It's fine to have some characters that are utterly unsympathetic, but having an infinite number of them is kinda dull. I don't think their evilness needs to be compromised to make them sympathetic.</p>

<p>Also, I'm not sure how your post fits in with the example I gave. Painterfiend is both pure evil (by both our definitions) and sympathetic. She's sympathetic <span style="font-style:italic">despite</span> being evil - although I'm sure that an evil character would have no trouble sympathising with her. Her sympathetic characteristics are essentially irrelevant to her moral alignment though.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>That doesn't work. Evil isn't a collection of actions with the "evil" label. If you're going to assign alignment to people, not just actions,  Evil has to be an outlook, a worldview. And if the Evil worldview is characterised as "willing to cause others harm", then it's basically impossible for adventurers (and most other people, too) to be anything but evil. Being willing to cause others harm has to be Neutral, otherwise something like a Paladin can't really exist at all. Which is why I say that I characterise the Evil worldview as "I am worth more than other people, I don't have to care about other people as I go about getting what I want." I.e selfishness and/or self-centeredness. It's certainly true that Evil people will likely be a lot more cavalier about harming others than neutral or good people, but that's a symptom, not the cause. If you think evil characters as presented by me are necessarily unsympathetic, that's your business, but I don't see it that way. I do agree with you that from the point of view of Evil, it's everyone else who's being unreasonable or even insane, but I'd say that if Evil is just "the willingness (or even eagerness) to cause others harm", then it isn't actually a coherent viewpoint. It's just accepting fewer limitations on your behaviour. I certainly don't see how it is any easier to sympathise with than my view.  You say that my view leaves out a great spectrum of evil, though, and I'd like to hear which parts. I won't adress your example, because my original post wasn't intended as a response to you, but more to Maharishi and Hyena of Ice.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>One easy way to do this is to grant a villain a personal quality that might be considered admirable, but which does not actually require <span style="font-style:italic">good</span> alignment.</p>

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>I think evil characters (or characters with evil motivations) can be sympathetic, though to me creatures that aren't choosing to be evil aren't frightening.</p>

<p>A sympathetic character that was done well in at least the 1st and 2nd seasons was Dexter. He is a serial killer who likes killing serial killers. This is just his MO, he isn't a hero or a good person. In fact, in some ways it is more disturbing that he aligns with an avenging angel character. It is similar to sympathising with a baatezu's code of honor or a tanar'ri's love of freedom.</p>

<p>Fiends can have tragic flaws, can love in a twisted way, can exhibit characteristics we admire as others said. A disciplined martial artist can be callous and evil but still be admirable. A hard working lemure who climbs his way to pitfiend status can make us feel empathy.</p>

<p>The key, as I see it, is Evil is a matter of degree. We all want to succeed, to have things, want to be secure in our lives, etc. Fiends might, in a twisted way, be portrayed as enviable. We might wish that a love return to us - a fiend would simply kill suitors or charm them to perform horrible acts...and then be a comforter/healer. We wouldn't do something like this, as it would horrify us...but the fiend is the one that gets the boy/girl.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>The big example of evil that's missed out by a 'selfishness' definition is, well - selfless evil. Think Magneto (well - depending on who's portraying him...) - he's doing all this evil stuff because he cares about the future of the mutants and thinks that 'evil' methods are the only way. </p>

<p>I tend to look at alignment more as a way of catagorising the sum of people's actions rather than their subjective worldview. Even if you think you're doing good, but you do it by 'evil' means - you're still evil. Trias the Betrayer in PS:T still believes he's LG and is doing everything for the the 'good' causes, sure - but he's still evil. His plan of bringing about the greater good is evil by - well, the standards of the sort of people we like to call 'good', anyway.</p>

<p>And there's that example of the fallen devas in the Abyss who are trying to help people and hold themselves to a 'good' worldview but by their actions are clearly evil now (and they're still being selfless - only their idea of what 'selflessness' is has been warped dramatically). </p>

<p>Although I will accept that for D&amp;D purposes the 'causing harm' definition may need some tweaking/throwing out. Launching raids into the Lower Planes isn't an evil act, even if it causes harm to the fiends who live there. </p>

<p>As for pure evil being apathy ... well, I'm not sure about that. The yugoloths sure aren't apathetic and they're the exemplar of neutral evil, so there's more to it than that, and it's not like all the tanar'ri are secretly apathetic underneath their rage...</p>

<p>Edit: Eh, maybe this is all rather beside the point.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>I think the distinction should be made between evil characters and evil fiends. The question was in regards to fiends specifically. It's easy to imagine evil characters that are sympathetic, because we grant them their humanity and their complexity. The aren't incarnations of anything, they are beings of free will whose actions and motives are complex and unique. </p>

<p>Fiends on the other hand are creatures whose very nature is evil. It is not my impression in canon that fiends simply choose their position as fiends. They are simply that way. Those who violate the standard are unique in character and require unique explanations for their deviation. To suggest that fiends as a whole are sympathetic is to rewrite the Planescape mythology and to rethink what the fiends are about and what the purpose of the bloodwar is. I personally have no objection to that (one might reimagine fiends as being actually former agents of divinity turned stag and slowly corrupted in their fanatic devotion to law and chaos respectively). But the fact is, the fiends as written in canon are beings that embody evil, and consequently are only sympathetic in so far as we find certain evil acts sympathetic. The example of the character Dexter was given. Personally I don't think Dexter is truly meant to be a sympathetic character (after all, he is a violent inhuman sociopath who completely disregards any boundaries beyond his own inclination), but we can identify with the acts of violence he commits because of its target and thus rationalize the evil. Potentially, the rationalization is enough to allow us to sympathize with the evil doer. Still, this does not broadly make fiends as a class sympathetic. rather, it may give us specific reasons for rationalizing parts of their evil because we see it in ourselves, and thus can identify. If an individual fiend embodies a specific evil that we have in ourselves (such as a lust for vengance), then that fiend might become sympathetic to us by coincidence of inclination.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I said selfishness, but I clarified just afterward: "[Evil people see themselves as being] worth more than other people, [they] don't have to care about other people as they go about getting what they want." That doesn't have to mean that they don't care about other people ever at all. I see Magneto as fitting my definition because he doesn't care (and this is true of pretty much any incarnation) what he has to do to humans to bring about mutant superiority, and he's perfectly willing to attack mutants who oppose his plans, too. (Wouldn't be much of an X-Men comic otherwise.)<br />
I don't remember the details of Trias' plan, and I don't know about these Deva you mention, but if you could provide some more information, I'd love to adress it. I do agree with you that Evil is not apathy, in any sense. Attempts to portray evil as "hollow" or ultimately nihilistic in a D&amp;D context annoy me. The whole point of the alignment system as I see it is that there are 9 valid options, it's only the people of a given alignment who think there's 1 true option and 8 different ways to be wrong.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Evil alignment in D&amp;D is defined by harming others unjustly.  There are also specific acts that are classified as "evil".  This includes animating or controlling undead creatures (simple to understand for the animating part; the undead, ESPECIALLY corporeal undead and other 'animated' dead are a danger to all living things, innocent or not, and upset the natural ecological balance in a wild habitat.  You would get the exact same alignment penalty for creating a bio-agent.  The rebuking part is more difficult to explain, other than that the power to rebuke undead usually comes from evil dieties and powers.)<br />
Poison-use is also (generally) classified as evil, or at the very least non-good, at least when used against intelligent creatures.  This is because poisons don't simply kill the victim, they kill it slowly and painfully.  Disease-based spells are similarly evil, for the same reason that creating undead is evil; it endangers innocent lives.</p>

<p>Lawful Evil characters are bullies and tyrants.  Unlike other evil alignments they usually have honor codes, but they are evil nonetheless.  Lawful evil folks are the types who would commit an evil act, so that a 'good' result may come of it.  Archtypes include school bullies, extortionists, corrupt religious leaders, and tyrants/despots.  Other archtypes include the 'holier than thou' crusader/knight/etc. who views non-evil races or religions as the embodiment of evil and vows to destroy them all, 'purifying' the world.  In general, genocide is an evil act unless the alignment of the race/monster in question is listed as "always ___ evil".  Magneto is an example of a lawful evil character.  Evil characters who commit genocide against "usually ___ evil" races (such as Magneto) tend to justify the killing of non-evil members of that race (if they believe such a thing exists) as an act of mercy.  Lawful evil characters generally respect the law, but they're also all about finding loopholes and fuzzy math/words to exploit.   </p>

<p>Neutral evil characters are what I like to call "neutral selfish".  They are pure evil, but are defined (usually) by their willingness to do absolutely anything to further their own goals or desires.  Archtypes include the narcissist and the sociopath.  If you've ever played Chrono Trigger, Magus is a perfect example of a neutral evil character.  Neutral evil characters, despite being 'pure evil', generally don't go out of their way to be evil.  They may or may not harm others just for the fun of it depending on their personality (e.g. Ogremoch), though there is usually a purpose or method to their evil (most neutral evil characters only kill for fun if provoked or if having a bad day)  The majority are happy to just leave people alone unless bothered-- or if harming innocents somehow advances their plans (such as a necromancer who needs innocent villagers for spell components)</p>

<p>Chaotic evil characters are evil and chaotic, the worst kind of evil: evil without rhyme or reason.  Archtypes include thrill-killers, lust-killers, and serial killers; spree-killers.  They don't live by society's rules, and they kill just for the thrill of it.  Their evilness is bestial in nature; in the case of intelligent creatures, this means submitting completely to their primal urges.  Many horror-movie monsters are chaotic evil (the general rule with non-intelligent creatures is that if they aren't killing sentient creatures for food or to defend territory-- that is, if they kill just to kill, then they're chaotic evil.)</p>

<p>Conclusion: Evil isn't simply 'harming others', it is 'harming others unjustly or excessively'.  Unfortunately when it comes to lawful evil, we get into a REALLY fuzzy subjective area.  Is it lawful evil to punish a thief by chopping off his hand?  What about execution, when there was no witnesses to the crime or DNA evidence (thus no 100% guarantee that you're not about to execute an innocent man).       </p>

<p>As for being sympathetic, it is quite easy to make a lawful evil character, even a devil, appear sympathetic to the audience.  Again, tragedy does wonders.  After all, if someone were to kill Fierna, could we really blame Belial for subjecting her killer to a slow, painful, heinous death?</p>

<p>Lawful evil mortals are even easier to sympathize with.  Most of them, after all, have noble goals; the problem is that they use evil methods to further those goals.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>No.  Negative energy in and of itself is not evil (you will note a complete lack of the 'evil' descriptor for spells like "Chill Touch", for example.).  What determines whether or not it is evil is how it is used.  For instance, using Chill Touch in battle to defend oneself or another is not evil, and may actually be a good act.  Using "create undead" is an evil act because it recklessly endangers other people and harms the environment.</p>

If done recklessly when there are other options, yes.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>I have an issue with this definition, and it may be because of my definition of justice.</p>

<p>To me, justice is a lawful trait, not a good one. As a result, a lawful evil person is perfectly capable of harming someone in a just way. Besides, if you're cutting off the hand of a thief, is that really so unjust? In some societies, that's perfectly acceptable conduct -- not considered evil at all. Indeed, the greater evil is the thief.</p>

<p>Need I mention the cliche, "justice is blind?" <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/smile.png" title="Smiling" alt="Smiling" class="smiley-content"/></p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>But zombies and skeletons are mindless. They obey whoever is controlling them. They could be told to go save children from a burning building or plant crops in a field. There's nothing that states their actions always endanger others.</div></p>

<p>The third book of the Death Gate Cycle actually deals with this. When members of the society die, they are raised as zombies to continue working, and they fill the same roles they did in life. Farmers continue to farm, carriage drivers continue to drive, soldiers remain soldiers.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Well, I agree to an extent with the distinction between evil characters of (most) other races and evil fiends - fiends were 'born evil'. I don't think this equates to being unsympathetic. Even a creature of pure evil can do things for reasons to which we're sympathetic - sure, maybe they murder people for the lulz on a regular basis - but 'because I'm evil' isn't the only reason they might murder someone.</p>

<p>And there's a whole range of things that are alignment neutral activities that they could engage in that makes them sympathetic.</p>

<p>Being evil just because you're evil doesn't mean you can't have depth, basically - and once a character has depth it should be possible to empathise with them in some way. Now - a lot of fiends aren't going to have any depth - they're just mindless killers and such - but the majority of intelligent fiends are going to have more to life than slaughtering people wholesale. Innately evil creatures can still have friends, attachments, relationships, hobbies, and whathaveyou that aren't related to being evil in the two-dimensional because-I'm-evil thing.</p>

<p>My recollection of Trias's plan is a little shonky as well <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/tongue.png" title="Sticking out tongue" alt="Sticking out tongue" class="smiley-content"/> As I recall it was a 'I will do this horrible thing, and then we can properly get on with purging evil from the Planes'. Evil in service of the greater good - a <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist" class="bb-url">well intentioned extremist</a>.</p>

<p>Don't feel like looking the devas up right now - but I imagine they're detailed in Planes of Chaos in the GM's book under The Abyss.</p>

<p>I have big problems with Hyena of Ice's definitions of the alignments - they don't do enough to separate the law-chaos axis from the good-evil one, and it ends up sounding like the first is just a descriptor for the second. I don't think that's the case. 'Chaotic evil' means that you're both chaotic and evil - and those can be entirely unrelated to each other. A chaotic evil fiend - no matter how evil they are - doesn't have to act like a spree-killer or the like. They could just as easily be free spirited or a non-conformist as a psychopath.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>I've played fiends many times, not just as NPCs but as PCs as well. The first thing i have to say is that they are very very hard to get right. You can't play a CE character and run around slaughtering people unless you plan on going solo or having the good people of the world roast your hide. The same is true for LE fiends. For the most part Yugoloths stay NPCs cause i can never get into them so i'll stick with explaining these and hope it carries over.</p>

<p>Fiends are Evil. Got it. They are dirty, nasty, conniving little monsters. They live forever unless killed. They are infinitely patient and terribly smart...except the few stupid breeds. Now being that smart they are going to have some serious thoughts going on. Plans from centuries ago, masters that they had in the past, their orders, and personal desires are all going to be motives for everything they do. Just because they are evil does not mean that they do not learn, adapt and grow.</p>

<p>Dragging a fiend into a good or neutral aligned party is rough but it is fairly common in most of my lower planar campaigns since there is a need for a native guide in many cases. Prudence and risk management are the things that most of mine use to keep their nature in check. Sure, they are always nudging their companions toward the darker ways out, tempting, but they do not come right out and hit people with it.</p>

<p>Fiends as villains are pretty easy in my opinion. They are much like my PCs only they can get away with more. Generally they are more powerful, confident and driven than whatever PC fiends crop up. They want power at any cost and do not care who is in their way. More LE might dodge around with laws and CE may just slaughter a whole village rather than try to reason with them. </p>

<p>In one of the games i am in right now the chief villain has a family. His mate is his former slave and his children are all fighting over his throne. He has a whole mess of family problems to go with the killing of the PCs. Little things like that can make characters easier to identify with and more memorable to PCs and players alike. It also provides a nice bit of "networking" for your PCs should they decide to team up with whatever usurping spawn comes out on top.</p>

<p>In another game similar i play a Kelvezu (demon) that was formerly in the service of Grazzt. He fought his way from nothing, rose to become a blood war general and was in the end sold to a nobody. In time he killed his new master and became a free demon in his own right...blah...blah...blah... as a retired character he guards a portal to Sigil from the Prime world of Krynn (Dragonlance) and sells armor imported from the planes. He's still very evil, but he bides his time, blends in and has a deep backstory to go along with his long life. No matter how horrible he is people still find that they are cheering for him to come out on top.</p>

<p>Even fiends can be "humanized" without losing their flavor or darkness. The point is to focus on some of the desires, motivation and personal drive as opposed to simply "He uses Metor Swarm on the village" actions. Fiends live forever and want to continue to do so. Only the foolish are going to start razing whole prime worlds when there is a Blood War to fight and in a century a little corruption now could spawn a whole army then.</p>

<p>Just sayin...</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

          Re: On Fiends and Sympathy, a Literary Discussion        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Sympathy means the ability to relate to and find commonality with another, both in the literal and literary sense. </p>

<p>At its broadest, a fiend can never be completely sympathetic because they are utterly inhuman beings to degree far more pronounced than say, elves, lizardfolk, or even dragons.</p>

<p>Fiends are manifestations and representations of a cosmic force in some fashion, and while they have a degree of free will (because it is possible for them to be redeemed) they are not born with a clean slate in the sense of Planescape mortals. In fact they are either born from the souls of sinners or torn from the raw firmament of evil (or more rarely, the offspring of evil fiends). So a fiend is never going to be a properly sympathetic character in the sense of a mortal or they aren't properly acting like a fiend.</p>

<p>That being said, a fiend can exhibit numerous sympathetic qualities, particularly if you take them outside of their standard environment and force the to play by other rules. There are some examples in existing D&amp;D literature where fiends have been used in such ways.</p>

<p>Karfhud, in Pages of Pain, exhibits some sympathetic qualities while still being an absolute bastard because he, like all the other characters, wants desperately to get out of the mazes and requires the assistance of others to do so.</p>

<p>Aliisza, the Alu-Fiend who appears in the War of the Spider Queen series (and later in material I have not read), though a relative minor character has some sympathetic qualities because she is observing a form of evil in the drow that is to hers eyes pretty messed up. So she is able to act as a sort of rational voice to note that, man the drow are one screwed up race of beings in a series wherein almost all the other characters swallow one or other drow lines of thought freely.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>You're right about my classification of the chaotic evil, Aik.</p>

<p>The main difference between neutral evil and chaotic evil is that well-- neutral characters will do something lawful one day and something chaotic another day.  <br />
Chaotic evil characters are defined by being more care-free and unorganized.  Being unorganized is a major feature of the alignment; chaotic evil characters have trouble working with others because they don't like playing by anyone's rules, and don't like taking orders.  Sure, they'll do so if they have to in order to survive, but they'll do so begrudgingly, and will likely complain (at least that's how the Tanar'ri do it).  <br />
Chaotic evil dieties and leaders are truly the worst to deal with however, since they tend to be defined by a degree of randomness.  A chaotic evil diety (Lolth, Ghaunadaur) may 'reward' a devoted worshipper positively or negatively for a job-well-done depending on their whims.  Ghaunadaur might turn a devoted worshipper into a non-intelligent ooze 'just because he feels like it' at the time.  Neutral evil dieties aren't this reckless and usually follow more of a formula.  Chaotic evil dragons are well known for 'rewarding' people and other creatures for a job-well-done by eating them.  They tend not to like working with sentient creatures unless they can charm them, because they're paranoid loners.  Chaotic evil characters tend to be impulsive (this can often be said of many free-spirited evil characters as well) and passionate (read: emotional).  <br />
Whereas neutral evil characters usually have no problem working with others so long as there's something in it for them, though they may have trouble resisting the temptation to backstab, sacrifice, eat, or experiment on the people they work with depending on their personality.  Neutral evil is usually less emotional and more methodical.  Chaotic evil characters often have problems with planning ahead.</p>

<p>Bottom line: Lawful and neutral evil are usually a more cold, calculating evil than chaotic evil, which is often defined by extreme emotion and recklessness.  Chaotic evil characters can also be free spirits as well, you are correct.<br />
Lawful evil characters are at least somewhat honorable and are big on following the law, on fidelity, and on keeping one's oath.  Neutral evil characters follow the law and keep oaths only so long as it benefits them.  Chaotic evil characters tend to abhor the ideas of laws and oaths.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Another trait I've noticed about the fiends is that they do ALL the things we consider socially reprehensible.  They LOVE to eat sentient beings, an idea we humans find deplorable (and in D&amp;D is considered an evil act if it's not done for the species' survival)</p>

<p>I haven't read the entirety of the Fiendish Codexes, Champions of Ruin, or the Book of Vile Darkness, though from some of the stuff I have read on the last one, and from what I've heard from others, most folks I have encountered (myself included) don't like a lot of the things in those books that are assigned good and evil labels (e.g. in the Book of Exalted Deeds, it describes how torture is a good act if it is used in a ticking-timebomb scenario against evil-aligned beings.  &gt;_&lt;.  Oh, and if we are to believe the Book of Vile Darkness, pot smokers are neutral evil or chaotic evil, and Pica is an evil act *Pica is a medical or psychological condition where the subject ingests inedible things such as paper or soil.  It is most frequently encountered in individuals suffering from chronic starvation/famine or pregnant women with vitamin deficiencies.  The disease associated with eating otyughs and oozes is absolutely stupid.*.  &gt;_&gt;)</p>

<p>Anyhow, enough on what's wrong with the "definition of good/evil" sections of BoED and BoVD.  <br />
Back to the subject:<br />
The fiends do all the things socially reprehensible in human society.  For instance, if you have the Fiendish Codex II, and open it to the section about Belial and Fierna, you will read a line that goes something like "Belial sees to it personally that Fierna *his biological daughter* knows the ways of pleasure and pain".  Now, if that wasn't a big enough clue for ya, the official art of Belial and Fierna depicts Belial with his hand on Fierna's backside.  (I apologize if this is too graphic for this board, I am simply describing what is found in one of WoTC's supplements, and IIRC, this one DOESN'T have a maturity warning on the cover *unlike BoED and BoVD*)<br />
Domestic abuse and child abuse seems to be universal among the fiends, as well.  <br />
In the Planescape supplement about the Planes of Law, the book goes on and on (not in detail) about how Baatezu condition rutterkin and other ranks through years of torture, in a sort of baptism of fire if I recall correctly.  This torture helps harden them into even more evil beings than before, and conditions them to be good soldiers/peons.</p>

<p>Now, on an example of sympathy, while not a fiend, I have been working a lot on fleshing out Cryonax, the evil Archomental of Ice.  While completely without compassion and completely evil, to some Cryonax (or at least some of his evil peons) can come off as somewhat sympathetic.  Cryonax (if you've read in my topic on the Civic Festhall.  Yeah, it was my first topic and I couldn't figure out where it belonged) is big on genetic and elemental experimentations to create new creatures to make into minions.  To that end, he is also highly interested in freakish mutations and natural hybrids.  Some of these hybrids (including his herald) are only alive because he took interest in them.  Unlike most of his artificially created minions, which are considered expendable, Cryonax is also rather protective of his natural hybrids; not because he feels any compassion or cares about them as sentient beings, but because he considers them to be his treasures (akin to natural jewels vs. lab-created jewels), and as valuable as any jewel.</p>

<p>Even if you don't find Cryonax sympathetic, you would surely find his herald sympathetic.  The product of a qorrashi (ice genies from Frostburn) mother and an ice paraelemental father, she was rejected by the Qorrashi and left in the Paraelemental wilderness to die as a baby.  There she was found by Cryonax's minions.  Cryonax took great interest in the hybrid baby and ordered his minions to raise her, and train her into one of his servants.  She is now fully grown, and is his herald, a fiecely loyal warrior and devotee to Cryonax who granted her life.  She considers Cryonax and the servants who raised her to be her family, and only shows compassion/affection towards them.  She is very cold-hearted and commits many evil acts (including bringing captured children for Cryonax's minions to experiment on), but she does it all out of gratitude towards Cryonax and the rest of her 'family'.   She wants revenge on the Qorrashi as a whole for leaving her to die.<br />
That said, Cryonax tries to keep her out of the laboratory since when she is there, she makes the devotees, transmuters, and necromancers 'waste' daily spells and magic items putting the sentient young/baby test subjects into a coma so that they don't suffer.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

No.  Negative energy in and of itself is not evil (you will note a complete lack of the 'evil' descriptor for spells like "Chill Touch", for example.).  What determines whether or not it is evil is how it is used.  For instance, using Chill Touch in battle to defend oneself or another is not evil, and may actually be a good act.  Using "create undead" is an evil act because it recklessly endangers other people and harms the environment.
</div></p>

<p>But zombies and skeletons are mindless.  They obey whoever is controlling them.  They could be told to go save children from a burning building or plant crops in a field.  There's nothing that states their actions always endanger others.</div></p>

<p>This is the reason why in my game, I house-ruled mindless undead as being slightly CN instead, and set Negative as associated with Chaos and Positive as associated with Law.  (I also changed the alignment requirements for positive/negative energy channeling similarly, but that was just because it's the logical conclusion from the former.)</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

</div></p>

<p>You know, this gets at the larger problem of the alignment system in D&amp;D. Good and Evil are almost entirely relativistic concepts, with social norms and in group-out group dynamics playing a huge rule in how a person assigns the label. Morality is based mostly on cultural specific rules for organizing a society. Some of those rules are fairly universal, such as prohibition on in-group murder, but generally speaking, group restrictions and special exceptions are unique and differentiate between those inside the group and those outside the group. Murder for example is O.K. in most societies under conditions of warfare, not because of some grand theological truth but simply because you are fighting an outside group. When you try to impose alignment on a gaming system, you are essentially saying the mechanics work according to a very specific cultural concept of right and wrong. By extension, this implies that a certain morality is correct, and other moralities are wrong in an absolute sense. </p>

<p>Even chaos and law have this issue, albeit to a much smaller extent. Rules are also generally culture specific, for much the same reason, and ones conviction to a set of rules is usually contingent upon their commitment to the society they are meant to uphold. So one can rationally oppose one set of laws while wishing to advocate another without this creating any contradiction, yet D&amp;D would have us penalize a player who wishes to overthrow one set of laws in favor of another. </p>

<p>The system also fails to allow for characters whose moral or ethical convictions are conditional, except with the blanket "Neutral" alignment, which is generally presented as "seeking balance" rather than "weighs situations on a case by case basis". Really, how many people just generally advocate "law" as an abstract concept as opposed to a specific set of rules that they think make sense in a given set of circumstances? I mean, even some people who promote  the overthrow of governments working outside the system in a chaotic fashion often simply aim to set up a new set of rules that makes sense to them. Still, the difference between law and chaos as alignments isn't nearly so grating, simply because they are descriptions of states rather than value judgments.</p>

<p>Sure you can shoehorn people into an alignment system, but it sort of limits dynamic characterizations by placing an "objective" judgment on the act via explicit mechanics. While I have no problem with moral convictions as a feature of a character, I do have a problem with that moral dynamic being systemic. In general, this produces a bifurcated set of character concepts where nuance is pushed to the margins and Judeo-Christian morals are explicitly rewarded. Alternatively you end up with those who are merely oppositional to the same and end up being rude parodies or a mere negative image. </p>

<p>A good example is Objectivism. From the perspective of the objectivist, extreme self reliance and enlightened self interest results in a greater good for humanity in general. From the Judeo-Christian perspective which tends to emphasize sacrifice for the group and which rewards martyrdom, a philosophy like Objectivism is anathema. Both consider themselves to be producing a greater good, and both consider the opposing philosophy to produce a certain kind of evil. Which one is correct (if any) is beside the point really. The problem is, the D&amp;D alignment system takes sides on these debates, and consequently renders the debate itself moot by declaring one side evil and the other good. Many such debates would never be had if we had a real world analog of rather absurd spells like Know Alignment. </p>

<p>I think part of the great wonder and mystery of such metaphysical and philosophical debates is that no one really knows the answer, and consequently a great human drama plays out over various fundamental disagreements. Nations are born and wars are made over points of theology where both sides are convinced of their own righteousness. D&amp;D would render these disagreements upon an 8 point alignment system that uses an objective measure. I think that does a disservice to the range of the human imagination. Maybe in the debate over good and evil, someone somewhere is actually 100% right, but I don't think it's the D&amp;D alignment system, and I would rather they not cloud a game with their rather simplistic mechanic, particularly in a setting like Planescape where the entire setting revolves around these very debates.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

You know, this gets at the larger problem of the alignment system in D&amp;D. Good and Evil are almost entirely relativistic concepts, with social norms and in group-out group dynamics playing a huge rule in how a person assigns the label. Morality is based mostly on cultural specific rules for organizing a society. Some of those rules are fairly universal, such as prohibition on in-group murder, but generally speaking, group restrictions and special exceptions are unique and differentiate between those inside the group and those outside the group. Murder for example is O.K. in most societies under conditions of warfare, not because of some grand theological truth but simply because you are fighting an outside group. When you try to impose alignment on a gaming system, you are essentially saying the mechanics work according to a very specific cultural concept of right and wrong. By extension, this implies that a certain morality is correct, and other moralities are wrong in an absolute sense. 
</div>
There are quite a few points here. Simply put, our society views killing (sentients) as evil. However, this was not the case in medieval Europe. But if we accept that there is really an ultimate good and evil (as typified by the planes), then there MUST be an actual set of "good" behaviors and "evil" behaviors.</p>

<p>To me, there are some simple guidelines. The first is the Golden Rule - do unto others as you would have done to you. This is the central tenet of "good". The second tenet is compassion (and by extension, love). A good person feels compassion for a foe, even if he must kill them.</p>

<p>Conversely, an evil creature rarely follows the golden rule, and lacks any compassion (or very little). Selfishness - the advancement of self over others - becomes a primary tenet for evil.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>Archdukechocula</em> wrote:</div>
Even chaos and law have this issue, albeit to a much smaller extent. Rules are also generally culture specific, for much the same reason, and ones conviction to a set of rules is usually contingent upon their commitment to the society they are meant to uphold. So one can rationally oppose one set of laws while wishing to advocate another without this creating any contradiction, yet D&amp;D would have us penalize a player who wishes to overthrow one set of laws in favor of another. 
</div>
Actually, law and chaos are easier to see, if harder to define. Many conflicts in modern shows actually appear to be Law-Chaos conflicts rather than Good-Evil conflicts. One person wants to act outside the system, or "fix" the system, while another believes the system to be largely beneficial. Depending on the storyteller's (director's) view point, the Good person could be the Chaotic person if he wants to show the system as corrupt or inefficient. Alternately, the Good person could be the Lawful one if the storyteller wants to emphasize the benefits of harmony.</p>

<p>Of course, such conflicts are largely subjective. Sometimes the Chaotic person in one conflict becomes the Lawful one in another (even within the same story).</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>Archdukechocula</em> wrote:</div>
Sure you can shoehorn people into an alignment system, but it sort of limits dynamic characterizations by placing an "objective" judgment on the act via explicit mechanics. While I have no problem with moral convictions as a feature of a character, I do have a problem with that moral dynamic being systemic. In general, this produces a bifurcated set of character concepts where nuance is pushed to the margins and Judeo-Christian morals are explicitly rewarded. Alternatively you end up with those who are merely oppositional to the same and end up being rude parodies or a mere negative image. 
</div>
However, the existence of the planes does explicitly demand an alignment system. Good and Evil, Law and Chaos have physical manifestations.</p>

<p>In Planescape, the Good vs. Evil conflict is not "the bad guys need to be punished, but really "is Good a better path to follow than Evil"? That is even more metaphysical.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>Archdukechocula</em> wrote:</div>
A good example is Objectivism. From the perspective of the objectivist, extreme self reliance and enlightened self interest results in a greater good for humanity in general. From the Judeo-Christian perspective which tends to emphasize sacrifice for the group and which rewards martyrdom, a philosophy like Objectivism is anathema. Both consider themselves to be producing a greater good, and both consider the opposing philosophy to produce a certain kind of evil. Which one is correct (if any) is beside the point really. The problem is, the D&amp;D alignment system takes sides on these debates, and consequently renders the debate itself moot by declaring one side evil and the other good. Many such debates would never be had if we had a real world analog of rather absurd spells like Know Alignment. 
</div>
This is actually a good example of my earlier point. Objectivism sounds like a more "chaotic" philosophy than Christianity. Neither is necessarily good or evil. There are good objectivists and good Christians (and bad ones too).</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

Therefore, when we apply a cosmology of good and evil in Planescape, we eliminate that amgibuity and that drama by saying "X is good and Y is evil, regardless of your opinion". Hence we get people who eat paper being evil, regardless of the fact that in reality, such conditions are caused by iron deficiencies. </p>

<p>But of course what a given individual wants done and not done is cultural and individual specific. How do you apply the Golden Rule for a masochist? Is it good for them to cause pain because they enjoy it? Ultimately, the Golden Rule is inherently relativistic, because it considers only the point of view of the individuals sense of right and wrong. So actually the Golden Rule can't be applied universally, and runs up against the alignment system, which says rules are speficic as to what constitutes good and evil.</p>

<p>The compassion one is also problematic, because it assumes that emotion is the primary vehicle for goodness. What of one who adheres to a set of moral considerations for purely rational reasons? Kantian philosophy is a moral philosophy that argues entirely against emotional considerations for moral action, since emotions are often misleading, even when a feeling is positive. </p>

<p>I explicitly said law and chaos are less problematic. I simply illustrated that even this dynamic has problems in that it requires behavior that is consistent to a higher abstract concept of Law and Chaos as opposed to seeing Law and Chaos as means to an end, which is really the way almost every human being actually uses these things. Most people will readily obey laws so long as they consider them to function well, but will oppose the same legal order if they see it as not serving a larger purpose. In other words, people's "lawfulness" or "chaoticness" is almost entirely situational. Very few people really advocate Law merely as an abstract principle rather than a tool that serves a given purpose. </p>

<p>I entirely disagree. There is no need whatsoever for the alignment system in Planescape. The conflicts can be rendered entirely as disagreements of philosophical outlook, with each side convinced their idea is right. There is no need to project a moral judgment and say Baatezu are evil and Celestials are good. It can simply be said that what separates them are their means, their goals and their outlook on life. We don't have to use an alignment system that says anything. Their beliefs, their relationships and their conflicts are still there with or without an alignment system. Human history provides us with plenty of examples without the need for alignment to bolster the narrative. </p>

<p>What I am saying is that the Judgment of each is absolute and contradictory. Two different people can consider themselves good and the other evil. Normally, this is just a difference of opinion. In D&amp;D, one is right and the other wrong. I think that diminishes the conflict because it paints one side as merely petulant and the other as cosmologically correct. I say the conflict itself is a large part of the drama, and what fuels the conflict is the fact that both sides can legitimately believe that they are right and good and that the other side is vile and evil. In fact that is a pretty well established feature of human psychology. I don't like whitewashing that with simplistic moral mechanics.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Those are just words. The fact that someone (most people in Sigil, for example) describe those philosophical opinions that baatezu and tanar'ri share in common as "evil" and those opinions that the archons and eladrins share as "good" doesn't really change anything about the setting - it changes the way things are perceived, of course, but the setting would be identical if we replaced the loaded moral terms with nonsense words like "bleen" and "grue." You seem to be making too much of semantics. </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>In D&amp;D, one is right and the other wrong.</div></p>

<p>That's not necessarily the case. It can be proven objectively, in D&amp;D, that someone is aligned with Baator, but it can't be proven that a word in one particular language, "evil," is necessarily the word that best applies to that plane. The planes are objective, but language is not. </p>

<p>In fact, one of the big criticisms of the Great Wheel cosmology that I've read is that, being a perfectly symmetrical circle, it presents all alignments as equally valid choices; there's nothing inherent in the cosmology that says you can't diagram it with Baator on top, or Gehenna, unlike the traditional Christian cosmology where Heaven is always "above" and superior and Hell is always at the bottom of the cosmic chain. And that fundamental subjectivity bothers some people.</p>

<p> I'm pretty sure there's a quote in some Planescape book, in fact: "Good and Evil? Law and Chaos? Those are easy to define. Right and wrong? That's harder..."</p>

<p>An interesting feature of the 2e book <span style="font-style:italic">Giantcraft</span> was the alternate value system it included. Instead of speaking of good and evil, giants speak of <span style="font-style:italic">maat</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">maug</span>, which don't correspond to D&amp;D alignments at all. A hill giant or fire giant can be just as <span style="font-style:italic">maat</span> ("good") as a storm giant by fulfilling their cultural expectations, even if by alignment standards they're antithetical. A typical storm giant has values that are chaotic good by human standards, but how <span style="font-style:italic">maat</span> the storm giant is is considered more important in giant society.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>While D&amp;D as a whole, not just Planescape, has an explicitly objective moral spectrum, that doesn't mean it is as simplistic as 'X action is good while Y action is bad.' Intent and emotional state and circumstances all matter and can change the alignment of any given action in all sorts of ways.</p>

<p>What objectified alignments really mean in D&amp;D is that something, whether the gods or the cosmic sorting process of the multiverse itself is able to add up the summation of your moral actions and choices during life when you die and make a determination that 'You go here.'</p>

<p>This doesn't eliminate ambiguity, no one can tell a mortal exactly what to do in life to end up in a specific place. Certainly listening to fiends won't get you there. A mortal who follows every instruction supplied by a sucubbus is more likely a madman headed for pandemonium or a weak-willed law-abider destined for Acheron than a sociopath on his way to the abyss. Blind obedience to an Archon's will won't get you to Mt. Celestia either, but more likely Mechanus instead, as the truly just must constantly question whether they are doing right.</p>

<p>This is all further complicated by the existence of the 'Neutral' side of the Good and Evil axis (a mix of law and chaos is much easier to understand). It is <span style="font-style:italic">very, very</span> important recognize that much of what we associate with 'evil' in modern western society qualifies as neutral in D&amp;D. Serial murder because you're a paranoid schizophrenic: not evil at all: chaotic neutral. Mass genocide of a primitive ethnic group because you believe to your toenails they are inferior: lawful neutral. Standing on the side of a street twiddling your thumbs while a helpless beggar is beaten to death in front of you by brigands: true neutral.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Faces of Evil</span> went into a good deal of depth to make this point: in D&amp;D evil takes effort. You have to do horrible stuff because you can, not because you're getting a return, but simply because you like it. Low-ranking Baatezu don't scramble and scrape to gather damned souls as fast as possible and torture them just because their masters tell them to and they are terrified of failure (even though they are) but because they want to, it pleases them to do so. Every soul in Baator is there because it belongs there. It might be suffering horrible torture or spend millennia as a lemure, but deep down it believes everything if worth it for the chance to rise up and someday take the top spot of Asmodeus.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>ripvanwormer</em> wrote:</div>
Those are just words. The fact that someone (most people in Sigil, for example) describe those philosophical opinions that baatezu and tanar'ri share in common as "evil" and those opinions that the archons and eladrins share as "good" doesn't really change anything about the setting - it changes the way things are perceived, of course, but the setting would be identical if we replaced the loaded moral terms with nonsense words like "bleen" and "grue." You seem to be making too much of semantics. </div></p>

<p>If the words are intended to be meaningless, why even have an alignment system at all? Why choose terms that are overtly moralistic? I mean, one does not confuse a term like Evil with "unorthodox lifestyle". The word has an explicit meaning. Semantics has nothing to do with it. If anything, it is semantics to pretend like the word doesn't have that meaning. The whole function of the word is to pass moral judgment. It's meaning is not particularly amgiguous. </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>That's not necessarily the case. It can be proven objectively, in D&amp;D, that someone is aligned with Baator, but it can't be proven that a word in one particular language, "evil," is necessarily the word that best applies to that plane. The planes are objective, but language is not. </div></p>

<p>Yet Detect Evil is a spell, as is Protection from Evil. This implies an objective criteria by which the spell functions. Clearly the mechanics work according to a specific interpretation of meaning, not just semantics. There is a meaning both in the context of the game and in the real world, and they have direct consequences for the mechanics of the game itself. </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>In fact, one of the big criticisms of the Great Wheel cosmology that I've read is that, being a perfectly symmetrical circle, it presents all alignments as equally valid choices; there's nothing inherent in the cosmology that says you can't diagram it with Baator on top, or Gehenna, unlike the traditional Christian cosmology where Heaven is always "above" and superior and Hell is always at the bottom of the cosmic chain. And that fundamental subjectivity bothers some people.</div></p>

<p>Arranging them as a circle is also another byproduct of the whole alignment nonsense. Seeing as the alignment system is a 4 point axis, it naturally followed from a designer perspective to arrange the planes according to that same axis. The alignment doesn't imply equality or inequality, it just reflects the alignment axis. Also, I don't meant to suggest the cosmology of Planescape reflects the cosmology of Christian religion. Obviously it doesn't. It reflects the peculiar moral perspective of the game's creators overlayed onto a game system, and I get the distinct impression that the majority of the writers come from a Judeo-Christian culture that influences their sense of social and moral norms, even if they themselves aren't necessarily devote Christians. </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>I'm pretty sure there's a quote in some Planescape book, in fact: "Good and Evil? Law and Chaos? Those are easy to define. Right and wrong? That's harder..."</div></p>

<p>Now that is semantics. After all, Good is pretty much defined as Moral Rightness, and Evil as Moral Wrongness. In essence, that is an admission that the terms have been rendered meaningless, and if the terms are meaningless, then there really is no use in having them in the first place. To me that just sounds like an attempt by an author to work around the very alignment system the setting is burdened by through the actual use of a semantic trick. Good and Evil are only easy to define by virtue of that being an aspect of the D&amp;D system. In reality, Good and Evil are not at all easy to define. If anything, right and wrong are much easier to define because each are conditional upon factual evidence. I can demonstrate the laws of gravity, and consequently be right in an assertion as to its existence. The evidence makes the case practically unassailable. Good and Evil is contingent upon the metaphysical state of the universe (i.e. what God or Gods if any create the moral rules), which is naturally unprovable. </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>An interesting feature of the 2e book <span style="font-style:italic">Giantcraft</span> was the alternate value system it included. Instead of speaking of good and evil, giants speak of <span style="font-style:italic">maat</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">maug</span>, which don't correspond to D&amp;D alignments at all. A hill giant or fire giant can be just as <span style="font-style:italic">maat</span> ("good") as a storm giant by fulfilling their cultural expectations, even if by alignment standards they're antithetical. A typical storm giant has values that are chaotic good by human standards, but how <span style="font-style:italic">maat</span> the storm giant is is considered more important in giant society.</div></p>

<p>And that is an interesting idea. But ultimately it is a stealth admission that the alignment system doesn't really make a whole lot of sense, and is just an arbitrary morality mechanic that doesn't really accurately reflect people's conceptions of good and evil, because conceptions of these things are culturally defined.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>If the words are intended to be meaningless, why even have an alignment system at all? Why choose terms that are overtly moralistic?</div></p>

<p>I didn't say they were <span style="font-style:italic">intended</span> to be meaningless. The intention behind the AD&amp;D alignment system is to evoke the epic war of Good versus Evil in Tolkien's novels, and the more modernist, morally ambiguous Blood-Red Game between Law and Chaos in Michael Moorcock's fantasy novels. It's not supposed to be "universal," just to evoke specific fantasy tropes. Just like Gygax didn't put elves and hobbits in the game because they were appropriate for every conceivable setting; instead, he put them in there because fantasy gamers expected elves and hobbits.</p>

<p>The words aren't intended to be meaningless. Your <span style="font-style:italic">complaints</span> are meaningless, regardless of your intent. Baator is Baator whether you call the baatezu philosophy "evil" or not; the difference is purely semantic. Unless you're assuming that everyone in the multiverse speaks the same language, your fixation on the particular words used is absurd. The word for the philosophy of the Gray Waste is, in Planar Common, "evil." The yugoloths might call it something that translates better as "purity." Alignment is objective, but language is not. </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Yet Detect Evil is a spell, as is Protection from Evil. This implies an objective criteria by which the spell functions.</div></p>

<p>Sure. Detect Evil identifies beings and intent aligned with the Lower Planes. If you assume the spell names found in the Player's Handbook are actually what the characters call the spells in-world (which is a whole other debate), then they were named by people who speak a language that characterizes this philosophy as evil. </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Seeing as the alignment system is a 4 point axis, it naturally followed from a designer perspective to arrange the planes according to that same axis.</div></p>

<p>I don't disagree. But the arrangement exists, regardless of the reasons, and it <span style="font-style:italic">does</span> imply that each element of the axis is equally "valid" as far as the multiverse is concerned.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Now that is semantics. After all, Good is pretty much defined as Moral Rightness, and Evil as Moral Wrongness. </div></p>

<p>No, those definitions are meaningless. If you can't wrap your head around the idea that alignments are concrete philosophies, not subjective value judgments, than you'll never understand them well enough to give a valid critique. Perhaps it <span style="font-style:italic">would</span> be more useful to name them "bleen" and "grue" so that you can let go of your preconceived notions. </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>. In essence, that is an admission that the terms have been rendered meaningless</div></p>

<p>If it helps you to think of them that way, sure, but they actually have pretty specific meanings - just not the meanings you want them to have. You seem to <span style="font-style:italic">want</span> evil to mean "anything I think is wrong" and good to mean "anything I think is right," and you therefore see the fact that D&amp;D doesn't use the words that way as a "semantic trick" allowing the designers to avoid the "real" meaning of the words. Whether or not your definitions are actually the only "correct" ones is irrelevant to this discussion, so I won't belabor the issue.</p>

<p>The conceit of Planescape is that five primal philosophies formed the basis of an outer planar ring. </p>

<p>Bleen: a philosophy based on altruism and compassion, attempting - but not always succeeding - to strive for the benefit of all.</p>

<p>Grue: a philosophy based on hatred, the willful infliction of suffering, and the pursuit of power at the expense of others. </p>

<p>Rellow: a philosophy based on the idea that existence is, or should be, fundamentally ordered and capable of being systemically cataloged. Society and the security of the group is more important than individual happiness or freedom.</p>

<p>Yed: a philosophy based on the idea that existence is, or should be, fundamentally disordered, constantly changing, and systemic knowledge is ultimately futile. Individual freedom and choice is paramount, even at the expense of the stability and security of society as a whole. </p>

<p>Balance: a philosophy based on the idea that the four forces of Bleen, Grue, Rellow, and Yed must remain in a rough state of equilibrium for the cosmos to continue smoothly. Too much Bleen would create weakness and dangerous complacency; too much Grue would result in destruction. Too much Rellow and there is no progress; too much Yed and things become stagnant and sterile. There needs to be a <span style="font-style:italic">moderate</span> level of suffering and personal ambition. Too much of an extreme along any axis could result in the ultimate end of all things. </p>

<p>These five philosophies warred in the time before time, and ultimately blended to form 17 variations. Many other philosophies exist; some of these can be mapped onto the alignment grid in obvious ways, but many can't. That's okay; the Outer Planes are filled with realms that are placed arbitrarily, or for reasons having to do with themes other than the 9 alignments (for example, the Sign of One isn't based in the Beastlands because it's a neutral good with chaotic tendencies faction; none of the factions fit precisely into the alignment scheme, and this is deliberate). As the planes became more sophisticated, other philosophies and faiths came into being that had to find accommodations between one another and the five great forces, and this involves many marriages of convenience. The result is a Great Ring that is much more complex and interesting than thirteen gradations of five basic world views. </p>

<p>You don't have to believe that any of these philosophies are "true" in real life to accept the conceit the cosmology is based on. The five primal philosophies don't have to be obviously applicable to every religion and dogma that you can conceive of to be important in a fantasy game. </p>

<p>It's a fantasy game. I don't believe there are demons in real life bent on inflicting suffering because suffering and hatred are the things that they're made of. I don't believe there are unicorns and elves in real life either. But I can accept fantasy tropes as being interesting and valid in their own right within the context of the game.</p>

<p>Because it's a fantasy game, we don't say "bleen" and "grue." Instead, we use words like Good, Evil, Law, and Chaos because these are words with a long history in the literature of the fantastic, with strong emotional reactions associated with them. We use the words because they suggest meanings to us, meanings beyond "good is right and evil is wrong." We use words like heaven, Valhalla, purgatory, demon, archon, and hell for the same reasons - not because the way we use them are always mythologically accurate, or applicable to all cultures and all times, or because we're being true to any real-world preconceptions we may have, but because they're emotionally interesting.</p>

<p>And, honestly, getting hung up on those words is purely a semantic fixation. We have to call these ideas <span style="font-style:italic">something</span>, and words like Good and Evil are the most appropriate for the genre; in our fictional multiverse there are countless languages and perspectives, and our fictional yugoloths and giants (and countless others, on both the individual and cultural level) may observe these objective cosmic forces and come to other conclusions and give them other names. Some may name their "enlightened self-interest" Evil with a fierce pride, while others may refer to their world-view as simple hedonism or "maat." The spells that detect the essence that created the baernaloths may be commonly known as Detect Evil in the church of Pelor, but might be called "sense the sheen of the dark fathers" among the cultists of Nerull. The <span style="font-style:italic">force</span> is objective; the language used is not.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Thinking about it some more, I've realized that the points I've made have been rather scattershot. Looking at your "bleen grue" statement though, the point I've been sort of fumbling at finally crystallized for me in a way that I think will be much easier to articulate and understand.</p>

<p>I don't have a problem with the concept of alignment as an organizing principle for the planes, or your mythology, or anything else regarding the abstract nature of a setting. My problem with alignment is that D&amp;D encourages us to hold players to these rather unreal ideals. I think these ideals are Judeo-christian, as people are categorized according to Judeo-christian principles, but really that is besides the point. Whether it is good and evil or Grue and Blork, my real problem is that players are held to a very specific set of behaviors with little room for maneuver because there is a game relevant mechanic that describes a range of human perspectives, and you must pick one of them and stick to it. Whatever we called those perspectives, the problem is still there. Characters and NPCs have to find one and that's that. </p>

<p>Thus my main issue is that we have alignment like Lawful Good and Lawful Neutral, each professing that a person with said alignment should consistently follow the principles described therein. I think in reality, human beings rarely if ever follow such a system of principles as are described by alignment (Or breen and grue or what have you, the name is irrelevant). I think human beings are far too dynamic and people's moral and ethical considerations are far too situational to ever be encompassed by an abstract system of moral or philosophical axis. Basically, we as human beings are liable to change our guiding principles under various circumstances, and are constantly evolving from within as well. </p>

<p>If I were to try and use an alignment to describe myself, I would feel that any answer would be inadequate. Why should I think anyone else is any different? We are all very complex, liable to be good one day, bad the next, law abiding one day, lawbreaking the day after. Today's resistance fighter can be tomorrows lawman without any contradiction, and without any particular interest in "balance", even though their actions may even out over time by default (really, who on earth is truly "neutral" in the D&amp;D sense?). D&amp;D wants characters and NPC's to sort of fit in a box, and attempts to break out of that is considered poor form. I don't know about how 3e works on this issue as I don't play it that often, but in 2e, you were massively penalized for "violating" your alignment. I say violate the hell out of your alignment if it makes for a compelling story. In fact, disregard it all together if it gets in the way of a good yarn that makes sense in context. D&amp;D places the mechanic of alignment above that drama and above that story. I don't appreciate that.</p>

<p>In a larger sense, how much does it matter? Not much, because I can ignore it at my convenience as a DM. This is, after all, just a personal opinion. I don't mean to suggest I am right and you are wrong. Rather, I simply have an opinion about alignment and its impacts upon how we play. My view isn't inherently superior or inferior. I think we just have two different views. So please take my points in that light. I'm not intending to be argumentative merely for the sake of argument. I simply have a viewpoint that I hope to articulate clearly. Its merits or lack thereof are I think largely a matter of preference.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Alignment was not initially intended to represent a multiversal struggle. It was more designed to represent broad behavioral archetypes. It is certainly never presented in that light anyway before we had Planescape. Planescape just took that angle and ran with it. That is an after the fact interpretation of alignment. The multiversal struggle was written in response to alignment, not the other way around, so the whole "multiverse" argument really isn't all that related to the alignment issue as it generally relates to the D&amp;D system, which is mostly what my point was addressing.Also, as I mentioned, I don't really mind alignment in the specific context of mythology, mechanics aside. My argument was, again, in relation to how it affects characters and NPCs.</p>

<p>Secondly, if the GM is expected to make various exceptions  to the alignment rules, and there are rules within rules simply to dictate how a person plays their character, what is acceptable and what isn't in relation to the alignment principle, and so on and so forth, I wonder again, what purpose does alignment serve that isn't just as easily served by good roleplaying? Alignment is a "guide" for your character? Well I say we don't need that guide. The story should be the guide. I think the alignment thing is a needless set of rules on top of that. I don't think you can reasonably assert that I'm wrong. It's a matter of opinion.  Neither of us can prove our case really, because our case is based on a differing opinion on whether or not alignment negatively impacts characterization. It's clear to me at this point that you think it doesn't, whereas I think it does. Without some sort of ridiculous double blind study of the affect of alignment on gaming, they are just unprovable claims on both our parts.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Alignment was not initially intended to represent a multiversal struggle. It was more designed to represent broad behavioral archetypes.</div></p>

<p>No, that's not correct. The inspiration for the D&amp;D alignment system, most especially Poul Anderson's novel <span style="font-style:italic">Three Hearts and Three Lions</span>, is very much centered in a multiversal struggle (the war between the forces of Law and Chaos form the book's central conflict). That was the original point of the idea, with the original three-point alignment scale taken directly from that book.</p>

<p>It's been done in different ways in different games. In d20 Modern, alignment represents any sort of affiliation, not necessarily a moral or ethical one. In Palladium's games, it does indeed represent a rough summary of a character's moral stance, with no cosmic connection implied. In Chaosium's Elric! game, based more closely on Michael Moorcock's novels than D&amp;D was, a character's affiliation with Law, Chaos, or Balance is represented by a percentage score, and the various percentiles don't have to add up to 100 (they're calculated independently, and can total far more than that). But the Elric! RPG draws from some of the same major sources that D&amp;D does, and thus alignment serves a similar purpose. </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>It is certainly never presented in that light anyway before we had Planescape.</div></p>

<p>Yes, it very much was. Check out Gary Gygax's introduction to the original <span style="font-style:italic">Deities &amp; Demigods</span>: "Deities &amp; Demigods is an indispensable part of the whole of AD&amp;D... It is integral to Dungeon Mastering a true AD&amp;D campaign. Experienced players will immediately concur with this evaluation, for they already know how important alignment is, how necessary a deity is to the cleric, and how the interaction of the various alignments depends upon the entities that lead them." Some of that  is ad copy, but it's clear that as of 1980, Gygax drew a direct line between the alignments of PCs and the way those forces worked on the greater cosmic scale. </p>

<p>That's why they're called <span style="font-style:italic">alignments</span>, and not "philosophies" or "personality templates." They represent the cosmic forces that characters are aligned with. </p>

<p>The alignment system and what is now known as the Great Wheel cosmology evolved simultaneously, one dependent on the other. The nine-point AD&amp;D alignment matrix doesn't make any sense outside of it. The original article describing the nine-point alignment matrix, in the February 1976 issue of <span style="font-style:italic">The Strategic Review</span> magazine (the predecessor to <span style="font-style:italic">Dragon</span>), showed a map of the Outer Planes <span style="font-style:italic">first</span> (at the time including Heaven, Paradise, Elysium, Nirvana, Neutrality, Limbo, Hell, Hades, and the Abyss), listing the major planar beings (at the time Demons, Devils, Godlings, and Saints), before describing the qualities associated with the alignments themselves. </p>

<p>So, yes, you've got it exactly backwards.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>I wonder again, what purpose does alignment serve that isn't just as easily served by good roleplaying? </div></p>

<p>This is a common question. The answer is that in most settings, it serves no purpose except perhaps as a crutch for those who haven't developed their characters very extensively. That's why other RPGs developed by Gary Gygax didn't include alignment. </p>

<p>In D&amp;D, though, it represents how the characters are aligned with the cosmic forces that dominate the Outer Planes of existence. This is what it's meant from the beginning. It determines what a character's afterlife is, how they interact with various gods and planar beings, and - in 3rd edition - it determines various ability penalties as the character moves from plane to plane. Not every character has to choose sides in the great struggle - that's one of the reasons there's a neutral alignment, or "unaligned" in 4th edition. But for those who want to, alignment offers an mechanical way to do so. </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Alignment is a "guide" for your character? </div></p>

<p>Not particularly. Again, I think you've got it backwards. Alignment's never been meant to be more than a rough summary of a character's beliefs and actions. A good player defines the personality first, and the closest alignment is assigned afterwards, subject to revision as the character evolves over the course of the campaign. </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>I think the alignment thing is a needless set of rules on top of that. I don't think you can reasonably assert that I'm wrong. It's a matter of opinion.</div></p>

<p>You misunderstand me. I'm not trying to "prove" that alignment is a necessary part of any game or Planescape in particular. I'm sure you're capable of doing just fine without it. I'm correcting some genuine errors you've made about the original purpose of alignment and the history of the D&amp;D game. It began as a setting-specific mechanic meant to tie PCs closer to the grander themes of the milieu, not a crutch or something meant to limit a character's personality or growth. Choosing an alignment is much like choosing a faction; it helps define how the character relates to the campaign setting, but you can run a game without alignments much as you can run a game without factions.</p>

<p>Actually, thinking of the alignments as factions explains a lot about the curiosities of the alignment system as it was originally presented. Originally, each alignment had its own language associated with it, that only characters of that alignment knew. This doesn't make any sense of alignments are simply personality types, but it makes at least some sense if alignments are planar factions with their own associated religions and nations. In <span style="font-style:italic">Three Hearts and Three Lions</span>, all the various races were aligned with either Law, Chaos, or neither, and it was important to know who was aligned with what because there was a war going on. In <span style="font-style:italic">Quag Keep</span> by Andre Norton, the very first D&amp;D novel (written in 1978 with Gygax's close cooperation), Law and Chaos are also presented as concrete factions struggling for dominance over the world of Greyhawk, with characters openly identifying with one or the other (or neither), much like rival political parties or faiths. From that perspective, Gygax could claim that <span style="font-style:italic">Deities &amp; Demigods</span> was essential to AD&amp;D in the same way that <span style="font-style:italic">The Factol's Manifesto</span> is pretty essential to Planescape: because it shows who the leaders and other prominent high-ups are in the vast planar factions to which the PCs belong.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Well, if that is accurate, I honestly was completely unaware. I've played since first and read most of the 1st and 2nd edition materials, including Deities and Demigods (albeit I never owned that particular book), and that was never the impression I got from the books. Alignment always seemed to be something that was just an aspect of the game rather than an overarching theme. I really cannot recall an instance of this multiversal conflict being spelled out prior to Planescape, with the possible exception of the way the planes were laid out in Deities and Demigods and so forth (although I never played the Greyhawk setting, so I have no idea about that aspect). It's certainly possible I overlooked this feature of D&amp;D, but I just don't really remember this ever being spelled out anywhere.</p>

<p>In any case, I see the point you are making, and you certainly have some valid lines of evidence, so I'll concede the point. I still don't much like alignment, but it makes a great deal more sense if this was the way it was always intend. Having never read any of the novels you mentioned, I really had no idea about any of this (though I had heard of the Three Hearts and Three Lions), and if what you say is true, I do kind of wish they had spelled it out a bit more explicitly, as that would have drastically changed the way I read the game. Really I kind of wonder why this was never spelled out anywhere. Most roleplaying games go out of their way to let the players in on these things. I guess in D&amp;D we are just supposed to infer it. As I started D&amp;D at a rather young age, it never really occurred to me, and most of my analysis is retrospective and based on experiences with other RP systems.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Well, I don't think it's spelled out anywhere, which is why many designers treated the concept of alignment differently than Gygax did, though Good and Evil as a celestial conflict is very evident, for example, in the Dragonlance campaign, where being good or evil very much does mean you're choosing sides in a cosmic conflict (though of course Evil turns on itself), and there's some evidence that Balance is the "proper" state of the cosmos, with neither Good nor Evil entirely in the "right." Dragonlance didn't really use the Law-Chaos axis, though.</p>

<p>I think 2nd edition designers in particular often forgot what alignment meant, which is why we see it used in less appropriate contexts like Dark Sun (though not in other TSR roleplaying games, so apparently all the TSR designers saw it as a D&amp;D convention only, not something essential to all RPGs). </p>

<p>But I think my summary is where the concept of alignment came from, originating (I suppose) as opposing sides in Gygax's early wargames and drawing directly from the handful of fantasy novels that inspired the basis of D&amp;D's genre conventions.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I am quite certain that part of the original purpose of the alignments was to keep the player from 'powergaming' in certain ways by changing his behavior all the time.  (Although certainly in 2E, and I think 1E, there were a lot of rules for how your alignment could change over time, and many spells, etc. would mention that using them, or at least using them for certain purposes, had alignment penalties.)  It also set to place behavioral restrictions on certain character classes (most notably the Paladin and Ranger, and to a lesser extent the Druid, Rogue, and Assassin)</p>

<p>Another major purpose for alignment was to determine how monsters and NPCs react to the players.  In 1E it was prettymuch impossible to negotiate with an evil-aligned monster of any kind.  They want to either kill or enslave you, and you're not going to change their minds.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>Hyena of Ice</em> wrote:</div>e.g. in the Book of Exalted Deeds, it describes how torture is a good act if it is used in a ticking-timebomb scenario against evil-aligned beings.</div></p>

<p>Wait, what?  I just reread BoED the other day, and it specifically says that torture is under no conditions a good act, regardless of situation.  From page 9:</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>When do good ends justify evil means to achieve them?  Is it morally acceptable, for example, to torture an evil captive in order to extract vital information that can prevent the deaths of thousands of innocents?<p>
...</p><p>
In the D&amp;D universe, the fundamental answer is no, an evil act is an evil act no matter what good result it may achieve....Whether or not good ends can justify evil means, they certainly cannot make evil means any less evil.</p><p>
...</p><p>
Some good characters might view a situation where an evil act is required to avert a catastrophic evil as a form of martyrdom: "I can save a thousand innocent lives by sacrificing my purity."</p><p>
...</p><p>
Unfortuantely, this view is ultimately misguided....it is not a personal sacrifice, but a concession to evil, and thus unconscionable.
</div></p>

<p>As for your examples of pot smoking and pica, it seems like you're a little confused.  The fact that there exist drugs the use of which are evil, and diseases that cause people to eat inedible things, does not mean that all examples are naturally evil as well.  To give an example in real life, I'd certainly say that the use and especially the destribution of heroin, meth, and other such drugs that literally ruin lives are evil acts, but that doesn't mean that all drugs are.  The same applies to the drugs given in BoVD, unless it explicitly says at some point that all drugs, or some pot-equivalent, are naturally evil, which I would be very surprised to see but if you have a citation for it, I'd definitely be happy to see it.</p><p></p>

<p>And as for pica, all that means is there are certain diseases that cause people to consume inedible things as a side effect that are also evil in origin.  This does not preclude the existence of diseases that cause people to consume inedible things that are not evil in origin.  Again, unless the book outright says that all such diseases are naturally evil, you're overreaching your conclusions.</p></p> <div class="dice_rolls">
