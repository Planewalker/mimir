</div> <table>		<tr><td>Personality: These tieflings are about as common as those of Tanar'ri descent. Many of these tieflings live in denial of their heritage fearful of their malevolent ancestors. They're known for their paranoia and distrust of others. Many of them keep to close knit reclusive groups in an effort to defend themselves from the dangers of suspicious humans and the like. Tealo Wilton: &quot;The fear that these children have of their Baatezu ancestors is certainly well justified. These cruel Angels use their partially mortal offspring for purposes of their own. And like any others they know just how to make their children break to their will.&quot;While they may have more of a sense of community compared to other tiefling types that doesn't exactly make them anymore lawful than other races. These tieflings learn that others aren't to be trusted well, however since others don't trust them, it's completely acceptable to deceive others. To a Baatezu tiefling only other tieflings are worthy of their respect, but that's not always the case as some they are likely to join bitter gangs of tieflings.By: Jason NgImported from a previous version of Planewalker.com </td></tr>		<tr><td>Physical Description: Like other tieflings their appearance vary depending on what caste of Baatezu they came from. In most cases the influence of their ancestors is a subtle effect on their appearance, but there have been more extreme cases. The descendants of Lemures and Nupperibos (normally thought to be infertile) tend to have various physical deformities, usually with slightly misshapen body parts or various boils, some of them might also appear burnt. The children of Spinagons are typically short and have an impish look to them. Abishai spawn inherit some reptilian and gargoyle-like qualities and usually have a skin colour corresponding to white, black, green, blue and red of their ancestors caste. Barbazu children, tend to be bluish and more orcish in appearance often with a tell-tale beard. Kocrachon descendants have chitinous skin with often long snouts. Erinyes kin are attractive in appearance much like their ancestors. Those descended from Osyluths are often emaciated and tend of have scorpion-like tales (tough not necessarily with a stinger). Hamatula descendants are typically large with some barb like ridges across their bodies. Narzugon tieflings look a lot much Narzugons themselves, they look like gaunt pale gray humanoids. Amnizu kin are often short and squat with various warts and leathery skin. Cornugon descendants are either quite normal looking or quite scaly. Gelugon children are insectoid in appearance and are always cold to touch. And finally the children of Pit Fiends usually look like typical humanoids except they often have features such as wings, a tail, horns and eyes that glow red. </td></tr>		<tr><td>Relations: Gangs among tieflings are a more than common occurrence, especially these tieflings. While others often join gangs for survival, they also join for a sense of belonging they desire. As members of gangs they usually involve themselves in bitter rivalries against each other. In many groups they often serve as the brains behind the operation, however they lack the manipulative presence their Yugoloth spawned kin have. The taint of their ancestors causes a more uneasy presence among others, including their own kind. Janus Nguyen: &quot;They would have to bring up the subject of tieflings and gang violence... Perhaps the rest of you should know that most tieflings regardless of type don't do that sort of thing.&quot; </td></tr>		<tr><td>Alignment: Lawful Good</td></tr>		<tr><td>Lands: none</td></tr>		<tr><td>Religion: none </td></tr>		<tr><td>Language: none</td></tr>		<tr><td>Names: Like most tieflings they adapt the names of other cultures</td></tr>		<tr><td>Male Names: none</td></tr>		<tr><td>Female Names: none</td></tr>		<tr><td>Family Names: none</td></tr>		<tr><td>Adventurers: none </td></tr>		<tr><td>Racial Traits: ? +2 dexterity, +2 intelligence, -2 charisma ?
