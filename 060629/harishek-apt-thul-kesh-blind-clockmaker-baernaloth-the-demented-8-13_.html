And what I have dreaded has happened to me.I am not at ease, nor am I quiet; I have no rest, fortrouble comes." </span><cite><span>Job 3:25,26</span></cite></em></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>The elder Ratatosk stood and looked down at the clouds that swirled below him down the vast trunk of the World Tree, Yggdrasil, the Great Mother of his people. One of the so-called squirrel folk who populated the limbs and branches of their plane spanning home, he had lived nearly a century, his fur streaked with lines of gray, and he was feeling his age now like never before. It was growing time again as it always did. Their duty to the Great Mother was paramount above all things, even their own lives, which they willingly would give in Her defense. But the pain of that sacrifice at times was great enough to make him wonder if it was worth it what they did, if it was too hasty, or if there might be another way.</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>He sat down on the branch and waited for the arrival of those who he knew would be coming shortly, knowing or unknowing, they always came when time was due and what was necessary would be done. Good, evil, chaos, law it didn’t matter to him and his people, only their Great Mother who created and sheltered them mattered. She was them and they were her in so many ways, leaves and fruit upon the trunk that created them, fed them, and they in turn watched over her. But sometimes…</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>He shuddered and wept, a single tear dropping from his eye and falling down the miles to strike ground on one of the planes that the World Tree touched with its branches and roots. As the single drop of saline spread down the miles and froze in the passing air, the elder remembered the tale told to him by his grandfather five times over before that one’s passing, a tale passed down the generations from time unknowable to when the Great Mother was first injured.</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>The branches had shaken, the Mother had trembled and her pain was felt keenly by Her children when the Serpent had coiled about Her base with its unending hunger and rage, seeking to destroy the World Tree in the hopes of destroying the universe that had created it. The blood of the Great Mother had flowed in rivers in those days as Nidhogg clawed and ravaged the roots of the Tree where they had sunk into the soil of the Waste.</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>The Ratatosks had been helpless, for nothing they did could harm the Wyrm, and it ignored them while spawning its own children with the fiends of the lower planes and evil dragons who flocked to its call. It and its brood seemed like they might succeed in killing the Great Mother, and they, the Ratatosks, they wept in their impotence.</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>But salvation came to them unasked for, but needed, and wrapped in nightmare. His people had never spoken its name since that time, neither in thanks nor in fear, but its existence still haunted them through the millennia. They had never written it down, but somehow they all knew its name. They had never drawn it, nor carved it, nor passed down tales that described the Horror than was the giver of the salvation of they and their Great Mother, but still they knew its face in their nightmares and when the time came for their bargain to be paid again, they all would dream of it, hearing its whispers in the darkness.</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>The Elder looked down and sighed, knowing how close that time was, and the dreams that had come the night before like a black winged angel, one wing dipped in blood and the other glowing with their love for the World Tree. And he, one chosen of his generation, the first in many years, would go willingly with whatever would come in the following days. He and the others they did so with a glad heart, knowing that it was necessary.</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>Those old tales of that first meeting, the elders of a hundred hundred villages, the leaders and wise ones of their race who had gathered to discuss their last attempts of desperation to stop the Wyrm that feasted upon the Great Mother. They had been desperate, willing to do anything to save all that they knew, everything they cared for, and everything that they knew. Desperation was all they knew at that moment. Somehow their anguish, frustration, fear and misery was heard, and something came to save them, but not out of mercy…</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>The elder shuddered at what had been implied in the latter half of that tale. That it might not have heard them and come to save them, but had waited till their fear had collapsed into desperation and they no longer cared what they would have to give of themselves to save what they loved. The darkness that had blindly clambered up the trunk of the World Tree and offered them a way to save the Great Mother. </font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">“We agreed… we willingly agreed…” The Elder said out into the void beyond the branches as he cried once more, a broken man who had long ago resigned himself to the cross that he would willingly bear if the darkness came to give its bloody and poisoned salvation once again. “It always does, and we agreed, we willingly agreed…”</font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">****</font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>The six stood before the open gate and glanced at one another with a mixture of bravado, hesitancy, and worry tinged with necessity. The swirling gate burrowed a hole through the planes, nearly across the whole breadth of the multiverse, there from the Outlands and into the depths of the deep ethereal where the demiplane of time beckoned them.</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>They did not hazard the storms of that pocket dimension without need or cause, and they had only considered the trip due to having reached an impasse in a quest of their own that was largely unconnected with the demiplane. They needed to discover a method of understanding and deciphering the dread and nonsensical operation of a device in the Gray Waste known only as the Oblivion Compass. Nestled in a valley on Oinos, the bizarre and sprawling machine seemed to jut from the soil of the plane itself with ancient and rusting mechanisms that still ran smoothly and coldly with a progression and purpose shrouded, but born of nightmares. The device within that desolate valley somehow held a way of determining events key to their larger aims and goals, their own holy quest in a manner of speaking.</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>But, holy quest or not, the motley group of six seemed hardly a group to typify anything holy whatsoever. There was the half-fey bladesinger, known half-jokingly as Clueless; prone to good one moment, and cold, machiavellian rationality the next. A decidedly neutral being with his black, iridescent, dragonfly wings betraying a fey heritage that was unquestionably Unseelie. There was Toras, the half-celestial fighter and servant of Andros, an obscure deity from Ysgard, a protector of children, the weak and infirm. Though sometimes overzealous in his methods, the warrior was true to his patron’s goals.</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>Next there was Tristol Starweather, the aasimar mage from a wizard nation on the prime world of Abeir-Toril whose vulpine tail and ears betrayed his guardinal descent. Still, his heritage aside, his hunger for magic and his upbringing had instilled in him a largely ambivalent personal attention to good and evil. All said, he was more attuned to the goals of his own goddess of magic than to the multiversal conflict of good and evil.</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>Standing next to the wizard was his wife, Nisha Starweather, a quirky and spontaneous tiefling rogue who dabbled in some magic herself, but dabbled more in Xaos than anything else. But, as much as she might have typified a member of her faction, she was good at heart nearly as much as she was random.</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>Standing almost apart from them was a relative newcomer to their fold, a blond haired cleric of Brigit and member of the Ring Givers, Aiden. Though good and serving a goddess of good, he was, more often than not, prone to revelry and charity more for the gifts it brought, than out of a purely noble desire for good.</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>Finally though, standing opposite the half-fey like a bookend of neutrality to cap off their party and define its character, was the fallen lupinal, Fyrehowl. The lupine humanoid exemplar of pure good was, in many ways, jaded and disillusioned rather than fallen. She had long ago lost the idealism of her race, and lost faith in her race’s ability to do what needed to be done. Since her fall from grace, she had adopted the philosophy of the Transcendent Order and preferred to think that she was simply doing what had to be done, what was, on the grand order of things, the proper action to do at the proper time. Her own race, in her opinion, had spent too long pondering what to do without ever acting.</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>Through various unsavory routes, long examination of obtuse lore of the planes, and perhaps in no small measure a hunch, they sought out a location deep within the demiplane of time. A stable bubble within the roaring and unending storms of the temporal plane, almost a demiplane within a demiplane. They had spoken at length to a wizard known only as the Sapphire Mage in his floating tower at the edges of the demiplane itself, and asked for his advice upon entering the plane. Finally, given his own experiments with broaching the borders of the fickle and dangerous demiplane, they now stood at the open end of Tristol’s gate into the plane’s interior in order to avoid physically breaking the barrier themselves. Whether it would work or not remained to be seen.</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In the space of seconds they were through the gate, and its burst of utter cold, as they burrowed into the depths of the trackless sea of the deep ethereal, far from the shores and shallows that surrounded the prime, and down to the waiting darkness of the Demiplane of Time. They emerged into madness.</font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>All around them raged a storm to dwarf any hurricane of the prime, and winds to make the screaming of Pandemonium seem like a spring breeze. Glowing, burning lines of copper and gold, blue and red, erupted from each of them and spiraled out of sight into the maelstrom. Legends claimed that the lines represented the timeline of a person, their past and future, with themselves tethered to the present, and that to wander along it would lead them to either of those two destinations. But such idle speculation on the legends of the plane was gone after barely a moment when Tristol teleported them all through the near infinite stretch of the demiplane and into the stable bubble that seemed to hold their destination, and perhaps promised to hold their desired answers.</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>Once again there was a sudden wash of cold over their senses before they reappeared, but unlike before there was a sharp tugging sensation immediately before they passed into the interior of the Clockwork Gap.</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>Nisha blinked as they reappeared, then looked over at Tristol. “Umm… you’re off.

Stretching out before them was a massive, labyrinthine hedge maze that surrounded a large, several story fortress or keep at the very center of the disk. The keep itself seemed to hover slightly above a hole cut into the rocky disk, situated above a swirling morass of ethereal mist that glowed with an almost blinding intensity: an ether gap.</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>“No, we didn’t miss anything, we were redirected by whatever made this place.” Tristol said as he stared at the ether gap in the center of the domain. Whatever it was, the gap was truly massive, easily larger than any other such gap they had ever encountered, and it seemed perched on the edge of either expansion or utter collapse.</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>“And honestly, I’m not sure what’s frightening.

I can’t even tell you what school of magic it belongs to, if that would even apply to it really. It feels… wrong… but that’s all I can gather really. It doesn’t want to be seen, and for whatever reason, I’m not seeing it when I should.”</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>Taking the mage’s words into account they collectively looked up at the black marble archway that stood above the entry into the mazework of hedges. A single, carved refrain stretched across the stone, written in obscene letters only vaguely reminiscent of the written tongues of the fiends: Baernaloth.</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>“Anyone care to translate?” Toras asked.</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>The moment he posed the question though, the letters seemed to warp and ripple, like the pitch black stone was made of liquid, and then it was replaced with the same refrain, written in a mixture of infernal and abyssal.</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span><em>“What you can see can kill you.

They felt watched constantly as they walked, and the interior of the maze seemed to twist the concept of space itself as they found that any attempt to fly above the maze, or to pass through its walls by any but the obvious routes provided to them ultimately proved fruitless.</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>Regardless, they passed through a series of puzzles, based upon their own experiences, and others that seemed designed to test their concepts of morality and their own intelligence.

Curious, Nisha approached the first of four doors and swung it open without warning. The tiefling blinked and stepped back. Beyond the open door was a solid expanse of clockwork from wall to wall that blocked entry into the chamber except to watch and observe the gears, counterweights and pendulums all clicking along in sterility.</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>“Strange…” Clueless said as he swung open the second door and looked into a round chamber that resembled a laboratory. The walls were covered in glowing script in the same bizarre language they had seen upon the archway leading into the maze, but this time the language did not translate itself for them to read. The center of the room was dominated by a metallic pedestal that held a dozen or so leathery eggs in a field of purple light. Inside the eggs, heavily backlit by the glow to the point of translucency moved black, shadowy forms, very obviously alive.</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>“What the hell?” Fyrehowl said as she and the others glanced at the eggs and the rambling notations scrawled upon the walls.</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>When they entered the chamber, the things in the eggs seemed to take notice and move to face them; it was unsettling to say the least.

The chamber was lined with individual cages wrought of some black metal, carved with runes and symbols and each holding a single warped and twisted individual that by all rights should not have existed or should not have been alive.</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>“Mystra forbid…” Tristol muttered in shock as he looked into the first cage and the occupant that seemed to have been the result of either a forced attempt at breeding a Vrock and a Hamatula together, or the sorcerous fusion of the two.</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>The lupinal stared for a moment at the other cages within the room before turning away, feeling sick. Various other Baatezu and Tanar’ri hybrids, fusions, or grafting attempts were locked within the cages and tanks situated within the room. Volumes of notes were written upon the walls and stacked out of reach of the twisted, sickly occupants who seemed to exist in a state of constant agony, each of them kept alive only by magical interference.</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>Nisha turned a slight shade of green more than her already olive toned skin and walked out into the hall, soon to be joined by the others. The lupinal looked at them, “After that I’m not sure I care to know what’s in the other room…”</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>“Yeah, but I’m curious.

Several crystalline tanks held what could only have been described as trial runs and false starts along the way of creating a Mezzoloth. Dozens of books and tomes lay stacked on shelves between two dissecting tables, both of which held magically constrained and still living subjects. One table held a gutted, mewling and struggling Mezzoloth, each of its organs separated out, tagged and levitating slightly above its torso. The fiend was still alive despite the dissection.</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>The second table held a series of still living saggital and coronal slices of a canoloth, somehow kept animate and alive by magic, and a nearly solid illusion of a whole example of the subspecies in smaller scale.</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>Nisha gagged and dashed from the chamber when the sectioned eye of the dissected yugoloth turned to look at them. The others followed soon after, though Tristol stayed just a second more to note the sheer size of the notebooks littering the room. Each of them was easily four times the size of his own spellbooks, and that worried him simply on the matter of how physically large the author would have to have been.</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>They shook away the images still lingering in their heads of what they had seen on display, and walked deeper into the keep. As they strode onwards, they began to notice that the ubiquitous ticking of the clockwork devices echoing throughout the halls was not as constant as it first had seemed. In fact the pattern and rhythm of ticking would pause, reverse, increase or decrease in volume, and spontaneously change frequency and pattern. What was more, the changes they noticed were not always the same for each of them.</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>Fyrehowl’s ears perked at each of the changes, and the motion of her ears was not directly corresponding to that of Tristol’s ears, and he noticed it as well. “You’re not hearing the same patterns that I am, are you?” He asked.</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>“Doesn’t seem that way.” She replied.</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>“Nisha?

Is it whatever, not it that’s. … Whoops, sorry, bad habit.” She said as they drew near to a large, vaulted chamber.</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>They stopped in amazement and looked up at a series of steel and silver astrolabes that stood at the compass points in the chamber, each of them with several great crystal lenses focused on some distant scene. While half of the lenses seemed inactive at the time, others opened up onto a scene within the ethereal plane. One by one they saw moving images of Lycester’s Gap, the White Ship, the Pyramidal Gap, and the ethereal protomatter comet that hurtled through the depths, studded with shapes reminiscent of buried cities, known only as the Body Luminous.</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>Each scene would pan, focus on minor details of each, and then draw out from each scene before repeating once more. Then the ticking stopped, the scenes dimmed and paused, and the inactive lenses rotated and glowed with activity.</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>“This can’t be good…” Nisha said with a wince.</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>“It’s not…” Fyrehowl said as she glanced around nervously.</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>The newly active crystal lenses then showed their contents, each a series of grim and morbid potential futures: Toras watched in one lens as he was torn to pieces by a pack of invisible beasts. Fyrehowl watched as she was devoured by fiends. Nisha watched as she slipped and was ground to meat inside the gears of one of the astrolabes. Scene by scene the lenses played out a dozen or more grim fates, and eventually the six of them stopped watching and continued walking after they watched a scene where they all killed one another.</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>“Someone’s having fun at our expense.” Aiden said with a smirk.</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>“No, what I worry about is that each of those was an actual possible future, however bizarre and remote.” Clueless said.</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>The next twenty minutes were filled only with their own lurking dread at what they might find at the center of the fortress, and the constant ticking of the clockwork that seemed to fill the spaces between the walls.

The air was still and cold, but skirting the edge of their hearing was the combined chorus of innumerable whispers that rushed forth from the swirling ether gap at the very center of the room that opened up below a circular portal nearly thirty feet across. Above the swirling ethereal abyss like a giant iron spider was a great clockwork device of gears, pendulums, and crystalline lenses that hovered and shuddered with its own infernal motions above the pit. Extending out up and across the room with iron rods and spinning gear work, it was eerily silent except for the subsonic vibrations that ran through their bodies with the whir and clatter of a hundred thousand maddeningly spinning and grinding gears.</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>But the insensate, unspeakably complex device was not what drew their attention immediately. Rather, it was the creature that peered out at them from behind the machine, standing at the edge of the pit. Nearly twenty feet tall with wasted, elongated limbs, the Baernaloth turned at their approach and flashed a grin of yellowed but razor sharp fangs. It sniffed at the air as it noticed them and flicked it blackened tongue at the air like a serpent, and then they all noticed its eyes.</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>The monstrous fiend’s eyes were clouded and opaque, blind and unseeing as they randomly twitched in their sockets, wandering and not focused on them as the fiend blindly felt its way along the edge of the pit by taking hold of the iron device like a guide rail. “It certainly took you long enough to find your way here, though time is entirely subjective in this place.

The World Tree rose out of sight into the wispy, mournful clouds that hung above the layer of Niffleheim, a thing of plane spanning greatness, somehow drawing sustenance from the frigid dark of the second Gloom.

Where the tree met the horizon, the tail and part of a wing of the mother of dragons itself lay upon the Waste amid a river of sticky, slowly flowing sap. Nidhogg’s tail twitched in irritation every few minutes and they could feel the earth shake ever so slightly from miles away as it vented its apocalyptic desires upon Yggdrasil’s roots.</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>“Let’s just pour this vial out before that thing or any of its children notices us, alright?” Clueless said.</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>“Sneaky would be good right now.

Perched upon a branch high above them and looking down was a solitary woman of fey or vaguely half-elven features. Her hair was long and green, tinged with the red of autumn in places, and her skin was a milky nut brown.

Yggdrasil wept. Far below, on another plane or two or three, her tears would fall like glistening raindrops upon the ground and sprout spontaneously into saplings and flowers which then withered and died, blooming and passing in an instant, evaporating in the sunlight or the gloom where they might touch the earth. Yggdrasil wept.</font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">***</font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Hours passed as they walked along the tree as the vial led them along, sometimes walking along or between branches, other times flying up the trunk. Several times they would encounter other travelers along the branches, some of them benign and others hostile, most of them using the tree as a method of transit between planes. They would pass some of the portals that dotted the limbs of Yggdrasil like fruit, great spinning pools of light to the other planes where the tree touched with stem or root.

At that moment, timed for the worst, they passed by the chambers that had held the Clockmaker’s twisted experiments and gruesome displays, and at that moment the doors swung wide open. The moans, shrieks and other noises from the still living abominations reached out into the hallway and the children went pale at what they saw. Clueless, Tristol and Aiden quickly clasped their hands over the children’s eyes and ears to shelter them from the assault as they hurriedly moved them down the passageway. Minutes later, as they were still cursing the Baernaloth’s sick pleasure and still trying to comfort the little ones, the central chamber loomed before them.</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>The ratatosk elder was whispering a prayer to Yggdrasil as they stepped into the massive, cathedral-like vault with its bizarre clockwork device perched atop the swirling core of the ether gap. The Baernaloth was not present as they stepped hesitantly towards the center of the room. All they heard was the echoes of their footsteps, the maddening whispers from the swirling whirlpool of ether, and the cold grinding of the clockwork.</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>They had fully entered the room, standing next to the massive device, when they all turned to look back at the entrance, half expecting the door to be gone, or the Baernaloth standing there. There was nothing when they turned and looked, but then one of the children screamed in horror.</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>The Clockmaker stood only scant feet from them, its hands clutching the device above the gap to steady itself, and its blind eyes wide with anticipation. It’s yellowed teeth shown as it grinned widely and sniffed at the air. The ratatosk elder stumbled backwards and fell to the ground in shock at the size of the fiend, its composition ripped from his nightmares and the stories of his race. The blind darkness leered down at him and the three terrified children.</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>“We’ve brought what the Ratatosk’s gave to us. They came willingly. We wouldn’t have forced them.” Tristol said angrily. “I hate you for this. I hate you for making us do this for our answers from you…”</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>The Baernaloth didn’t seem to care one way or the other as it paused and sent it mind flowing across the chamber to brush against the fearful thoughts of the seven that stood there before it. Harishek tilted his head in either curiosity or irritation as it noted that Toras, Nisha, and Fyrehowl had not returned with the others.</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">“Only three of you… the godslave, the godpuppet and the halfbreed. Where are the idealist fool, the elysian filth, and the chaos touched bitch?” The Baern looked in Tristol’s direction as he sneered the last name, turning back for a moment to fumble with and adjust the gears of the massive device that sat above the gap.</font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">“You said we could leave the deal at any point without retribution or breaking the agreement. They couldn’t justify this…” The Archmage’s voice trembled slightly with emotion and the Ratatosk child clutched at his leg, cowered in fear. “I can’t fully justify what I’m doing, what you’ve made me do, and I will regret this and seek atonement and forgiveness for the rest of my life. The only thing that makes it ache less is that I might save more people by doing this, and that the Ratatosks give of themselves willingly to preserve their Great Mother as an act of worship. I cannot fathom the sacrifice they put upon themselves out of love for Yggdrasil, nor can I fathom the evil that would make you enjoy your deal with them…”</font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The Gloom Father smiled and laughed, “So I did say that, promised you an answer… as for the bargain they and I made, some things happen because they must. Accept that mortal and live your life under all those moral pretenses you hold onto. Nothing comes without sacrifice. For anything to happen, anything great to happen, there must be two things: blood and terror.” The Clockmaker paused and turned its sightless eyes towards the elder Ratatosk. “We are well acquainted with both…”</font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The Baern stepped closer to the elder ratatosk as the children whimpered in abject horror, clutching onto Clueless, Tristol and Aiden. “Uncover their eyes. Make them watch this.”</font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Looks of revulsion crossed the faces of the three and they paused and did nothing. The Baern slowly snarled, “Do as I command or I shall force it upon them myself mortals!”</font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Slowly and with an ache in their souls they complied, turning the ratatosk children towards their elder, uncovering their eyes and holding them up to see what would follow.</font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The Baern looked down towards the adult ratatosk, his eyes unfocused and wandering in their blindness before he snatched the elder up with one hand around its neck. “Give me the vial now and watch closely for what your sacrifice begets you.”</font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Aiden handed the Baern the empty vial and the fiend flicked one finger and it hovered in the air near the Ratatosk in its grip. The elder struggled for air before the hand around its neck was released and he hung suspended in space, still gasping for breath as his previous resignation broke and was replaced with whimpering fear. The Baern seemed to revel in the change in his spirits as it broke into a wide, almost ecstatic smile and the elder began to writhe and scream in agony. The children and the three could only watch, compelled to witness the torture of the ratatosk suspended before them. </font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">He screamed and his limbs jerked, spasmed and danced as if on invisible puppet strings while his body was struck by such pain that his back arched and seemed at the verge of snapping from the tension. And then it did, with a sickening snap, as first one vertebra and then another and another in turn broke and cracked from the torment. Bones along the length of the elder’s body shifted internally and seemed to shatter and contort beyond their natural limits as the Baern broke him in every sense of the word. He should have died from the damage, he should have felt less pain as his spine broke in half, but he screamed till his vocal chords bled and tore and silenced his agony into bloody gurgles. </font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">With each scream a tiny sparkle of light sprang from his own mouth, eyes and nostrils to flicker on the air and fly into the vial hanging in the space next to him. When his screams finally stopped, his eyes glazed over in death, and his body crumpled to the floor with a sickening crunch, the vial was ¼ full. And the three children remained. Ten minutes that hellish execution passed and the children had to watch it all. A harbinger of their own fate…</font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The Baern seemed pleased with himself as he crouched next to the body and pawed with outstretched hands before finding it and dragging it close. He sniffed at the ragged corpse and turned it face up before glancing back up towards the children and the three companions who had brought them to their doom. “Send the children over into one of the corners, I will deal with them later.”</font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The three put the children down and walked them over into one of the corners of the room. All three of them were pale and shaking, crying out with raw voices, tiny streaks of tears working down their cheeks. They should not have ever been there…</font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>“I’m so sorry…” Clueless whispered as he put down the orphan. “You three are strong and so very brave. Whatever happens, we’ll remember you and make sure that your people do as well. You can do this.” The bladesinger then had to force himself to walk away, leaving his child to her fate.</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Glancing back to the children, their hearts screaming at them to do something other than leave them, the three walked back and past the Clockmaker as it hunched over the elder’s broken body. There was a tearing sound followed by a crunch as the Clockmaker picked up the corpse and began to devour it.</font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">“You promised me some answers to a few questions. How do I read the Oblivion Compass?” Tristol asked the Baernaloth with a hint of defiance in his voice, his loathing for the fiend not disguised in the least.</font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">“Did I?” There was another crunch as the fiend’s naked incisors snapped through the elder’s ribcage to rip out muscle and viscera that it chewed upon noisily. “I seem to recall having said I would tell you when the clock would strike 11, not how to read it yourself. You demand much godpuppet.” Another bloody crunch.</font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">“The clock will strike 11 in two weeks, three days, five hours, four minutes and 3 seconds from now.” The fiend snapped two fingers at the final word of its declaration and glanced in Tristol’s direction again, chewing upon a hunk of muscle from the corpse. “You still wish to know how to read the clock yourself?”</font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">“Yes…” He replied angrily.</font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The Baern chewed its mouthful of bloody flesh, mixing it with syrupy black mucous before it pulled forth a gobbet of the mass forth and held it up in the palm of its hand towards Tristol. “Eat…”</font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Tristol grimaced and took the bloody handful without a word. He shuddered as he put it into his own mouth, chewed it twice and swallowed it. He looked sick but otherwise did nothing. The Baern sneered up at him, “You’re as much a fool as I thought. But now as for your answer…”</font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Tristol nearly fell to the ground as for the briefest of seconds the sightless eyes of the Baern seemed to lock onto him and focus as the Clock Maker’s mind forced itself into his like a burning hot spike of iron. A flood of images rushed into his head from the fiend: images of modrons being welded into place on the compass, the horrified Secundus screaming in agony as it was fused, still living, into the nightmare engine, the moignos being bound into the device’s core, a flurry of chaotic nonsensical mathematical equations and the horrid spinning of the gears and hands upon the face of the machine. And suddenly some pattern seemed to emerge from it all and he understood at least some method of understanding the patterns of it all, if not the purpose.</font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The Baernaloth laughed harshly at the aasimar while it drew forth a length of slippery innards from the partially devoured corpse like a glistening string of popcorn. “You could always spare the children the pain that will come to them you know…”</font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Tristol stood up and narrowed his eyes, still staggered from his experience of absorbing a memory from the Clockmaker. “What do you mean? How?”</font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The Baern chewed on the bloody loop of intestines and then looked over at the whimpering children. “Kill one of them now. Kill one of them with your bare hands. Snap their neck with one clean motion and give them a quick death, a merciful passing into oblivion. You may kill one of them now and spare them the experience at my delicate hands…”</font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>The fiend punctuated his offer by unfolding its hands as if offering up a sacrifice, the slim, clawed digits drenched in gore. “And your answer?”</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>“No…” Tristol said abruptly and angrily. “I’ve already condemned them to death as it is, and I simply can’t live with anything else on my conscience.

And while those other futures were not to be, this one is, and I promised you no harm and an answer to a question. I provide both because it suits my wishes in what is to come.

I’ve had my fun with most of you.”</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Tristol said nothing, but motioned towards Aiden and Clueless to leave. However as he began to incant the words to bring them to the Outlands he felt the Baernaloth’s blind eyes seem to focus on him, or at least its mind brush against him as it muttered softly, “Oh what your timelines say…and what they do not…”</font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>Tristol grimaced in disgust as he stepped through his gate and emerged out into the Outlands.

The two of them do possess similar qualities, though The Architect seems to give to others the methods and insights of their own destruction, praying off of the desire to create, feeding off of the ego and pride of humanity. The Architect may represent the darkness of the creative spark when consumed by pride, wisdom subsumed by ego, and the unrelenting desire to mold the world around us without regard for any save ourselves. Differing from this, The Blind Clockmaker, while also a creator in the same sense as Lazarius Ibn Shartalan, he seems to resemble the slow, faceless, unyielding progression of evolution as the strong and fit overwhelm the weak. Perfection devoid of mercy, survival by sacrifice, blood spilt upon the altar of time to cull the unfit, blood spilt even if it might not be necessary.</font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>Harishek Apt Thulkesh is also known as the Exile, though in his case his exile is willing and purposeful, unlike the forced banishment of Apomps the Triple-Aspected. The Clockmaker has at times referred to another member of The Demented, Daru Ib Shamiq, the ‘Lie Weaver’, as being his ‘brother’. Now while the Baern refer to one another as siblings, as brothers and sisters, the Clockmaker uses a specific term in its own infernal language that puts some level of subtle distinction between the kinship between the Lie Weaver and himself and that between the other 11 of their cabal and he. The exact nature of this relationship is unknown, and since the Baernaloth are all unique, individual creatures, all presumed to have existed since the initial moments of their plane’s creation, and devoid of any known instance of sexual reproduction, blood relation is a rather improper term to use. </font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">What’s more, is that the term the Clockmaker uses for the Lie Weaver has been reported in two forms, seemed to encompass both brother and sister when he refers to the other Baernaloth. This is odd since the Lie Weaver has been reported to be distinctly male, while the Clockmaker has either no specific gender, or both at once, the exact state seeming to change from time to time without reason.</font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The Clockwork Gap :</font><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">The Clockwork Gap is something if an enigma, a demiplane within a demiplane, a point of stability within the eternal storms of the temporal energy plane itself. The demiplane itself is bound within an opaque boundary, much like the vaporous curtains of other demiplanes in the ethereal depths, and requires no key for entry.<p /></p></font></font></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>Once having braved the storms of the plane surrounding it, the interior of the demiplane is a hollow space of roughly 4 miles in circumference. Occupying the center of the demiplane is a disk or shelf of rock around a mile in diameter that is perched atop a massive whirlpool of ethereal protomatter, an ether gap. Though the disk itself seems unmoving and stable, anything not standing upon its surface experiences a slow but gradual pull from the gap, drawing them towards is unknown depths.<p /></p></font></font></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>The sole structure upon the disk is a single keep of dressed stone, unremarkable and otherwise of little note. Surrounding the keep is a massive hedge-maze, passage through which seems to be a requirement for accessing the keep itself and those who attempt to bypass the hedgemaze by magic or flying experience an odd phenomena of never growing near to the keep despite any effort they make. Those who brave the maze have spoken of ‘whispering figments’ and ‘living illusions’ populating the interior corridors of the hedges. The occupants of the maze seem drawn from the fabric of the minds of those wishing to gain access to the keep, and they are frequently challenged in some manner, or their thoughts and motivations explored by the illusory beings before ending up before the entrance to the castle.<p /></p></font></font></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>The interior of the keep has been detailed by those few travelers who managed to brave the dangers of the surrounding plane and return to tell the tale, and they, to a man, regret the experience, for something dwells within the keep that is the stuff of nightmares. Once beyond the exterior doors, the interior is cavernous and seemingly deserted, filled only by the ticking, unrelenting sound of mechanical gears and clockwork plodding along in the darkness like the whispers and footsteps of a hundred thousand fiends behind the walls lying in wait.<p /></p></font></font></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">Visitors describe hallways of empty chambers, rooms filled flush to their doors with gears and indecipherable mechanical objects of unknown purpose. They also describe the laboratories of mangled experiments, both preserved and living in various states of dissection, fiends all of them. Chamber after ghoulish chamber of warped and twisted Yugoloths, Baatezu, and Tanar’ri. Forced crossbreeds, magical fusions of the subjects, and bizarre mutations upon their standard forms, as well as what can only be described as ‘prototypes’ of the Mezzoloth, each stage of its design and creation detailed in voluminous notes in an obscure dialect of infernal. The workshop of a fiend filled with the half-starts, dead ends, and successes formed by tinkering upon a form, evolution enacted by force, and a blind, unfeeling progression of progress in the essence of the fiend’s creations.<p /></p></font></font></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>Wandering further through the halls visitors have discovered massive devices that they can only describe as planar orreries such as that created by the Modron deity Primus in Mechanus. These devices however appear to focus on distinct portions of the ethereal, the prime material, and within the demiplane itself. At erratic moments the devices give rise to images of current and past events at the location they are focused upon, as well as events within what have been guessed to be possible or alternate timelines.<p /></p></font></font></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>Those looking into the orreries have claimed to witness scenes of themselves being butchered by invisible beasts, with a lingering impression that something within the image is looking back at them through the massive devices before the images wink out. The experience is said to be harrowing, and most turn back upon witnessing such. But progressing towards the center of the demiplane within the keep, the surroundings grow more bizarre yet.<p /></p></font></font></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>Further reports of explorers tell that they encountered ephemeral images of themselves or alternate versions of themselves walking through the demiplane, unable to affect or communicate with these fragments of stillborn or collapsed timelines. These figments of things never to be frequently are observed to die spectacularly before fading from view.<p /></p></font></font></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>The center of the demiplane is a massive, cathedral-like chamber filled with a great clockwork device that sits perched above the lip of a circular hole in the floor of the keep. The shaft of the precipice looks down into the very maw of the ether gap beneath the surface of the rock upon which the keep itself rests. The swirling depths of the gap give rise to no images or beings, but a low and constant whispering drifts through the air like the death rattle of a world forever trapped in the last moment before oblivion. The whispers of the void, as unearthly and terrifying as they may seem, are nothing compared to the sole occupant and master of the Clockwork Gap.<p /></p></font></font></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>A twenty-foot tall, thin and wasted Baernaloth, its eyes milky and sightless within their orbits in its goat-like skull, a thing of living nightmare, occupies the central chamber. Those who have stood in the presence of The Blind Clockmaker tell of how it constantly adjusted and tinkered with the massive devices perched about the lip of the ether gap, whispering to itself, or the gap in an unknown language that ‘burned the senses with a feeling of wretched filth not easily cleansed’.<p /></p></font></font></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>Some have claimed that the gap spoke back directly to it, outside of the screams and insensate whispers that normally issue forth from its depths. This voice has always been ignored or mocked by the Clockmaker, and on several instances a spectral figure seemed to manifest out of the gap, clawing its way up from that swirling, misty abyss and stepping out into the chamber. Vague and largely undefined, it appears to have been incapable of acting in any physical manner outside of staring at the Baernaloth and exuding a sense of hatred. The Clockmaker returned the feeling with mutual glee, but never once referred to it by name or nature, simply as a being, or a wretch, or “dead probability, greatness lost in the tumble of the dice and gears of the universe of our molding”.<p /></p></font></font></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>Those who do not disturb the ancient Baernaloth may observe it for a time before it makes very clear that while its eyes are robbed of sight, it is far from unaware of those within its domain. It will frequently speak with, and even answer, questions posed to it by visitors, though any information it provides is never without a cost to the listener. Many have left, their minds enriched by the primal fiend’s wisdom, and their souls tarnished by its words and influence.<p /></p></font></font></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>The Blind Clockmaker is elusive about its reasons for inhabiting a demiplane of its own manufacture in the depths of the Temporal Energy plane, so far from its native home of the Gray Waste. But the being seems largely too preoccupied with its elusive tasks to actively harm any polite visitors, and it will offer information to them in exchange for the completion of tasks on its behalf. To a fault, the tasks will appear innocuous on the surface but result in morally repugnant situations that may strain a person into breaking their agreement with the Baern, or sullying their souls by the act’s completion.</font></font></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>In the end, the demiplane is a mystery even in a plane of such primal mysteries as the Temporal Energy Plane. It is ruled and occupied by a being of nearly godlike power with knowledge reaching back to the dawn of the fiends, and one that is willing to share its knowledge to those who seek it out, but that knowledge always carries a cost. Not all who enter the keep leave, and those that do are never whole in the same way as when they entered.<span><p /></p></span></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">The Clockwork Gap has the following traits:<p /></p></font></font></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">Normal Gravity<p /></p></font></font></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">Finite<p /></p></font></font></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">Timeless – Much like the Astral, time does not pass normally within the demiplane, though it retroactively catches up upon leaving.
