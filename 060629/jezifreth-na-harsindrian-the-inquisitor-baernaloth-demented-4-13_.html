So it’s pure and simple common sense: just don’t give them anything to drink.” – Alexander Solzhenitsyn, The Gulag Archipelago Vol 2, pp 495-496</em></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><em> <p /></p></em></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><em>“With an iron fist we will lead humanity to happiness.” – Sign above the entrance to Solovetsky prison, 1933</em></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><em><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"></font></em> </p><p class="MsoNormal"><em><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"></font></em> </p><p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><em><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">****</font></em></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span> </span>Was it a lie or was it the truth that flew from his lips? I looked at him, uncertain, for he was said to be a blasphemer against the light of our great order. There was an undercurrent of dissent and blasphemy against our great lord and lady, such as had not been seen for a thousand years since our faith brought unity to the five nations of our world.</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">But, this was the current, not the times of a thousand years ago. These people, myself included had never, till the present, known strife, hardship or disharmony. This was alien, unexpected, and thus we suspected some outside influence at first. We had not found any, but the strife among the people of our nations had grown rapidly under the festering stresses of political upheaval in the west and the economic hardship brought on by the mass crop failure and famine among the people of the east.</font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Here in the capital city of Serithes, jewel of the highland plateau, we had assumed ourselves free from the immediate ramifications. That was before plague struck our eastern cities with the influx of the starving, and then our king was deposed by his brother; said to have been a reaction to the deposed reagent’s intention to invade the west in order to shore up our faltering currencies.</font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The people had cried out to us, we of the holy order of the divine pair. They needed our spiritual guidance through these difficult times, and they wanted a reason for it. After all, we had not seen such strife in over a millennium. Things soon worsened, and with that, people’s faith wavered and some began to speak out against our truth, our light, and our divine compact with they, our flock.</font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">I was as shocked as my other brothers and sisters where when a treatise was printed and littered the streets of one of the eastern cities, from the doorsteps of the rich to the gutters below. The paper was filled with lies and half-truths. The lines of the papers claimed things about our faith that I will not repeat, may the divine pair shelter my soul. Blasphemy it was, but blasphemy that spoke into the hearts and minds of the weak and the uncertain. Those of wounded heart and mind, fearful what the future might bring, they listened, and the lies began to spread.</font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span> </span>“Find the source of this all” They told me and the others who were chosen by the most high of our faith. “Go out amongst the people, empowered to do all that you must, and find the source of these heresies. Expose them to the light of the sun and strike out at the lies they birth. You do this, and the rest of us shall win them back. Combined and by the grace of our twin creators we shall return the land to prosperity, and the souls of our flock to paradise.”</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">****</font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">I remembered those words as I stood outside the cell in which we had taken the accused. The man stood shackled within the cold stone interior, beyond the iron door, and I pondering the details of the case as I watched him through an eyehole.</font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><em>Will it be like last time?</em></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">My conscience seemed to ask me as I looked into the cell at the prisoner. It had been asking me the same question since I had started on the travel to this city, but now it seemed as if it was asking me like I would ask questions of the man in the cell.</font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">“I hope not on some level, and on another level I pray that it will.” I muttered to myself.</font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><em>The last time, the woman in the north: the child killer… you had to resort to violence then. Will you have to do the same now?</em></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">“I do what is needed.

Are you alright?” One of the guards hesitantly asked me.</font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">I regarded him askance, “Yes. Certainly. Why?”</font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">He bowed slightly, “You were talking to yourself…”</font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">“Contemplation and prayer. Nothing more. Be at ease my son.” That said, I walked into the cell and slowly walked a circle around the man that stood accused.</font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">His neighbors had spoken out against him, and they described a man who, having lost a son to plague, and his wife having killed herself shortly thereafter had turned to drink. In his depression it seemed as though he might have allowed such lies as had been said and whispered in the dark to cloud his judgment and worm there way into his heart like some fiendish parasite.</font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Still, I paced around him, uncertain to an extent as to his actual guilt. We had found several written pages of heretical work hidden upon his property, and though we had omitted what the actual contents of the box they were found in were, he claimed to have no idea of the existence of that hidden box or whatever was within. We had found some evidence of a gathering on his lands, perhaps dedicated to rights in the worship of some demon or fiend. However the man claimed it was only a bonfire to dispose of the carcass of a diseased calf, unfit for slaughter and unlikely to survive if released to the wild. Perhaps, but combined, it made him a suspect, and even if he was not the heart of such things, he could lead us to those who had whispered such lies to him in the first place.</font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">“I don’t know what in the name of the divine pair that you’re talking about.” He protested repeatedly. “My neighbors, they only want my land if I’m forced to admit to something I didn’t do. That’s all I have left. My son is dead, my wife too.”</font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">He was adamant in his innocence and of this claimed plot by his neighbors. They were pious folk; they had even donated a dozen cattle to the coffers of the church in recent weeks.</font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">We spoke for another three hours but he remained steadfast in his claims and I could detect no real inconsistencies in his story. The church had been largely certain of his guilt and I was only brought in as a formality to prove it and bear witness to his admission of it.

I frowned as I said my morning devotions, and I was struck with a resolute certainty to discover the truth on this new day.

He is open and blunt about who and what he is, and about what he wants from his victims, though he will often whisper to them in their sleep, or when they are alone and deep within their own thoughts. He may appear to them as their own introspection and doubts long before he takes physical form, and even then it may be some time before they realize that he was manifested himself.</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">When Jezifreth manifests in physical form, he appears in the standard form of one of the Baernaloths; twelve feet or so tall, wasted, sickly, and pale. However he varies from the standard form of his kind in the following, notable ways. His eyes are not the dead, white, snake-like eyes of many of his kind, but rather they take the form of burning, crackling cinders, igniting and glowing within his head, and casting a guttering and harsh light. His fingers are burnt down to the bone, the flesh blackened and roasted, ruined and claw-like. His body is covered in burn marks, bleeding lashes and puncture wounds; all of them the signs of prolonged and brutal torture. Upon his back, sprouting from the burned and cauterized flesh, protrude a series of slightly curved, white-hot iron spikes, sprouting down at an angle like porcupine quills. The fiend himself reflects what he is and his means of torment and pain, like his brethren the Flesh Render, he spares himself nothing in what he gives to the multiverse that he blights with his presence.</font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>The Inquisitor seems to derive both pleasure and purpose from the slow corruption of once holy women and men, especially those holding positions of power within established clerical hierarchies, and, to a lesser extent, secular authorities who hold power over large numbers of individuals, lawmakers, kings, nobility, judges, and keepers of information and official secrets. Almost exclusively, the subjects targeted by this particular member of The Demented, reside upon the infinite worlds of the prime material plane, rather than the outer, transitive, or inner. Perhaps this is because most mortals reside upon the prime, fit for corruption and capacity to do the most damage in the wake of his tender ministrations, or perhaps on the other planes the Inquisitor would dare the wrath and direct intervention of the powers; we suggest the latter.</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>To those of us who watch for the workings of such paragons of darkness, there is an order and rationale within the workings of the Inquisitor, or at least the glimmer of some order within those blasphemies. He is searching for something, and the corruption of mortals may be only the grisly side effect of his search rather than the goal or aim or it. While we are not privy to those sessions between he and his subjects, we suspect that his questions relate to the inner workings of their churches, details of their communication with their respective patron deities, and in the records of secular authorities regarding the histories of their nations and of the coming or religion to their domains.</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>In past millennia, the Inquisitor has seemed to particularly visit and question the faithful of those gods who are, in the Baern’s view of such time scales, soon to wither and die. Perhaps the fiend sees signs and portents of their eventual deaths, perhaps he only sees opportunity, or maybe some mixture of both in gripping upon the hope and desperation of the deity and its adherents, perceiving some weakness to exploit in search of his answers.</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>Oddly enough, the Inquisitor has snatched upon attempts to question the faithful of abstract concepts, the elemental gods, and even fiends raised to the status of true powers. This strikes us as strange, being that Jezifreth predates, massively so, almost all of these gods. Perhaps he is not interested in the gods themselves, but the process of how they arise, flourish and ultimately die. Perhaps the Baern perceives something else in the process beyond what we currently know of such things, and if so this raises a troubling possibility. Is there something that underlies the gods of the multiverse, something transcendent beyond the order and status quo of the gods, perhaps something of which they are all but aspects and fragments? After all, we know that worshippers of concepts and alignments, not actual gods, do receive spells by virtue of their belief. Even the Athar, who in their foolishness, desperation, or brilliant insight, see true divinity as beyond this existence, unknowable and beyond the gods, they are granted power by their belief.</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"> <p /></p></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>            </span>We know that the Baernaloths view the abstract concept of evil as a living being, though perhaps beyond our conception of life in the conventional sense. Perhaps they view the other alignments and even other beliefs and concepts which as opposed to this thing that they claim created them and sent them into the multiverse as heralds and servants, this thing that they worship. If so, than Jezifreth may be seeking out the signs and means by which these other transcendent forces act upon and touch our reality, if such a thing is true, if something else exists outside of what we know.</font></font></p></font></font></p>   </div>
