</div> <p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">&quot;This is bad. This is, in fact, the very definition of bad,&quot; Ben began, pacing back and forth near the crackling campfire. &quot;If there were some sort of book which contained within it the definition of words, and if we were to look up the word 'bad', we would find an exact description of this very situation under it.&quot;&quot;You're being over-dramatic,&quot; Jerald told him. He currently appeared as a sickening green troll dressed in ink-black spell-caster's robes and with his dark turquoise hair done back in dreadlocks. &quot;We can just bail.&quot;&quot;We can't just bail,&quot; Ben said, spinning around on the troll. &quot;I all ready accepted the money.&quot;&quot;Oh, really?&quot; Jaer, who was busy attempting to make a rock comfortable with one of the bedrolls the villagers had lent her, perked up considerably. &quot;Well, that's just dandy! We can run off with it, then.&quot;&quot;We're not running off with the money,&quot; Ben growled.</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">Marien's bleak voice rose above the argument. &quot;You know, we wouldn't be in this jam if you all had just listened to me.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Shut up!&quot; Ben snapped. &quot;Just shut up!&quot;&quot;You could give the money back and explain the situation.&quot;Four sets of eyes locked upon Jerum, who was whittling away at a burnt husk of wood he had snatched up on the way in the village. The red-headed stage-hand was smiling with a dismally blank smile that always struck Ben as creepy.</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">&quot;What?&quot; Ben asked, trying his best to stifle an incredulous squeak.</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Give the money back. Tell the truth. Apologize. They still have time to go back to Sigil and find real heroes,&quot; Jerum explained as he continued to whittle. &quot;No harm, no foul.&quot;&quot;That's...&quot; Ben began, searching for the right words.&quot;The smartest thing you've heard all day?&quot; Marien grumpily offered.</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">&quot;No, the absolute silliest,&quot; Jaer countered, puffing a lock of dark hair out of her eyes. &quot;You don't give money back after you've gotten it. Once we're gone for a few days, they'll figure things out, I'm sure.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Now, let's not be hasty here,&quot; Ben said, dropping down to a rock. &quot;I mean, maybe... uh... maybe we can pull this off...&quot;Jerald sniffed disdainfully. &quot;Oh, please. We're talking about adventurers, Ben. You know exactly what sort of fellows they are. Unreasonable louts with overwhelming power and absolutely no appreciation for fine theatre.&quot;&quot;That's true,&quot; Jerum said, smiling.</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Maybe... Maybe we can...&quot; Ben began as he propped his hand up in his chin. &quot;Maybe we can...&quot;&quot;Ask the Aasimar?&quot;Now five sets of eyes locked upon the speaker. Only this time, it was the withered old man who spoke, smiling a crooked smile that gained a menacing cast by the glow of the crackling fire.&quot;Uh, oh, hello, Old Man... We're just, ah, you know. Prioritizing. Preparing tactics, for the, uh, battle, and...&quot; Ben began.</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; The Aasimar nodded, pursing his lips in an authorative matter. &quot;Very important. Discussing strategies, plotting tactics, preparing for battle... All very good. Might I pull you away for a moment from your diligent work, however? I would like you to walk with me.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">Ben swallowed. Rising up to his feet, he moved to walk besides the old Aasimar.</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">-------------</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">&quot;I know you aren't Rin.&quot;&quot;Is it that obvious?&quot; Ben asked as the two of them - the old actor on one side, and the far older Aasimar on the other - circled around the village under the cloak of night.</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">&quot;I made the story up.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Excuse me?&quot; Ben gave a start.&quot;It was a long time ago,&quot; The Aasimar began, glancing up towards the starless sky. &quot;And I thought it was a very nice story. So I started telling people about it, and, well, it caught on.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">&quot;You expect me to believe-&quot;&quot;It doesn't matter what you believe,&quot; The Aasimar cut him off. &quot;All that matters is that I know you're not Rin, and I know that you're quite incapable of facing off against the adventurers who are coming in three weeks.&quot;Ben fell into a sullen silence. The old man finally broke it. &quot;But I also know that it doesn't matter.&quot;Confusion reigned supreme across Ben's countenance. &quot;It... doesn't?&quot;</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Nope!&quot; The Aasimar cheerfully chirped. &quot;Not one bit. Because I didn't really want to hire adventurers to fight adventurers. Look around you, boy.&quot;&quot;I'm hardly a b-&quot;&quot;Rigus is a productive community. We produce tons of goods, and although our farmlands aren't the best, its enough to sustain us. Most of all, we excel at the art of producing iron products - plows, spades, and even swords and shields. We have several community blacksmiths, and on top of this, we have many, many citizens in our fair little town...&quot;Ben had long stopped walking, now committed to just staring at the old man as he spoke.</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Rigus doesn't need adventurers to protect it. We're quite capable of repelling some silly old Paladin on our own. Heck, if we all arm ourselves and tell him to stay the hell out, he won't take another step forward. Paladins can be foolish blow-hards, but they won't willingly harm innocent people.&quot;&quot;I don't... understand. Why did you try to hire adventurers, then?&quot;&quot;Because we're all farmers,&quot; The old man explained. &quot;Scared farmers who have lived next to one of the most violent planes all our lives. They're terrified of violence. Terrified of what could be done to them. So terrified that it's never occurred to them what they could do back.&quot;A slow but inevitable understanding was dawning upon Ben's face. &quot;You need us to make them think they'll be safe.&quot;The Aasimar's hand slapped roughly against the middle of Ben's back. &quot;Now you're catching on, lad. It's an easy job. Just pretend to be the legendary Rin and all the villagers will be assured that they're unbeatable in battle. And in three weeks, that Paladin won't be facing just you and a couple of misbegotten... whatever you all are...&quot;&quot;Actors,&quot; Ben offered helpfully.&quot;Whatever the hell you are,&quot; The Aasimar repeated. &quot;He'll be facing an entire legion of farmers, too. Farmers who think they're being lead by an invincible swordsman. And Gods help us, that'll be more than enough.&quot;&quot;Were you going to give this speech to a real group of adventurers if they came?&quot; Ben asked, crooking his eyebrow up.</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Probably not. But for 100 jink? I wasn't expecting real adventurers. Just a bunch of wannabes.&quot; The Aasimar winked.</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">&quot;I've got a question.&quot;&quot;Shoot.&quot;&quot;What the hell is a farmer's community doing outside of one of the most dangerous planes in the Multiverse?&quot;&quot;That,&quot; The Aasimar said as he grinned, slapping something into Ben's hand, &quot;Is an excellent question.&quot;The Aasimar left, hobbling back towards his home in the distance. Ben glanced down at what the Aasimar had handed him.</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">It was a medallion, emblazoned with the symbol of a crumpled hat.</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">&quot;That's one strange old man,&quot; Ben muttered. Shoving the medallion in his pocket, he made his way back to the camp to explain what was up to his fellow actors.</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">-------------</font></p><p><font size="2"><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The next day, the furnaces of Rigus fired up to produce swords and weapons. It was the first time the village had produced weaponry of any sort for several decades - although they had long produced all </font><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif">sorts of armor to occasionally trade with the denizens of Acheron, weaponry itself had been strictly forbidden for as long as anyone could remember.</font></font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">A steady column of smoke raised from the village, curling and widening into the sky until it disappeared.</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">-------------</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">It is important at this point to note the power of belief and the ramifications it has upon the Multiverse. To demonstrate this point, we shall use the example of Arcadia.</font></p><font face="Arial"><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">If one were to travel away from Rigus, they would - depending on the direction - eventually come across a Portal Town called Automata, which sits atop of the border to the lawful plane known as Mechanus. Unless you happen to be interested in gears and other mechanical things, Automata and its neighboring plane are awfully boring places to be.</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">If you were to continue along your travels after arriving in Automata, you would eventually come to a pleasant farming village called Fortitude that borders the plane known as Arcadia. You might happen to note just how similar Fortitude is to Rigus, with the possible exception that it's no where near as rocky and uninhabitable. You might also note that it doesn't border the plane of tyranny and strife.</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">Arcadia itself consists of vividly lush farmlands that stretch out as far as the eye can see, separated by orderly orchards of carefully pruned fruit-trees of every type. It is a place where virtue brings profit and hard work is always rewarded. With its ripe fields of wheat floating atop of layers of chiseled rock, it is the ultimate summation of the phrase 'You get what you put in'.</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">However, the careful eye may notice that there is something out of place about the plane dedicated to peaceful rulers and gentle obedience. To be a little more specific, something's missing. To be precise, the entire third layer is missing.</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">There's a funny story behind that.</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">Although Arcadia is a place of law, the law does not exist for its own sake. Instead, the law serves a purpose - to allow those who follow it to serve the greater good. Sometimes this is easy to forget.</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">Menausus - the name of the now-missing third layer - served as home for the League of Agricultural Surveyors, a union of like-minded farmers who worked together to benefit all of Arcadia. They accepted rules amongst themselves to limit competition and meet their quotas as a whole instead of as individuals. Over the years, their membership grew to include the majority of Menausus. They enforced their regulations upon one another with an almost dangerous fervor, and non-members who inhabited Menausus were often socially ostracized by the majority of farmers who were members of the union.</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">Things steadily got worse. Some farmers liked to grow extra crops on the side, but the League of Agricultural Surveyors would strictly forbid any non-regulation planting and harvesting. Deciding that the League were being a bunch of brats, some members grew the extra crops anyway.</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">The League put the extra fields to the torch.</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">Things got out of hand. The League began destroying the farmlands of anyone who did not abide by every single one of their rules, whether they were a member or not. The list of their regulations, once simple and direct, became a long and tiresome puzzle of bureaucratic nonsense. Their meetings, previously short and succinct, now sometimes lasted an entire week.</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">The boiling point was reached when a new chapter house for the League opened up on Buxenos, Arcadia's second layer. The next day, the entire layer of Menausus had simply disappeared.</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">Perhaps by a strange coincidence, a new continent-sized gear covered in farmland and filled with bureaucratic busy-bodies appeared in the depths of Mechanus, where the law was always more important than the greater good.</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">Belief can quite literally shape the fabric of the Multiverse. If enough people believe that law is more important than good, then the land will change to reflect this belief. If enough people believe that you're a hero, then you might wake up and find that's just what you are.</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">-------------</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">It was in one of Rigus' unplanted fields where its sun-baked denizens practiced the art of war.</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">Benjamin and Jerald (who currently was in the form of an unsociable looking brute in leather) watched with quiet surprise as Jerum demonstrated the quickest method to incapacitate and kill an enemy.</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Hesitation and fear are what will cripple you,&quot; Jerum explained, the length of a dazzling bright iron blade held by its leather-wrapped haft. With a twist, he brought one of the two business ends chopping across the scare-crow to his left, snapping it across the front of the torso and leaving a ragged tear across its front. &quot;When you're facing an enemy, it's better to do something wrong then to do nothing at all.&quot;&quot;He's pretty sharp with the blade,&quot; Jerald muttered, lifting the glass of water from the table besides his chair.</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Yeah,&quot; Ben responded absently.</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Where did he say he was from, Ben?&quot;&quot;It's Rin,&quot; Ben corrected him without even thinking. &quot;An old acting troupe. Ran into some bad luck, from what he told me, so he had to find himself a new troupe. Him and Marien, that is.&quot;&quot;Mmmm...&quot; Jerald finished the glass of water, turning it upside down. &quot;Another glass, if you will.&quot;&quot;Right away, sir Jerald!&quot; Rumour chirped, snatching up the discarded container and running off back into the tavern to retrieve another.Ben stretched across the chair, seated on the patio of the tavern. &quot;So, Jerald. What do you think?&quot;&quot;I think he takes his role a little too seriously,&quot; Jerald responded with his usual effortless nonchalance. He shot a glance towards the lightly dressed boy, who was now demonstrating to several dozen villagers how to quickly gut a fallen opponent. &quot;Though I'll admit he's not a half-bad actor. Just a little rough around the edges.&quot;&quot;I was talking about our situation.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Oh, that.&quot; Jerald shrugged. &quot;We're in a bit deep. The job's cushy, certainly... Ah, thank you, boy,&quot; Jerald smiled at Rumour as the child ran out with a fresh glass of slightly-yellowish water. Jerald peered at it, sighed, and proceeded to throw it back with another gulp. &quot;But there are a few dangers. And a lot of variables.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Yeah... Uh, is it safe to talk about this in front of him?&quot; Ben asked, looking towards Rumour. The boy, suddenly finding himself drawing the attention of Rin, broke out into a wide cheerful smile.</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Ah, don't worry,&quot; Jerald said, smiling. He brought a large hand down upon Rumour's head, ruffling the boy's hair with his broad fingers. &quot;The boy's an ignoramus.&quot;&quot;What's an ignoramus?&quot; Rumour asked curiously. Jerald's smile only grew wider.&quot;Go ask your mother, my dear child,&quot; He replied.Rumour immediately ran off to do just that. Watching the boy go, Ben sighed and shook his head. &quot;You're a jerk.&quot;&quot;Quite. But more importantly, we should at least earn our keep. We're here to raise the morale of the village, yes? Not that I'm one to complain about an opportunity to do nothing, but maybe we should seize upon the chance a truly captive audience brings,&quot; Jerald explained smoothly, turning his gaze towards the sight of Jerum leading several men to battle against the treacherous race of motionless scare-crows.</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; Ben asked, eyebrows raising.Jerald smiled. &quot;Let's put on a play.&quot;&quot;Do you have something in mind?&quot;Jerald nodded. &quot;Something,&quot; He began whimsically, glancing up to the sky. &quot;With a happy ending.&quot;</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">-------------&quot;Is that a real tail?&quot;The question came from a child. A little girl, Jaer dimly realized. A little girl who was following the tiefling through the street, her dark serious eyes locked upon the appendage that had slipped of its own accord out from the back of her shirt.</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Yeah,&quot; Jaer muttered, &quot;It is. What of it?&quot;&quot;Why do you have a tail?&quot; Fact asked.</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">&quot;None of your beeswax, kid,&quot; Jaer responded automatically. She turned back to look at her destination - the tavern, only ten or so yards off. Beyond it, she could hear the sounds of men practicing the art of warfare. Instantly, she thought of Jerum, and stifled a grimace.</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">&quot;But I've never seen anyone who has a tail,&quot; Fact began, frowning. &quot;I just want to know why you have one.&quot;Jaer peered over her shoulder. The girl was still doggedly following her. &quot;I was born with it, all right? So pike off.&quot;&quot;Born with it? So your father had a tail?&quot; Fact continued.&quot;Hell's bells!&quot; Jaer spun around, locking a glare on Fact that could wither daisies at thirty paces. The girl simply stared back with a fearless sort of curiosity. &quot;Why do you ask so many clueless questions?!&quot;&quot;Because I like to learn about things,&quot; The girl responded. &quot;What's a kip?&quot;</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Don't you have something better to do? Like, prepare for war, or something?&quot; Jaer asked, continuing to glower.&quot;They're not letting the girls do anything. They don't want us fighting or using any of the swords or anything, and we can't help in the forges.&quot; Fact admitted, glancing down. &quot;Some of the boys my age are going to be armed, but they say I can't.&quot;Jaer snarled, twirling about with her tail lashing about agitatedly. &quot;Bloody figures! Men are idiots. They're always marching around, declaring war on something or other, and when they get themselves so deep in that they can't get out they tell you that you can't help them just because you got a pair of breasts! It's so bloody hypocritical!&quot; She began a steady march towards the bar, but her eyes were staring past it towards the field where Jerum was practicing.</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">Emboldened by Jaer's sudden shift from being angry at her to being angry at men, Fact began to march right besides her. &quot;And they're always goofing off, too! And telling me what to do!&quot;&quot;Always running off to fight some stupid battle in the name of vengeance or whatever and getting themselves killed,&quot; Jaer continued, glowering forward.</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">Fact desperately searched for something else to add. &quot;And... and they smell real bad, too!&quot;</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">Jaer suddenly stopped walking, peering down at Fact. Feeling suddenly silly and self-conscious, the girl shuffled uncomfortably underneath the gaze.&quot;I have a tail because of my mother,&quot; Jaer explained half-heartedly. &quot;She was an erinyes... A type of demon.&quot;&quot;Your mother was a demon?&quot; Fact asked, blinking up towards the tiefling with a look bordering on fascination.</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">Sighing in reluctant surrender, Jaer smiled. &quot;Yeah. I'll tell you about it on one condition.&quot;&quot;What's that?&quot;&quot;You pour me whatever the hell passes as bub in that kip over there,&quot; Jaer said, pointing at the tavern.</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Sure!&quot; Fact chirped, beginning to move towards the entrance. Half-way there, she stopped and turned around. &quot;Uh, what's bub?&quot;</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">-------------</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">Everyone was having a fairly good time except one person. In case you haven't guessed it, that one person was a githzerai named Marien.</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">Marien wasn't having a good time because Marien could see the future. Oh, no one believed her, of course. That was part of the deal. The one person in the world who knew what was coming next was the one person in the world who's advice you'd never take. Like we said: Fate is an exceptionally mean-spirited bitch.</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">Over time, it got to be very depressing. Which was one of the primary reasons why Marien was never happy.</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">However, this specific occasion gave her reason to be very unhappy. Because she had just received a Vision. A Vision of Things To Come.</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">As always, it didn't look very good. And just like usual, no one was going to believe her when she told them about it.</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">She had seen the Fallen One with his comrades come to the village, and witnessed all his bluster come to no avail. She had seen him fall at the hands of the village's protectors, and victory come to Rigus. And then she had seen the Bargain undone, and the Beast unchained, and His fury moved to swallow up everyone and everything before Him.</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">But the most puzzling part of her vision was the champion who rose up to face the Beast in the village's final hours. It had been an old man wearing a crumpled hat, wielding what looked to be an old-fashioned wooden billet.</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Marien!&quot; Ben's voice came from the distance. The older man was running back towards the dwindling fires of the actor's camp. The githzerai stirred from her bedroll, sitting up and rubbing her large eyes. &quot;Marien! Jerald just had an absolutely wonderful idea!&quot;</font></p><p><font face="arial,helvetica,sans-serif" size="2">&quot;Something terrible is coming our way,&quot; Marien gloomily muttered as Ben approached.&quot;Oh quit being so glum,&quot; Ben cut her off with a grin. &quot;Listen: We're going to do a play! One of the ones with a happy ending!&quot;&quot;At least something will end well,&quot; Marien mused.</font></p></font></p>   </div>
