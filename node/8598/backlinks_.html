Adventuring on Ortho</span></span></p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>(AKA The DMs Guide To Adventuring on Ortho)</div></p>

<p>To the lamentation of many an adventurous thrill-seeker, the world of Ortho is a sadly staid and stable place to live. Mighty metropolises host millions behind secure walls, while farmers plough and reap in safety thanks to Hardhead patrols and thoroughly-tamed ‘wilds’ that harbour nothing more than endless crop-fields and workhouses. Most people have never even <span style="font-style:italic">heard </span>of the kind of trouble adventurers usually deal with, let alone experienced it for themselves.</p>

<p>Of course this is not true everywhere: Life is very different in idealised Harmony’s Glory to the devil, mind flayer, and hobgoblin-infested horror that is Thaera. For the most part however, life is secure even if it’s not pleasant. Monsters don’t roam the wilderness, mad wizards don’t lurk in every tower, and if orcs kick your door down in the middle of the night the chances are they have a search warrant. Ortho (and her more domesticated colonies) are about as far away from the standard ‘points of light’ setting for D&amp;D as its possible to get. In fact, the populace generally shakes its head sadly when it hears of such places, pities them, and encourages the Harmonium to move in and pacify it. For the average (well behaved) citizen life is uniform. Life is safe. Life is <span style="font-style:italic">boring</span>.</p>

<p>All this would make for a <span style="font-style:italic">terrible </span>average game of Dungeons and Dragons – but fortunately Ortho has adventure opportunities aplenty, even if many of them are rather different from the dragon-slaying and goblin-chasing of most campaigns. </p>

<p>First and foremost, Ortho is a setting shaped by its unique politics: The law here is literally an extension of the driving philosophy of the Harmonium and tightly bound to their determination for order, unity, and peace; many adventures will feature additional ‘flavour’ (sometimes small, sometimes large) as a result of this. For groups playing Harmonium members this means that the traditional ‘dark cloaked stranger in a tavern’ start to an adventure will be replaced by a formal briefing from an official in the chain of command. Alternatively if your player characters are steadfast rebels and opponents, then the ‘evil empire’ has stormtroopers aplenty to chase them around with, and who can also wax lyrical about what’s so the good about their system and so bad about the rebels’ beliefs.</p>

<p>PCs will also have to contend with ‘the long arm of the law’ throughout their careers. Let’s face it; typical adventurers fall into one of three categories: mercenary, thief, or vigilante. Ortho has time for none of these ne’er-do-wells. Standard adventuring groups are going to have to keep a low profile or be actively in-bed with the authorities or the underworld in order to survive. One way or another, the Pax Harmonium will impinge on their daily lives, from weapon permits and peacebonds to Beholder tyrannies to devil-ridden corruption. </p>

<p>It’s certainly not impossible to adventure in the standard mould however. Ortho is a whole world and the Harmonium can’t be everywhere at once – and sometimes you’d rather the local variation on Harmony <span style="font-style:italic">wasn’t </span>ready to step in. </p>

<p>There are a few wild lands remaining in inaccessible corners of Ortho and the notably less secure worlds of the Eight Jewels of Harmony and Outside Territories for adventurers to roam through. Dangers also lurk in the heart of civilisation as well: corrupt officials, underground cults, lurking mind flayers, demons, and shapeshifters, and even the occasional marauding humanoid have their talons into Ortho – they just have to do under the watchful eye of the Harmonium. This usually means secretly.</p>

<p>Below are several archetypical adventuring plots and their most obvious local counterpart on Ortho:</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dark Cult: </span>As well as the obvious target of Alzrius and worshippers of the Lords of Chaos, Ortho has secretive devotees to both the Lords of the Nine and the Hebdomad (the seven archangels of Mount Celestia), as well as mind flayers, the Forbidden Goddess, and extreme versions of Didairdin’s faith such as the hobgoblin cult of Hextor. Followers of the Hebdomad in particular make excellent enemies for a Good-aligned Harmonium group, since they’ll have so much morality in common. Ortho also has its fair share of secular cults, from the Spawn of Ruay and the Cult of Empty Heaven to unscrupulous citizens who hide perverted lusts behind seemingly respectable fronts. Ortho’s insistence on visible conformity means that a lot of unsavoury things are hidden just below the surface.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Corrupt Official: </span>Ambition and greed are as present on Ortho as they are on other worlds, and can often hide behind the respectable façade of OCA or Harmonium membership, using innocent henchmen who think they’re obeying a legitimate authority. Some of these villains are politically motivated (like the Shoryko Historical Society), others might simply look at ‘harmony’ in a less benevolent way than the PCs – Beholders, Devils, Hobgoblins, and Orcs are all prime candidates for this and they’re not even necessarily evil in the classic sense. Loyal Harmonium characters can fight fanatics and hardliners, Juhlienists or federalists, ensuring that the right kind of Harmony is the one being forced onto the world. Whether you are working for or fighting against them, the Harmonium make a perfect catalyst for conflict. Virtually every party will fight for or against the Harmonium at some point. Most will do both. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Exploration: </span>Even on a world as peaceful as Ortho there are still plenty of hidden or sequestered wilderness areas: The steaming jungles of Hazhkan or the frozen wastes of Gelidahl, where no Hardhead has yet explored; the lonely expanses of Karazam and Bafatai; lawless Thaeran isles, and unexplored Hekan caverns… These all provide perfect opportunities for the PCs to kill monsters without worrying about getting sued by bereaved relatives. Just remember that the OCA has eyes everywhere and no one can hide from the Harmonium forever – although many think try.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Machiavellian Machination: </span>Nobles still scheme, viziers still plot, and corrupt officials still embezzle from the people. The Hierarchs of Motmurk constantly push for greater power, the rulers of Meter want more independence and respect than a mere ‘colony’ can have, and the devils of South Thaera are in almost open war amongst themselves. Voll’s nobility has plenty of secrets, Xaric and Osmopondia have competing city-states, Eallia has political as well as military revolt, Han has its rival merchant houses and their ‘Quiet War’, and Keln has beholders. It’s easy to run a whole campaign on Ortho based around political intrigue… Perhaps a roving diplomat and his staff? Even seemingly mundane problems like  high tax on coconuts or a land use disputes in a river valley can be the impetus for espionage blackmail, or even assassination. You don't have to overdo it, but the PCs should run into enough corrupt land owners, amoral politicians, and over-zealous revolutionaries to keep things interesting.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Rebellion: </span>Ortho has a number of elusive enemies, many of whom have backing from extraplanar powers. The Lords of Chaos are obviously public enemy number one (see Forbidden Cults above), but there are also the Burrowdogs, the Mhaol, the Cult of Empty Heaven, and planar Factions to be countered. Colonies and Outside Territories might also be site of unrest, just waiting for PCs to inspire or suppress them: Meter’s political unrest could potentially turn nasty, and Eallia is officially in revolt already, for example. Terrorists and revolutionaries even have a Lord of Chaos (Chal, Lord of Ruin) as a patron!</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Invasion: </span>Ortho is an empire spanning worlds – and planes - with millions of men at its disposal. It’s not invincible however, and it’s not alone in being a ‘superpower’ of the material plane. The other powers of wildspace and the Planes are a constant threat to the expansion of universal peace, and many aren’t prepared to wait until its ‘their turn’ to be subsumed or destroyed. The great Elven Armada certainly doesn’t harbour any warm feelings for the OCA, and neither to the Illithid or Neogi (both major spelljamming races). Planar Factions like the Anarchists, Athar, Xaosetics, or even Indeps might set their sights on Ortho with an eye to doing enough damage to make the Harmonium fault its march of conquest. And beyond even these threats there are elder evils and epic monsters like the Draeden to defend against. Wars may be a thing of the past internally, but there’s always the chance that someone will come along from outside and start one.</p>

<span style="font-style:italic">Location: Any <br />
Suitability: Harmonium would be particularly suitable </span></p>

<p>One of the PCs becomes friends with a middle-aged scholar of the School of Ethics called Anjus Scaif. In his youth Anjus was very briefly involved with the Cult of Empty Heaven, something that’s still recorded in his Sealed Notes. After a stern warning from the Harmonium, Anjus put aside such rebellious thoughts and has had a productive and law-abiding career. Sufficiently upstanding in fact, that he’s now running for public office. He’s made no secret of his past or that it was a mistake, but it’s still made his campaign an uphill struggle. </p>

<p>By some unhappy accident the PC discovers a cache of forbidden books in Anjus’ house (hidden in the attic, behind a loose brick in the cellar, etc). Clearly they’ve not been used in some time… but they’re still forbidden materials - especially in the hands of someone with a record of prior involvement with the Cult. Given Anjus’ history reporting this find will certainly result in a lengthy investigation and his exclusion from the political race – his reputation would be ruined. <br />
 <br />
The PC has several options: </p>

<p>Inform the authorities – in which case the investigation is handed to exactly the sort of inquisitorial fanatic that will make certain Anjus is found guilty (such as Zinzr’Gor, the beholder cleric of Saeduenical from ‘Wanted Wands’ below). </p>

<p>Re-hide the books – becoming an accomplice in the eyes of the law. This is a particularly sinful act for lawful characters. </p>

<p>Take the books – unless the PC has a failsafe way to transport them across the city, he will have to nervously carry an armload of dusty forbidden texts through the streets without attracting notice or appearing suspicious (be sure to make any Bluff rolls for the character “behind the screen” so he’s not sure how convincing he’s actually been…) </p>

<p>Once the character gets the books to a safe place, he or she has several options: </p>

<p>Keep the books for study – this has its own problems. Let’s hope the PC lives alone, for example. </p>

<p>Destroy them – Not difficult providing the PC can do it privately (remember that fires private are restricted in most allots, and great plumes of white paper-smoke might also attract attention if the DM is feeling cruel). If observed, the PC might well open themselves to investigation. </p>

<p>Sell them – To the right buyer, such books are worth a pretty penny. Finding one however, might be an adventure in itself! Even if successful, the character might soon regret making contact with the underworld… </p>

<p>If approached by the PC, Anjus denies any connection to the tomes, claiming that they must have been stashed there by one of the villa’s previous owners (it’s a rented manse, and Anjus has only been in residence for a few years). The truth of the matter and where it might lead is up to the DM to decide; what’s most important here is the moral decision that the PC makes – and making them feel really nervous if they choose a deceitful option. </p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Options &amp; Complications </span></p>

<p>The books have been planted at Anjus’ house by an unscrupulous political rival – he plans to have Anjus Scaif removed from the race under falsified charges. </p>

<p>The books have been planted, but by agents of the church of Saeduenical; they were designed to be found and the ‘accident’ of their discovery was anything but. They were put there specifically to test Anjus’ loyalty – but the PC has accidentally discovered them before Anjus has had a chance to. </p>

<p>As above – but they were actually put there to test the PC’s loyalty. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">“A Sudden Change of Policy” </span><br />
<span style="font-style:italic">Location: A major city with a strongly Lawful Good government <br />
Suitability: Harmonium will have a distinct advantage </span></p>

<p>Something is afoot in a major city. The local Harmonium has begun a severe crackdown on the underworld, the free folk, the Licensed Quarters - in fact on anybody who steps out of line. Previously tolerant officers have become merciless enforcers of the law with no quarter asked or given and no room for compromise, no excuses, and no time for mitigating circumstances. Everything is being done strictly according to the law and crime is down… but there are mutterings among the persecuted that the general truce between law and lawless to keep things civil has almost reached breaking point. The newly elected chief of civil patrol Malik Sheyr is proud of his accomplishments however, saying that for too long the officers under his command have been lax, lazy, and compromising. “This is the new way of things,” he says. “If the lawless don’t like it, all they have to do is stay lawful.” </p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Getting the PCs involved </span></p>

<p>1. Exigency PCs are dispatched undercover to the area - either assigned to the civil patrol or as normal citizens - to discover what’s exactly going on. Their Liaison is concerned that there’s more to this new crackdown than meets the eye; Sheyr used to be an Exigency Liaison himself and was notorious for ruthless and underhand tactics, justified as “for the good of the Pax Harmonium.” </p>

<p>2. PCs with Freefolk or underworld connections are hired to get some dirt on Captain Sheyr, so he can be ‘persuaded’ to ease off on his crusade. Their connections make it abundantly clear that they are NOT to just kill him or instigate something that will simply make matters worse. </p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">What’s Going On? </span></p>

<p>Although he appears human, Malik Sheyr is actually a Rakshasa. He’s also a committed member of the Harmonium – in fact, a former Crisis Team agent and Exigency Liaison. As part of this secret role, Malik is allowed to conceal his true nature, although it’s still recorded in his Private Notes if the PCs can somehow get access to them (unlikely since he’s higher ranked than them and they don’t have evidence to warrant a requisition order). </p>

<p>Malik’s ‘crackdown’ is motivated by a genuine desire to eradicate the enemies of the Harmonium and ensure a peaceful and law-abiding society… it’s just being done with the aid of forbidden magic. Malik has carefully selected his ‘victims’ (after examining their records), and one by one exposed the best Lawful Good civil patrol officers in the city to a device called the Mirror of Baleful Simulacra. The mirror captures the image of those looking into it, which can be summoned forth by the mirror’s owner – creating a simulacrum with identical memories and a similar personality, but a reversal of the viewer’s moral (good/evil) alignment. In each case Malik (who has no desire to harm lawful Harmonium officers) has dispatched each good-aligned officer for ‘special training’ outside the city, while their evil duplicate takes up their old life. Once the underworld and free folk have learned their place Malik will dismiss the duplicates (possibly by sending them on a suicide mission “for the good of the Pax Harmonium”), magically alter the memories of the originals as they return, and enjoy the benefits of a more lawful and peaceful city with a well-cowed populace. He then plans to move on to another city, and then another, until all of Ortho has been cleansed of its chaotic elements. </p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Options &amp; Complications </span></p>

<p>The local Exigency Liaison (not the one who sends in the PCs) was formerly Malik’s aide. He’s part of the conspiracy and thoroughly on the Rakshasa’s side (although he doesn’t know about the magic mirror). If the Rakshasa suspects he’s being investigated, he will have a Crisis Team activated to spy on, sabotage, and (only if absolutely necessary) eliminate the PCs. Harmonium parties might well find themselves opposed by enemies equally as dedicated and well-trained as themselves. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">“Checkpoint” </span><br />
<span style="font-style:italic">Location: Any (especially Iironda) <br />
Suitability: Characters with low Will saves will have a particularly ‘interesting’ time… </span></p>

<p>A trio of Snake Dancers have hit upon a new and amusing scam: Using a mix of Charm, Suggestion, illusions, and physical props they set up a fake Harmonium checkpoint on a stretch of secluded road, and charge a toll from anyone who passes. Travellers who complain are informed that the new tax is a temporary addition - usually they claim that it’s to finance some new structure or initiative that the traveller looks like they’d appreciate, but occasionally a Dancer’s sense of humour gets the better of them and they make up something silly instead (‘on behalf of orphaned beholders’ or similar). </p>

<p>The Snake Dancers set up on a given road for a few days, but dismantle and disappear before anyone gets too suspicious or real troops show up. </p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Getting the PCs involved </span></p>

<p>1. The Harmonium has heard about the scam, but wants to keep the matter very quiet for fear of inspiring imitators. Rather than sending out legions to search for the fake checkpoint, they send in an Exigency Squad (the PCs) into the area undercover as traders to deal with it discretely. <br />
 <br />
2. A Venture Company (perhaps the PCs’ own?) has been made victim of the Dancers, but have now figured out that its a scam and hire the PCs to get even with the thieves without alerting the authorities (they also don’t want to share the Dancers’ ill-gotten gains with the Hardheads). </p>

<p>3. The party might be victims of the scam and decide to take matters into their own hands. Few things in this world are more vengeful than PCs who think they’ve been had! </p>

<p>4. One of the Snake Dancers hires the PCs, disguised as one of the options above. He wants rid of his partners and will assist the PCs as long as he can keep them under control. </p>

<p>It’s possible that one or more real Harmonium officers are also involved in the con, motivated by corruption or judicious use of Charm Person. This will of course make the PCs’ task much more difficult – characters with a low Will save and flexible morals might even find themselves becoming part of the conspiracy! </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">"Clerical Error"</span><br />
<span style="font-style:italic">Location: Any <br />
Suitability: Any </span></p>

<p>The PCs are approached by a terrified-looking cleric of the order of Iathiphos, who begs them to grant him a private audience. He has terrible information to impart: “Information vital to the integrity of the Pax Harmonium and the safety of thousands of its citizens!” </p>

<p>This troubled young half-orc is Nevrikos of the Bluefang, an acolyte of the Lord of Bookkeepers. Originally of northern Xaric, Nevrikos has recently earned a transfer to a prestigious archive (near wherever the PCs happen to be). While studying there however, he made a terrible discovery when working on an ancient document. </p>

<p>The document is question is none other than the original treaty between Motmurk and ‘The Alliance of Harmony’ (Voll and newly-freed Iathra). Nevrikos claims that the treaty was mistranslated centuries ago, and that the initial famous alliance between the Knights of Harmony and the Hierarchs of Motmurk (as masterminded by King Romhel and Varzak of the Crushing Fist), upon which all future treatise and alliances are based, doesn’t say what everyone thinks it says, and is not in fact a pledge to the philosophy of the Knights of Harmony at all. </p>

<p>The crux of this argument is that a specific orcish word, Ukbur (“forever” – as in “we will follow the code of the Knights of Harmony forever to rid the world of its enemies”) was mistranslated by the scribes who took down Varzak’s agreement with Romhel. Nevrikos has seen the original document and claims that the term actually used was urkubr, which means “as long as is necessary”). The truth (Nevrikos earnestly claims) is that Varzak’s pledge of allegiance to the Knights of Harmony was not meant to last forever – just until their enemies (Thaera and Ortho’s other chaotic forces) were defeated. All the treatises which followed were based upon that one agreement by the Great Hierarch, and if it’s wrong then all the agreements that followed are null and void – Motmurk isn’t technically part of the empire at all!</p>

<p>PCs might well laugh at the young cleric for his panic - after all, Motmurk has been a loyal member of the Pax Harmonium for five hundred years and Varzak was one of the founders of the Octave. Expressing any such doubts will leave Nevrikos outraged and on the verge of nervous collapse; the church of Iathiphos prides itself on accurate record keeping and the discovery that one of its members mistranslated a vital text for of all people King Romhel himself would be a major blow to both the church’s reputation and the sanctity of its holy doctrine – especially since the scribe in question (Patriarch Malagant of Voll) is a revered saint of the faith. </p>

<p>Politically canny PCs will also realise how the situation could be exploited by Motmurk’s enemies (and troublemakers within orcish lands) and by various rebel groups. The situation isn’t quite so funny as it first appears… </p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Options &amp; Complications </span></p>

<p>• One of the Player Characters is descended from Patriarch Malagant and the honour of his entire lineage is now at stake. </p>

<p>• A Harmonium officer hires the PCs to break into the archive and subtly alter the original document to its perceived meaning. </p>

<p>• The PCs are charged with silencing Nevrikos… permanently. </p>

<p>• Nevrikos and the PCs are swiftly dispatched to Motmurk to get a new (secret) treaty signed by Rokmorn the Bloodletter. </p>

<p>• The PCs are stalked by murderous clerics of Iathiphos determined to preserve the church’s reputation. They aren’t skilled combatants but have a large number of magical scrolls and other paper-based magic. </p>

<p>• Clerics of Ina oppose the PCs – either trying to preserve the secret or to reveal it. Perhaps different clerics with opposing agendas involve themselves in the party’s quest? </p>

<p>• Knowingly or not, Nevrikos is part of a plan to discredit the church of Iathiphos, designed by cunning infiltrators from the Cult of Empty Heaven (perhaps worshippers of the Nine) or an Anarchist cell. Members of the conspiracy are already shadowing Nevrikos and the PCs, to either thwart or assist them as circumstances demand. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">“Dead Ringer” </span><br />
<span style="font-style:italic">Location: Any <br />
Suitability: Any </span></p>

<p>The characters are enjoying some ‘down time’ between adventures when one by one they are approached by a sombre-looking Harmonium officer from the Civil Patrol. One of their number has apparently been found dead. </p>

<p>The officer (Notary Haukswight) will question the characters about their deceased companion. Depending on the PCs’ reputation and criminal record, this could be anything from a quick word to a formal interview under threat of prison. Assuming there are no complications and everyone’s story checks out however, they won’t be in any further trouble. </p>

<p>Given the travelling nature of most PCs, the party will probably be the nearest ‘next of kin’ and will be called to identify the body and take it from the local morgue. Examination of the corpse will confirm in every way that it is the deceased PC (except perhaps for a couple of minor details, see below) but shortly after this the party will see the supposedly dead PC walk back into his lodgings with no idea what’s going on. </p>

<p>The ‘deceased’ is perfectly hale and hearty with no idea as to what the commotion is about! As far as he or she is concerned, nothing untoward has happened to them recently. </p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">What going on? </span></p>

<p>• The deceased is an entirely coincidental non-magical double of the PC. It’s simply a matter of mistaken identity. The PC in question might have an uncomfortable time looking at his ‘twin’ but is otherwise uninvolved. Investigating their double’s life might reveal that they are somehow distantly related… or the cause of their physical similarity might remain a complete mystery. </p>

<p>• As above, but the double was murdered by one of the PC’s enemies, who mistook the double for the real thing. This might be the first clue that their enemy has returned. </p>

<p>• As option one, but if they investigate the double, they learn that the deceased actually had a far better life than the PC did. If the character dares to try and impersonate their double, they can benefit considerably (financially, socially, access to something they’ve always wanted etc). The double’s life might bring complications of its own however, from gambling debts to political enemies to membership of an illegal group or cult. </p>

<p>• The ‘living’ character is actually a Simulacrum created by a disreputable freefolk wizard named Persios Dax. Persios was accidentally responsible for the PC’s death, having embroiled them (willingly) in some nefarious scheme. He created the simulacrum to replace the dead PC until he could find a way to have the real character raised somehow. Unfortunately the Civil Patrol found the body first. The simulacrum has been ordered to pretend to be the real character at all times, but also to be truthful and obedient to Persios and the original if they somehow should meet it. If the real PC is returned to life and the construct survives, the simulacrum might become a very unusual cohort for the character. </p>

<p>• The living character is a doppelganger, and has been for some time. Once trouble erupts however, he or she flees. The original was being held captive by the doppelganger in its lair. It managed to escape but in doing so was struck by the doppelganger’s poisonous guardian beast, succumbing to its venom shortly after her escape. If the deceased is questioned via a Speak with Dead spell, it confirms the truth and can guide its comrades to the monster’s lair. </p>

<p>• The living character is a Clone, and the corpse is the original body. Unknown to the rest of the group, the original was on a secret mission for the Harmonium, and perished in the line of duty. The previously Cloned body was immediately entered by the PC’s sprit (see the spell description), but additional magic stripped the character of their recent memories. If the PCs investigate the death of their ‘double’ they will eventually stumble upon the threat that killed him. They will have a powerful ally however, in the form of the Harmonium wizard who originally sent the PC on the ‘suicide mission.’ </p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">DMing Notes </span></p>

<p>Some of these adventure options force pretty arbitrary events on the unlucky PC, and not all players will be comfortable with this. If this is an issue for your group then the Dungeon Master should make clear the ‘unusual’ nature of the adventure to the appropriate Player and ensure that their character does not suffer unduly in being Raised or Resurrected (perhaps ignoring the XP or CON loss, or providing them with some other compensation). Alternatively, this can be a good scenario to run if one player can’t make a session or two. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">“Dive! Dive! Dive!” </span><br />
<span style="font-style:italic">Location: Off the coast of Pan Thaera <br />
Suitability: Free Folk would be particularly appropriate </span></p>

<p>An unusually large number of seariever attacks have been plaguing the Isles of Thaera. Several ships have been attacked, leaving no survivors. Divinations have revealed only that all is not what it seems. </p>

<p>The truth is that it’s not searievers at all who are responsible. It’s actually a band of mer pirates lead by an unscrupulous druid. They are actually riding a Dragon Turtle, which they use to make their attacks look like the work of a monster. In fact they swarm aboard after the dragon turtle’s initial attack and raid the ship, using shark-toothed clubs and serrated scimitars to avoid the tell-tale presence of weapon marks on the bodies. After stealing a portion of the cargo and strapping it to their steed’s shell, they have the creature destroy the ship and feed on the sailors (sometimes alive).</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Getting the PCs Involved</span></p>

<p>1. Harmonium PCs are assigned to an Exigency Squad and ordered to investigate and resolve the situation. </p>

<p>2. A Venture Company party might be travelling the area and rather nervous about their chances of being attacked. Many ships would welcome passengers who are handy in a fight, and offer the group cheap rates for their journey. </p>

<p>3. Parties consisting of criminals or general Free Folk could be hired by the Seven Turtles Cartel or the Rosesail Freedom Venture Company to find the cause of the attacks. </p>

<p>4. If she discovers what’s going on, Sin Laah of Seven Turtle Bay will be worried that the pirates’ modus operandi will draw attention to her own peoples’ nefarious deals. She wants the pirates stopped but would really like their trained dragon turtle if the party can somehow capture it.  </p>

<p>The PCs might travel the area several times before being attacked, a good chance to get acquainted with nautical life. If they manage to drive off the pirates, the mer will flee by retreating to the dragon turtle and having it dive underwater and swim off. They will then secretly follow the PC’s ship and try to sink it if they can.</p>

<p>The PCs will need specialist magic to chase pirates beneath the sea… If the group have completed “Mercy of the Deep” then perhaps they could call on their friend Essil and the Siren’s Kiss, or maybe they could borrow the mechanical dragon turtle that’s “almost finished” being constructed in Seven Turtle Bay? </p>

<p> <br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">“Doppelgangsters” </span><br />
<span style="font-style:italic">Location: Any (the lavish palaces of Han would be a particularly good setting) <br />
Suitability: Bards, rogues, and high-CHS characters are particularly appropriate </span></p>

<p>The PCs are equipped with magic to assist them in infiltrating a meeting of criminal gangs from across the continent. Non-Harmonium PCs might be hired by the Cartels to spy on the meeting, while Hardheads could be sent in to gather information and intelligence. One very special thing makes this case different from others and necessitates the use of an Exigency Team/band of skilled freeblades: The criminals in question are all doppelgangers. </p>

<p>Their patron/commanding officer does have some information on the event, from a similar meeting that took place about thirty years ago. These meetings (which apparently take place every decade) allow the doppelganger clans to keep in touch, assess potential threats and opportunities, and to assign status, prestige, and scorn amongst themselves. The current conclave is taking place at a prestigious ballroom, including a full banquet and formal dance. All the clans will be expected to maintain a low profile and behave themselves, although every conclave is notorious for trickery and pranks.</p>

<p>If armed with appropriate magical defences, this might actually work in the PC’s favour. Everyone will be in disguise and pretending to be someone else (another doppelganger tradition) and most of the creatures will not have seen each other for quite a while. With glibness and some appropriate magic the PCs should be able to pass for one of the crafty monsters… </p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Training the PCs</span></p>

<p>The PCs receive a crash course in bluff, doppelganger lore, dancing, etiquette, and whatever other skills their employer perceives them as needing for a formal ball. Exactly what magical aid is provided is up to the DM, but Potions of Detect Thoughts and some means of altering their appearance (Alter Self, Disguise Self, Polymorph, Hats of Disguise, etc) are essential. Appropriate stat-boosting spells or potions (Cat’s Grace, Eagle’s Splendour, Owl’s Wisdom) might also be useful, as would be the means to disguise their own minds (like Mind Blank or Protection from Spells). If the PCs are hired by a private individual then their patron will be particularly keen to get their money’s worth from all this investment! </p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">So why are the doppelgangers getting together? </span></p>

<p>• Family Reunion - several clans of doppelgangers are meeting for their regular conclave. There’s no particular conspiracy (other than them being criminal monsters) but the doppelgangers will be drinking, feasting, bragging, and gossiping. The PCs can learn of many scams and secrets at the meeting and can make arrangements to lure several clans into traps later on. </p>

<p>• The Great Debate - the clans are gathering for a major debate: A small alliance of clan masters has proposed that the doppelgangers swear allegiance to the Harmonium, pledging their loyalty and services in exchange for amnesty. </p>

<p>• Exodus – the doppelganger clans are meeting for their regular conclave, but a major debate is going to spring up: One of the clan masters has found a secret route off of Ortho, for all doppelgangers who desire it. The clans are debating whether or nor to abandon the world en masse. While this might sound like a good thing, whatever method they’re planning on using is clearly a major breach of security. </p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Further Developments &amp; Complications </span></p>

<p>1. The doppelgangers keep changing their disguises! The face they spoke to five minutes ago might now belong be a completely different creature. </p>

<p>2. Anyone seen to do or say something particularly clever is immediately imitated by several doppelgangers. </p>

<p>3. A number of doppelgangers come to the party in the form of very famous and high-ranked individuals (Composers, Senior Patriarchs, etc). Just imitators, or are those people really doppelgangers? </p>

<p>4. A rival group of adventurers (free folk or Harmonium, whatever the opposite of the PCs is) have also infiltrated the meeting with the same aim as the Player Characters. </p>

<p>5. The food is absolutely disgusting, enough to make the strongest stomach gag – like raw, continually shifting, mimic. The doppelgangers of course, are fine with it. </p>

<p>6. One of the Doppelgangers becomes romantically attracted to a charismatic PC </p>

<p> <br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">“Fire in the Belly” </span><br />
<span style="font-style:italic">Location: Any Mountains <br />
Suitability: Harmonium </span></p>

<p>Centipede is a small dwarven enclave built into the side of Mount Rumblebelly, a supposedly long-extinct volcano. Recently however, the earth has begun to quiver and lava has bubbled up. Like all ancient dwarf communities, Centipede has flow-channels built specifically for channelling magma away from the hive, but these have been little used; the volcano hasn’t been active for five hundred years. </p>

<p>Magma is seeping steadily up through the lowest corridors and caverns of Centipede, bypassing the old defences by bad luck or design (the dwarfs aren’t sure). The inhabitants have managed to avoid disaster so far, but if things go on it’s just a matter of time until major destruction or loss of life occurs. The dwarfs have tried to solve the problem themselves, but have run into trouble – the spirits of dwarven ancestors have appeared in the tunnels, silent but clearly condemning of the workers. The local Exigency Liaison believes that outsiders (especially non-dwarfs) need to approach the problem before things get even worse. </p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">The History of Rumblebelly </span></p>

<p>Back before the Knights of Harmony, Mount Rumblebelly was known as Tahukabajash - ‘Hungry Belly of the Fire God’ (Kabajij in fact) in an old local dialect. Its modern name was put in place after the Knights of Harmony cleared the area of its volcano-cult, which practised human sacrifice and powerful destructive fire magic all too similar to those wielded by servants of Demon-lord Alzrius. A few paranoid dwarven families remember this and believe that Kabajij has returned to punish the dwarves for their faithlessness. </p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">What’s going on? </span></p>

<p>1. Hordes of the dwarfhold’s namesakes (giant poisonous centipedes) come crawling up from the depths looking for shelter. </p>

<p>2. The ghosts of dwarven ancestors really are rising up – neglected by the cult of ancestors because of their savage and chaotic ways, these apparitions (all worshippers of Kabajij) are directing the lava. Treat these fiery dwarven ancestors as Azer with the Ghost template. They may also have some exemplar support from Kabajij’s realm. </p>

<p>3. The elemental vortex has reopened in the heart of the extinct volcano, sending fiery elemental matter gushing out. Several elemental creatures have been drawn through the breach or come through exploring, but they mean no particular harm – and some may only be concerned about getting back. Azer, Efreeti, Elementals, Fire Ganasi, etc are all possible visitors. This might be a natural occurrence or one triggered (possibly accidentally) by an ancient artefact of the volcano cult. </p>

<p>4. As above, but this is a concerted attack designed to flood the dwarfhold and raid its mines for loot. The culprits are mercenaries drawn from the elemental Planes of Earth and Fire. Skilled PCs might be able to disrupt this tenuous alliance of planar thieves. </p>

<p>5. The trouble is being caused by a band of native thieves, who plan to loot the treasuries of the hold under cover of the “natural disaster” – a powerful Black Alchemist is summoning and directing the lava… and he’s no longer be under the gang’s full control. </p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Options and Complications </span></p>

<p>1. Rumours of ‘the Curse of Kabajij’ have surfaced (possibly deliberately spread) and people are clamouring to get out of the city – they want to abandon Centipede entirely until the matter is resolved, but the local Harmonium see this as an unacceptable surrender to chaos and panic. </p>

<p>2. The tunnels below Centipede are being used by smugglers and the black market. Many of them have been sealed off or altered over the years, and this is making the defenders’ job harder, although it’s not the cause of the trouble. Smugglers are desperately trying to shift their wares before it is found or destroyed, and will try and kill the party if they’re discovered. </p>

<p>3. The Exigency Liaison (or another official from Centipede) is deliberately sending the PCs into a trap, to be sacrificed by the cult of Kabajij. He or she has been contacted by the cult, who are demanding powerful and wealthy sacrifices otherwise they will destroy the hold. </p>

<p>4. A planar breach (see the Planar Handbook) is responsible for the lava, and shows no signs of dissipating naturally. The PCs are charged with transporting a Portalbuster into the depths of the dwarven hold, using it to permanently seal the breach. </p>

<p> <br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">“Game of Death” </span><br />
<span style="font-style:italic">Location: Thaera <br />
Suitability: Any </span></p>

<p>The PCs are kidnapped by a deranged wizard and imprisoned in pieces on a magical game board, which resembles a deranged and chaotic version of chess. </p>

<p>The PCs (and many other monsters) are trapped within extra-dimensional spaces housed within the belly of each playing piece. A tiny barred window is the only access to the real world, but within the extra-dimensional space there is enough room for even colossal monsters. One set of pieces seems to be made of Abyssal bloodsteel; the other is made of adamantium. Even a single piece seems to be worth a King’s ransom… but alas the pieces turn into normal size game pieces if the magic is broken or they are removed from the board. </p>

<p>Their captor is deranged Thaeran wizard Manas Piraka, whose theatrical appearance and cackling mannerisms come right out of some cheap melodrama. His threats are real enough however: As each piece tries to ‘take’ another on the board, its inhabitants are forced to battle to the death. </p>

<p>The game begins with the mobile pieces stalking across the board in confusing patterns – sometimes they walk, at other times they seem simply to teleport randomly about. What little can be discerned of the rules from Manas’ mutterings seem utterly baffling and deliberately ridiculous. Manas also rants and raves at an unseen (possibly imaginary) opponent, claiming that they are cheating. </p>

<p>The PCs witness several gruesome gladiatorial spectacles. As time passes and more and more pieces are removed, the Player Characters will be forced to battle again and again; sometimes their opponent is far weaker, sometimes evenly matched… but it is clear that sooner of later, they will be matched against something that will kill them.</p>

<p>Fortunately Manas Piraka calls a recess before the characters are slaughtered. The PCs must find some way to escape before he returns or they will have to fight to the finish… and possibly again, as Manas makes no claim that he will let them go afterwards. </p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Options &amp; Complications </span></p>

<p>• The PCs are trapped within pieces on different sides. The longer they remain prisoners of the Gamemaster, the higher chance that they will be pitted against each other. </p>

<p>• The game board was once the plaything of the Emperors of Thaera – a cruel and extravagant entertainment for the ruler and his court. It was created by demons, and curses all who own it with madness. Manas Piraka was a harmless scholar of old Thaeran artefacts before finding the game, he is cursed and as much a prisoner of it as the PCs. </p>

<p>• The PCs must forge an alliance with several powerful monsters that are normally firm enemies of the Harmonium. Some may even have been prisoners since before the Thaeran Empire fell. </p>

<p>• The PCs receive help from an unexpected source: Rua – Manas Piraka’s wise and ancient raven familiar, which is clinging to sanity even though its master is not. Rua agrees to help the PCs, but only if they swear not to kill Manas. </p>

<p>• The game board warps space within it to allow for battle to take place in numerous terrains, each representing one of the outer or inner planes. </p>

<p>• The board seems to be located within an overgrown coliseum in the jungle, but if the PCs manage to escape both the board and the stadium they discover that the game is actually taking place on a floating island high above the sea. </p>

<span style="font-weight:bold">“Green Thumb” </span><br />
<span style="font-style:italic">Location: Anywhere lush and verdant <br />
Suitability: Characters with Knowledge (Nature) will have a distinct advantage… but where’s the fun in that?</span></p>

<p>Greenthumb is an elderly ogre gardener who tends a lush walled compound of rare plants. The garden is not open to the public and is in fact some distance away from any habitation. This is because several of the plants are potentially dangerous and in fact come under the Proscribed Materials Act of the OCA (they’re Class C/D items). Botanists and other scholars occasionally visit the garden for various reasons, but often defer to Greenthumb’s expertise despite his supposedly menial position. </p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Getting the PCs involved </span></p>

<p>Greenthumb’s prestige has spread to the local college, and he has been called there to give a seminar on his skills and receive an honourary award from the faculty for his services to botany. He needs someone to take over his duties temporarily, but has repeatedly found all applicants to be unsatisfactory. In desperation the College has turned to alternative sources of expertise… the PCs. </p>

<p>Harmonium PCs can be assigned by their superior (regular or exigency liaison), while freefolk might answer the general call for specialists unafraid of a little hard work and “mild peril.” Greenthumb will be away from the garden for at least four days, but shouldn’t be absent for more than a week. </p>

<p>The job sounds suspiciously simple: Guard the compound from intruders, feed and water the plants, and take care of any other problems that might crop up. The job is potentially dangerous due to the carnivorous - and mobile - nature of some of the plants, “but it’s nothing that will trouble people of your calibre” their contact insists. Greenthumb also makes it clear that any unlicensed gardening or harvesting will incur his wrath. </p>

<p>Plants and plant-like monsters in the garden might include Assassin Vines, Phantom Fungi, Shambling Mounds, Shriekers, a Tendriculos, etc. There are also various creatures with the ‘Wood Creature’ template from Manual of the Planes and as many other bizarre floral monsters and dangerous plants as the DM can find or improvise. </p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Options &amp; Complications </span></p>

<p>• Characters are expected to feed the carnivorous plants with tiny slivers of alchemically-treated meat held in a pair of tongs. The monsters have learned to tolerate Greenthumb, but won’t recognise the PCs as anything but food.</p>

<p>• One of the exhibits is a myconid or other intelligent plant creature, who begs to be released. </p>

<p>• Shriekers keep going off at all hours of the day and night, leaving the PCs tired and irritable. </p>

<p>• The shambling mound gets struck by lightning and swells in size, bursting from its pen. </p>

<p>• A local rogue slyly approaches the party and offers them a bribe to allow him access to the garden’s exotic plants. He wants to harvest a few valuable flowers, nectars, herbs, and take some cuttings. If the PCs agree to this then Greenthumb will almost certainly notice the tampering when he returns. </p>

<p>• A plant-based magical Thaeran guardian beast (use the stats for the Wood Leopard from Manual of the Planes) escapes from its cage and prowls the garden looking for victims and a way out. </p>

<p>• One of the trees is in fact a treant that’s been hiding in the garden for years. One night it wakes up and goes wondering.</p>

<p>• One of the plants is a strange crossbreed between an Assassin vine and a willow tree – use the stats for a treant with the vampire spawn template (it withers if exposed to direct sunlight). </p>

<p>• A band of drunken young nobles from the Spawn of Ruay raid the garden, looking for narcotic herbs. </p>

<p>• A burglar sneaks into the garden; his target is a green house full of rare tiger orchids from Hazhkan. </p>

<p>• A rare ‘blood jasmine’ flowers one night – attracting a flock of stirges. </p>

<p>• The garden is assaulted by a tenacious and uncannily clever colony of red ants. </p>

<p>• As evening descends a foaming madman bursts into the garden, desperately looking for belladonna (wolfsbane). He’s just been infected with lycanthropy and is desperate to find a cure. If treated too roughly he undergoes his first transformation and attacks the PCs. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">“House of Cards” </span><br />
<span style="font-style:italic">Location: Any with the Spawn of Ruay <br />
Suitability: Freefolk or noble characters would be particularly appropriate</span>.</p>

<p>PCs are hired to find the cause of some mysterious ill-fortune, which seems to be striking the Spawn of Ruay of late. In the last year and a half no less than five chapters of the organisation have been destroyed by odds mishaps: </p>

<p>• One entire group was killed by a random lightning strike while frolicking in a public fountain. </p>

<p>• One senior reveller accidentally offended the Beholder ambassador of Keln so badly that his whole group had to be arrested and removed from the Province for their own safety. </p>

<p>• One group accidentally opened a portal to the Abyss (the key was a drunken noble wearing a green sash and an admiral’s hat, swearing blasphemously at sundown on a holy day, with a monkey tittering on their left shoulder). </p>

<p>• Young Sebastion Pikarus - a notorious reveller – recently caught religion and joined a particularly harsh sect of Didairdin that preaches flagellism and stringent self denial. He’s abandoned his wealth and family, confessed his sins and the names of his fellow conspirators, and signed up on the next boat to Gelidahl. </p>

<p>• The carefree young daughter of a Cartel Baron was rendered penniless in a series of avalanching catastrophic turns of fate that began when she bought a pie from an unlicensed vendor at a public event: She carelessly discarded the greasy wrapper under the feet of a cleric of Saeduenical, who fell, which set off a number of Contingent spells, which caused a stampede, for which the young woman was eventually found liable. At the time she was heard to remark an oath to Olinem in shock at the commotion, which also lead to further investigations and the eventual downfall of all her group. </p>

<p>If they can put up with the rampant snobbery, arrogance, and drunken shenanigans of the Spawn of Ruay, investigations will eventually reveal that each chapter received a visit from a wandering nobleman a few weeks before disaster struck. The exact name, history, and description vary but high stakes card games seem to be at the heart of the matter. </p>

<p>The culprit is in fact a Rakshasa (possibly even Malik Sheyr from ‘A Sudden Change in Policy’). The Rakshasa is a member of the Harmonium, although not currently on active service. He has decided to eliminate one of the OCA’s enemies, in this case the Spawn of Ruay. To this end he has disguised himself as a travelling member of the group, a lover of high-stakes card games. In each case he ingratiates himself with some flamboyant ‘performances’ and displays of wit, but his real aim is to play cards with the senior members. Using his powers it is a relatively simple matter to amass many victories, but then he suddenly and deliberately lose to his opponents and when the stakes far exceed his supposed wealth he ‘reluctantly’ divulges his gaming secret – he owns a magical deck of cards that grant him wealth and power… These are in fact a Deck of Many Things that he tricks his fellow players into using. Unfortunately (for the Rakshasa’s victims), almost all of the beneficial cards are gone from the deck and have been replaced by non-magical forgeries. <br />
<span style="font-style:italic"><br />
Added Complications </span></p>

<p>• The Rakshasa appeals to the PCs’ loyalty to the Harmonium, and claims that he’s ridding the world of a threat to Ortho’s peace and security. </p>

<p>• To increase the challenge even further, grant the villain access to several of the beneficial effects from the Deck of Many Things. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">“Journey to the Centre of the Earth” </span><br />
<span style="font-style:italic">Location: Keln <br />
Suitability: Crisis Team</span></p>

<p>The party are summoned to an abandoned diamond mine in Keln. A venerable but particularly erratic and paranoid Beholder called Veln’veerju has apparently gone missing. Veln’veerju was a geologist, an expert in caves and caverns who preferred to be left entirely alone save for a few Grell servants. Some mishap has befallen him on an expedition deep beneath the mountains of Keln. </p>

<p>Veln’veerju disappeared some time ago although this wasn’t confirmed until much more recently: Being xenophobic and paranoid, first one beholder then another went off alone looking for Veln’veerju. None of them returned either and the Harmonium of Keln has finally decided to call in outside help. </p>

<p>Examining the beholder’s (extensive) records reveals what seems to be a creeping senility. Some years ago, Veln’veerju began investigating the possibility of harnessing Ortho’s internal ‘life force’ for the good of the Harmonium, utilising the powers beneath the surface that cause earthquakes and tidal waves. More recently however, the beholder began to believe that Ortho was somehow hollow and populated by elves, demons, and chaotic monsters that cause volcanic eruptions and earthquakes in order to destroy the Pax Harmonium. At a date shortly before his disappearance, the beholder’s scholarly hypothesis has descended into deranged and venomous ranting. </p>

<p>The PCs will be making a trip beneath the earth to rescue him and the three other beholders who went looking for him. </p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Potential Perils and Pitfalls </span></p>

<p>As well as spelunking through various caverns, the PCs will have to contend with vast vertical drops created by Veln’veerju’s Disintegrate powers. The beholder’s tunnels go down for miles, so the PCs will need a significant store of equipment, and possibly food and water (this is the sort of adventure where the DM should keep track of exactly how many oil flasks, arrows, coils of rope, etc the party take with them). </p>

<p>Aside from physical dangers of the environment (freezing waterfalls, mould-covered walls, jumps, climbing, smooth-sided mile-deep shafts, and the like), other potential hazards include: </p>

<p>• Veins of a magical Stone similar to that found in the underdark of Faerun, which blocks or warps teleportation magic. </p>

<p>• A chamber filled with combustible gas </p>

<p>• Strange acoustic phenomena that carries sound for miles and amplifies the smallest noise to cause sonic damage </p>

<p>• Fungal spores that cause hallucinations </p>

<p>• Undead grell (or beholders), but what mysterious force has animated them? </p>

<p>• Potential encounters with Aboleth, ankegs, chokers, cloakers, oozes, purple worms, ropers, troglodytes, xorn, and many other creatures… </p>

<p>Eventually the party emerges into a vast underground cavern, lit by a cloud of electrically charged gas that hovers near the ceiling (which might empower lightning-based spells). Within the cave is a forest of ancient petrified trees, an icy lake formed from underground rivers, and a jungle of giant mushrooms. Here the PCs can finally determine the fate of Veln’veerju and the other beholders: </p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Options &amp; Complications </span></p>

<p>• There really is a secret kingdom of elves, gnomes, fey, and chaotic monsters beneath the earth plotting Ortho’s destruction. They’ve captured Veln’veerju and the other beholders and are torturing them for information. </p>

<p>• The cave is home to elves who have degenerated into savage Grimlock-like creatures and no longer pose a threat to Ortho. Their once beautiful underground city is only a ruin now. </p>

<p>• The beholders were devoured by Saknussem, an ancient and terrible dragon (black dragons, deep dragons, or dracoliches work best) which has retreated far below the surface of Ortho to escape the Harmonium. </p>

<p>• All four beholders have staked a claim on the cavern and are defending it from each other in a paranoid frenzy caused by eating creatures infected by hallucinogenic fungi. </p>

<p>• The beholders (some dead, some captive) have fallen into the hands of a band of Dao and their elemental allies, who are secretly mining the area. </p>

<p>• Within the cave is a kingdom of dire ants and other monstrous insects, who rule over an enslaved population of humanoids with cruel and alien intelligence, enforcing their dominion via psionic powers. </p>

<p>• Any (or perhaps all) of the above, but it’s a hallucination caused by fungal spores. Both PCs and the beholders are affected.</p>

<p> <br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">“Fever Dreams?” </span><br />
<span style="font-style:italic">Location: Thaera <br />
Suitability: Any </span></p>

<p>The PCs are travelling along an isolated Knights’ Road, which cuts a solitary route through the Thaeran rainforest. It’s not a busy thoroughfare, and the PCs have spent the majority of their journey alone save for brightly-coloured birds and the occasional hoarse cry of a jungle cat. </p>

<p>Midway between checkpoints (at the most remote point of their journey so far) the party spies a ragged-clothed body at the side of the road, circled by hungry vultures. Responsible characters should investigate based just on that, but if they need further encouragement they may spot (DC 10) the body twitch as a vulture perches briefly on it. The unfortunate is still alive… but only barely. If rescued the figure is revealed as a dwarf female, who manages to thank them briefly and profusely before falling into an exhausted sleep. </p>

<p>An examination reveals her to be suffering from heat exhaustion, starvation, dehydration, and other signs of living rough. Infected cuts, blisters, and sores cover her face, hands, and bare feet. She also shows several signs of being delirious: fever, abnormally wide pupils, and foam around her mouth. Faint purple stains mark her cracked dry lips. </p>

<p>The dwarf’s clothes are damp, ragged, and torn, and have cut into her flesh where they’ve rubbed constantly against it. Her only equipment is a sack crudely made from a cloak. Within this are a few piles of damp purple moss, which has stained the inside of the sack. An appropriate skill roll reveals this as ‘Spirit Moss’, which was used by Thaeran shamans to induce visions. She seems to have been sucking it for moisture, and it’s quite probably responsible for her delirium. She’s in an extreme physical condition (zero hp) and shouldn’t really be moved until recovered. </p>

<p>When she regains consciousness the dwarf will be weak, delirious, and frankly a little deranged. She stumbles over her words, contradicts herself, and generally seems unsure of her surroundings and state of mind. She claims to be Faxona Dace, an entomologist. She was hired by a small Venture Company to join an expedition investigating Thaeran ruins in the jungle, but they ran afoul of “a monstrous demon” at the site. Her description of the creature are petty incoherent, and the PCs should ideally be left wondering exactly how much of her story is drug-induced. If they suggest taking her to civilisation, Faxona begs them not to delay in rescuing her companions; she claims that the demon is sacrificing her friends and performing all manner of blasphemous deeds, and will be gone by the time they return. She seems utterly convinced of this but then again it might all have been a hallucination… After days surviving only on Spirit Moss, Faxona is barely able to discern reality from nightmare. </p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Options &amp; Complications </span></p>

<p>1. Faxona is the victim of a group of bandits, who are playing on local Thaeran legends and pretending to be ‘demons’ in order to disguise their activities. They have murdered and looted the expedition, but force-fed Faxona the Spirit Moss in order to divert attention from themselves. </p>

<p>2. As above, but Faxona is actually luring them into an ambush, ready for a band of assassins hired by the PCs’ enemies. She’s spent days living rough in the forest to help authenticate her lies, and has taken far less Spirit Moss than it appears. </p>

<p>3. The Demon is real – either an actual demon, or a half-fiend or tiefling masquerading as one. </p>

<p>4. The “demon” is a Beholder, Rakshasa, or other sinister monster - but also a member of the Harmonium. If confronted by the PCs, it claims to have ‘requisitioned’ the expedition for services vital to the safety of the empire. It has the expedition members Charmed or Dominated into obeying its orders, which involve looting an ancient ruin of some powerful (and dangerously chaotic) magical crystals. The monster offers to release the expedition members if the heroes take their place (there’s no sacrificing going on, that much was fear and hallucination).</p>

<p> <br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">“Last Stand of the Trolls” </span><br />
<span style="font-style:italic">Location: The Isles of Thaera<br />
Suitability: Crisis Team </span></p>

<p>The party is dispatched by magic or airship to the depths of the Thaeran ocean. Their destination is a crusade-class ironclad called The Knight Triumphant. The mighty warship is currently holding on sea-anchor outside a tremendous storm that almost completely obscures the small tropical island at its centre. Wind and lightning constantly lashes the island, never stopping throughout the briefing (and the mission afterwards). </p>

<p>At the centre of the storm is the Isle of Haru, ancestral home of the troll race – at least according to the fleet commander who requested their presence. According to legend, in ancient times the troll race was awarded a beautiful and bountiful island home by Emperor Akamai II in exchange for service against the demon hordes of Iathra. Trolls were also at the forefront in Thaera’s war against the Knights of Harmony, causing terrible losses during the pacification. Thankfully the troll race was almost wiped out in the war; only a handful survive in the far wilderness of the world – or at least that’s what the characters have always believed. </p>

<p>In truth more than a handful of trolls survived, penned on the Isle of Haru by magic and a Harmonium fleet. Jhary himself is said to have invoked the lightning storm that keeps the trolls on the island – it strikes anyone trying to travel the storm without a protective talisman. Until now the Harmonium has maintained the prison but attempts at escape have increased of late; in response the prevailing political will has finally changed and the Harmonium has decided to deal with the ‘troll kingdom’ once and for all. </p>

<p>The characters will be transporting a magical device into the heart of Haru’s central volcano, where it will cause the mountain to erupt, destroying the island in a fiery conflagration from which nothing can escape. Even if a handful of trolls somehow manage to make it out of the lightning storm that surrounds the island, the Knight Triumphant and its fleet should be able to deal with them. End of the troll problem. </p>

<p>Along with amulets that grant immunity to lightning, the PCs are equipped with a one-of-a-kind magical device codenamed Trollslayer. It’s a large metal barrel etched with runes, around which are attached many folding protrusions that can be used to secure it in place (including canisters of Sovereign Glue). This device must be secured to the base of the volcano near an active magma flow, which should be all too easy to find once the PCs get in there. Unfortunately, Jhary’s magical storm also prevents magical delivery or any chance of an aerial assault simply ‘bombing’ the volcano from safely above, so the PCs will have to physically plant the device before making best speed back to the fleet however they can. The device takes an hour to activate fully and won’t instantaneously destroy the whole island, so they should have “plenty of time” to get clear.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Moral Troubles? </span></p>

<p>Good aligned PCs might well have some moral reservations about this job. Destroying Haru isn’t quite genocide (a few trolls are known to still lurk in other inaccessible wild places), but it’s disturbingly close. Others might have a problem with going against a plan set up by the very Knights of Harmony themselves. The commander will assure them of the utter savagery and fanatical resolve of the trolls. They have repeatedly proved themselves to be an unremitting threat to the people of the Pax Harmonium and incapable of civilisation or conversion. </p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Options &amp; Complications </span></p>

<p>• Jhary’s magic is failing for unknown reasons (perhaps simply time). The PCs have a limited amount of time to complete their quest before the storm dissipates and the trolls attempt a mass escape from Haru. </p>

<p>• As they explore the island, it becomes clear that once upon a time the trolls did have a civilisation of some kind. They created idols, made cave paintings, and even worshipped primitive versions of the Lords of Order and Chaos. Perhaps they could be converted after all… although of course not if the PCs wipe them out. </p>

<p>• The PCs somehow learn (while on the island) that the trolls have a portal that opens to different locations across the world. Normally only ‘a chosen few’ are sent through the portal, which is used by the troll king to banish his enemies – but they might use to escape the island en masse unless the PCs destroy it as well. </p>

<p>• The PCs discover that a powerful demon of old Thaera is leading the trolls, brutally subjugating them by means of its own half-fiend/half troll offspring. It is the demon which keeps urging the trolls to escape and wreak havoc in the wider world. Without its influence, perhaps they could be redeemed? </p>

<p>• The volcano is home to Blord the Weeper, a good-hearted troll who lives in seclusion from his more violent kind. Although a druid, he performs primitive rituals to Alae, taught to him by his father and his father’s father, who was taught by a shipwrecked priestess of that faith long ago. If the PCs try to unleash the volcano, they are opposed by Blord’s magic and the restless spirit of the ancient priestess, both trying to save their (unappreciative) kin.</p>       </div>

         <p><span style="font-style:italic">Part two (ran out of space above, hence the double post)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">“Needful Things”</span><br />
Location: Any prosperous farming area<br />
Suitability: Any</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">“The Kugnut Cartel is proud to present the Kugnut Wonderworld Fair! See the latest technological innovations: the mighty Steam Horse, the latest automatons, “Long Thomas” the continent’s tallest free-standing crane, and other mechanised marvels of the age of harmony. Also on show – the latest strains of engineered crops, alchemical field treatments, what’ new in almanac development, and provender magic for the discerning farmer. Come one come all!”</span></p>

<p>The party finds itself in a provender town that’s home to the extravagantly-named Kugnut Wonderworld Fair – a showcase for innovative magic and modern technology, run by the kobold cartel of the same name (with significant OCA sponsorship). Harmonium officers might be assigned here to help keep order, Cartel and Venture Company men could be sent in to examine the goods, and rich PCs might even be looking to buy a steam horse, automaton, or other technological marvel.</p>

<p>During their stay, the group is stalked by a strange automaton: It follows them through the crowded streets, ducking out of sight if it thinks it has been noticed; it also stares at the PCs in an unnerving fashion and other disturbing things. It retreats every time they try to give chase, however.</p>

<p>Eventually the machine tries to clamber into their rooms, possibly provoking a few rounds of combat before its owner arrives with the master key to shut it down. He insists that the automaton is just malfunctioning, although attentive PCs might notice (Sense Motive DC 18) that the erratic machine seemed almost intelligent and trying to silently plead for help. If they press the matter too strongly, the operator refers them to his master before removing the automaton and paying whatever compensation is appropriate (and slightly more, if he thinks the PCs can be bought off).</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">What’s Going On?</span></p>

<p>Krom Hammerstroke is a nervous dwarf merchant who owns the automaton and several more that are on show at the fair. His stock is rather basic but popular due to the fact that they sell at a noticeably cheaper price than most other machines. Krom is nervous because he and his chief enchanter, a wizard called Eddly Forgail, are running a very dangerous con trick:</p>

<p>The rogue automaton (and the others) are not powered by Cog Spirits but elementals. They’re actually regular - and illegal - golems. Eddly’s use of the forbidden enslaving magic to create the golems has allowed them to undercut several of the normal costs. While superficially similar to automatons (including their vulnerability to a master key), each carries the risk of going berserk if attacked or otherwise disturbed. The golem that approached the PCs has already “gone rogue” and is being kept carefully under wraps at Hammerstroke’s warehouse.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Optional Encounters &amp; Developments</span></p>

<p>1. One of the golems goes berserk when local urchins ‘attack’ it with stones. Its raging blows trigger other golems and soon there is a stampede of rampaging golems at the fair.</p>

<p>2. Burrowdogs are prowling the fair.</p>

<p>3. A large number of thieves and con artists are working the crowds.</p>

<p>4. Krom is aware that something underhand is going on, but not exactly what. Eddly Forgail offered to provide cheap automatons for a cut of the profits – the wizard is the real villain.</p>

<p>5. Krom is only acting this way because his father Huki Hammerstroke is a compulsive gambler and wastrel drunk. Huki lost the family fortune to a string of gaming houses and Krom’s dwarfish sense of family honour is compelling him to pay his father’s debts, keep the family business running, and stop the scandal from becoming public knowledge.  </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">“Rustlers”</span><br />
Location: Any Rural<br />
Suitability: Venture Companies would be particularly appropriate</p>

<p>The PCs are passing an isolated village built on several terraces cut out of the mountainside. Beneath them rove herds of cattle, massive beasts clearly bred with magical or alchemical aid. The smell of blood and cooked beef is heavy in the air as the PCs approach a roadside settlement, another unnamed ‘checkpoint town’ on a backwater road. The smell is billowing out of a combined slaughterhouse and processing plant that dominates the hamlet.</p>

<p>The party encounters a small party of angry farmers and a single beleaguered Harmonium officer at the checkpoint. This is Thieftaker Bulwyf (Notary 4), a steely-eyed no-nonsense orcish ranger. His terse reassurances are doing little to ease the crowd’s mood. The PCs can act to calm the situation or not as they wish, but eventually the meeting disperses with nobody looking particularly happy. Afterwards Bulwyf will explain the situation to the PCs:</p>

<p>Cattle are being pilfered from the farms – not so many that the Harmonium considers it worth dispatching a force to investigate, but enough that the poor farmers are up in arms. Bulwyf has seen tracks that seem to indicate ogres are responsible, but he needs help if he’s to confront them. The taciturn orc has therefore decided to recruit the party, one way or another. Perhaps he makes a formal request for aid, or is prepared to pay them or overlook some irregularity in their papers - maybe he threatens to find an irregularity in their papers if they don’t help him, or just refuses to stamp them if they don’t “act harmonious” and help out.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Who might be the culprits?</span></p>

<p>1. Lazy ogre workers from the area, who are sneaking off to hold drunken parties in the wilderness. One of the ogres is a strange but charismatic traveller from afar (actually an ogre mage in disguise), who speaks of legends and ancient times. The parties are slowly developing from drunken gatherings to something almost religious, a cult of gluttony and fertility, worshipping the Black Root.</p>

<p>2. The rustlers are Ogres, but outsiders. They are henchmen of a corrupt cartel baron for whom most of the local ranchers are tenants. His ogres are stealing the cattle, which the farmers are then liable to pay for the replacement of. A few weeks after paying up, the very same cattle are returned to the farms by the wicked baron, and the whole process begins over again. The ogre base in the hills is practically a fully-functioning ranch.</p>

<p>3. As above, but the baron’s henchmen are local ogres tempted into crime.</p>

<p>4. The ogres (either locals or a wandering Labour Clan) are infected wereboars. Afraid of what will happen to them if they are discovered, the ogres are stealing cattle to devour when the change (and gluttonous hunger) grips them at the full moon. They don’t want to hurt anyone, but can’t control themselves during this time. A few cows taken into the wilderness is the safest option in their opinion.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">“Stalkers”</span><br />
Location: Anywhere beholders could turn up and cause trouble<br />
Suitability: Harmonium</p>

<p>The ‘Blind Revolt’ is a little-known insurrection that occurred only two years after the Beholders of Keln joined the Alliance of Harmony (the future ‘Pax harmonium’). An alliance of ten beholders struck against the Knights’ retainers and the new loyalists. Their revolution against harmony was short-lived however - Jhary of Heka was on hand to deal with the insurrection before it could escalate.</p>

<p>Jhary defeated the beholders, but allowed them to live. For their crimes however he demanded they each give up an eyestalk to him, as token of their submission. Worse than the shame and affront of the ‘toll’ was the fact that Jhary made certain each severed stalk would never regenerate, leaving the rebels permanently maimed. They lost their positions and vanished into obscurity, known to their follow countrymen only as The Blind Ten.</p>

<p>Unbeknown to the general populace, Jhary kept the Ten Blinded Eyes and preserved them for his own use. In time, he passed them on… and eventually they found a home in various treasuries, museum collections, and private hordes, all of which are conveniently located wherever the PCs happen to be.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Getting the PCs involved</span></p>

<p>Prior to the adventure’s start, a number of thefts have disturbed the city: A break in at a museum, a couple of private houses, even the office of a senior officer at a Harmonium campus. Half a dozen break-ins are distressing and noteworthy but not quite cause for alarm.</p>

<p>Then increasing numbers of beholders suddenly descend on the area. Some are private citizens; others are Harmonium and OCA members. All are angry, suspicious, and not in a mood for diplomacy. They start poking their (proverbial) noses into the investigations and begin throwing their weight around among both the underworld, the Free Folk, and the Hardhead hierarchy. </p>

<p>Their spokesperson is Zin’zr’Gor, a pitiless beholder cleric of the Lord of Watchfulness. It demands assistance in “correcting a severe breach of the peace and a grievous insult to the Beholder Nation.” He’s accompanied by a beholder lawyer and a diplomat, both of whom threaten dire repercussions (within the law, although they won’t initially admit that) if the matter is not resolved. </p>

<p>Harmonium PCs are assigned to solve the problem before things degenerate even further – and to be frank, just about everyone has a vested interest in stopping the beholders before things get worse. Less honest characters might also want the artifacts for themselves.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">What’s happening?</span></p>

<p>The <span style="font-style:italic">Ten Blinded Eyes</span> are being stolen, one by one. The beholders didn’t even know the Eyes had been kept - let alone transformed into magic items, dumped carelessly in museums and treasuries, and now LOST by the Harmonium. The beholders consider all of these things to be grave insults and are demanding justice, recompense, and the Eyes.</p>

<p>1. The Eyes are being stolen by a blind free folk wizard called Jenos Froissart. A diviner by trade, he was blinded by the Beholders for spying and doesn’t have the record or influence to receive the appropriate healing spells. He thinks that the Eyes are both an excellent aid and suitable revenge.</p>

<p>2. The eyes are being stolen by grimlocks, who have clawed their way up to the surface at the behest of their shaman. </p>

<p>3. Several underworld figures, adventurers, and corrupt Harmonium officials (including several beholders) have heard about The Eyes are trying to steal them. Numerous individuals have different Eyes and the criminals are attacking and robbing each other as well as the lawful owners.</p>

<p>4. The Eyes are being sought by the Blind Ten, who have learned where they are at last. They plan to regain their eyes and re-enter beholder politics enhanced by Jhary’s magic on their stolen stalks. Such former rebels making a bid for power is clearly a threat to the Pax Harmonium’s relationship with Keln.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">“The Riddle of Bawdy Bess”</span><br />
Location: Harmony’s Glory (or any major Licensed Quarter)<br />
Suitability: Any</p>

<p>Bawdy Bess - undisputed ‘Queen of the Licensed Quarter’ - has expired after 60 sensuous years of notorious work in the pleasure trade. Struggling up from the lowest rung of society, she’s been a courtesan, a madam, and finally a public representative and champion of the free folk. Grief is palpable on the streets of the Licensed Quarter, but so is greed and here’s why:</p>

<p>Bawdy Bess (alias Elzbeth Hudd, freeblade and adventurer) died this very night under mysterious circumstances, during the climax of a riotous Quarter-wide street party held to celebrate her seventy-third birthday. The body was intact and there was even a relaxed smile on her face, but before the Drunk Patrol could arrive to take custody of the scene, her body was stolen from the House of Oils (the bawdyhouse she owned). Despite the scandal, that’s not what has people so interested.</p>

<p>Bawdy Bess kept an infamous ‘appointment book’ throughout her career, in which she recorded details of each and every client, their various letters, gifts, and endearments, and other juicy items of gossip. The book was famous – a magical tome that could shrink to minute size and record an infinite number of pages (for this alone most mages would love to find it, if the legends are true!) More important than that however are the countless blackmail opportunities contained within. Who knows how many of the city’s illustrious leaders (past and present), ambassadors, cartel lords, and military men she may have had as clients over the years. The only clue to the book’s whereabouts is a cryptic hint she once let slip to a trusted aide; that she kept the book “close to that which my heart felt most fond of.”</p>

<p>The Licensed Quarter is officially closed “until the sacrilegious theft of a body” is resolved, trapping free folk and nobleman alike win the district. A manic mob has formed: A third of them is clamouring to be let out, a third is desperately searching for the body or the book, and a third are so stupefied on wine or drugs that they don’t know what they’re doing… and there’s a similar crowd outside clambering to be let in as well.</p>

<p>The hunt is on!</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Complications</span></p>

<p>1. One or more PCs are already severely drunk or drug-addled when the adventure starts</p>

<p>2. One or more PC names are in the book.</p>

<p>3. There is no book - it was a ruse maintained by Bess to protect herself.</p>

<p>4. Many powerful people each send agents to secure the book “at all costs.”</p>

<p>5. Bess’ body has been stolen by an insane obsessed necromancer who plans unspeakable things for the lady’s corpse</p>

<p>6. Bess was never dead – she’s escaping Harmonium justice and leaving a very memorable goodbye in her wake to distract everyone</p>

<p>7. She’s dead, but her last wishes were for the free folk to steal her body and cause as much trouble (and fun) as possible.</p>

<p>8. Bess was a vampire – or recently became one</p>

<p>9. All of the above is true</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">“Underworld”</span><br />
Location: Any major city<br />
Suitability: Free Folk/Thieves</p>

<p>PCs rogues receive word that a local underworld contact wants to see them with a potential job. Workers excavating a new extension to the city’s sewers and cisterns broke into an ancient tomb complex. They also set off a deadly trap so the Harmonium ordered the hole sealed, the work shut down, and the dig site closed. Harmonium officers (low level but real soldiery, not the Civil Patrol) are guarding the site just in case, but it was also sealed by wizardry (a Wall of Stone spell). The authorities are just waiting until a Crisis Team can be assigned to the task. The bureaucracy seems to be in no hurry however, so the underworld has decided to take advantage of the situation with some quiet pilfering.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">What’s Inside?</span></p>

<p>1. The complex is the tomb of an ancient King, dating from far before the time of the Harmonium. Priestly magic and ghostly guardians stand vigil over this mighty lord and his treasures.</p>

<p>2. The complex is the secret treasury of one of the vanished Thief Lords, whose guild was destroyed by the Knights of Harmony. It contains the ill-gotten gains of the Lord and his thieves, which the Knights never claimed. Elaborate death traps fill the hideout.</p>

<p>3. The complex is the base of a chaotic cult, which sealed themselves away deep below the earth when the Harmonium conquered the land. Alone in the darkness, they have degenerated into primitive inbred savagery. </p>

<p>4. The complex is a vault storing various banned texts, forbidden religious treatises, chaotic magical items, and other dangerous treasures (a <span style="font-style:italic">Wand of Wonder</span>, a <span style="font-style:italic">Deck of Many Things</span>, etc). It was deliberately hidden from the Harmonium long ago by an alliance of chaos-aligned wizards.</p>

<p>5. The complex is a tomb housing the bodies of soldiers from the War of Iron, infected with terrible Abyssal diseases. They were sealed alive beneath the city. The Harmonium actually has no intention of exploring the complex and is just going to seal it up again (maybe with some infected workmen locked inside).</p>

<p>6. The complex is home to a lich, remnant of one of the nine cabals. The lich and his undead servants are quietly waiting out the centuries in private. She (currently) means no harm to anyone, but the Harmonium certainly won’t see things that way. If they make peaceful contact with the Lich and explain the situation, she will resign herself to flight. In exchange for a portion of her treasure, she asks them to help spirit her, her equipment, and her servants out of the city to some place safe.</p>

<p>Armed with several scrolls of Passwall (to bypass the Wall of Stone sealing the entrance), the PCs must sneak past the Harmonium guards WITHOUT causing an alarm or any deaths, and make a secret raid (possibly more than one) on the dungeon for loot. Their contact expects at least 20% of the take, as well as remuneration for any other help he provides them (like scrolls of Passwall).</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Added Complications</span></p>

<p>1. If the DM is feeling particularly evil, they can infest the dungeon with scroll-eating mould or mites, which will swiftly devour the party’s stock of Passwall scrolls (and paper for mapping!) forcing them to search for some other method of escape – either a second entrance they can force open or a magical item they can use to escape.</p>

<p>2. Of course if the PCs linger too long in the tomb they might find themselves confronted by the Exigency Team sent in to investigate the find (an opportunity for an unusual alliance if they too are affected by the ‘scroll mites’).</p>

<p>3. If you’re using option 5 above, then the Harmonium might seal the tomb while the PCs are still inside, trapping them within.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">“Wanted Wands”</span><br />
Location: Any location that’s hard to get away from <br />
Suitability: Harmonium officers (especially a PC graduate of the School of Ethics) would be particularly appropriate</p>

<p>Titus Pulch is a simple-minded but loyal ogre who’s inordinately proud of reaching the heady heights of Notary Two in the Harmonium. He’s rough and ill-disciplined but good-hearted and devoted to the Harmonium. It’s therefore surprising to hear one day that he’s been confined to the campus stockade on charges of corruption.</p>

<p>Divinations have revealed that Titus committed the crimes, but magical questioning has as yet failed to prove his protestations and denials to be lies. Zin’zr’Gor, a pitiless beholder cleric of the Lord of Watchfulness is the prosecuting officer of the Courts Martial, and he’s convinced that Titus is guilty. The PCs have only a few days to prove him innocent.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Getting the PCs involved</span></p>

<p>1. PC Harmonium officers could be friends with Titus Pulch, and may even have served with him, been his commanding officer, or have inducted him into the Harmonium in the first place.</p>

<p>2. Free Folk adventurers may well know Titus from his visits to the Licensed Quarter, where he’s a regular and popular feature. He asks the PCs to help him because the Harmonium are convinced that he’s guilty.</p>

<p>3. The Ogre elders of the city ask the party to intervene. They are particularly concerned that such a good example of their race has been put behind bars. Titus could also turn out to be a PC ogre’s cousin.</p>

<p>Titus Pulch is accused of “demanding money with menaces” from several merchants and shady characters that live and work in the poorer tenements of the city. His reputation as a drinker, gambler, and brawler aren’t doing him any favours either.</p>

<p>A trio of Snake Dancers are responsible (perhaps even the same ones as those from “Checkpoint” above). Imprisoned for previous crimes, they’ve managed to escape and are loose in the city and looking for a way out. Their powers can’t just conjure up travel papers however, so they’re having to pay the local underworld boss a hefty bribe to be smuggled out given that the guards are prepared and looking for them.  They’ve been using their powers to persuade Titus to “tax” a number of disreputable folk (minor enemies and annoyances of the crime boss), then casting Modify Memory to cloud the ogre’s recollections of his crimes. </p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Proving Titus Innocent</span></p>

<p>A successful Sense Motive check might reveal the gaps in Notary Pulch’s memory, and repeated use of spells will not prove that Titus is lying (because he’s not), but Zin’zr’Gor will require far more than that if Titus is to escape the ‘justice’ of the Lord of Watchfulness. </p>

<p>Investigations in the slums will reveal that all of the victims were enemies of a certain (reputed) crime lord… looking for them there might eventually reveal the culprits hidden among the poor and desperate, surrounded by a bodyguard of Charmed thugs. If the PCs are prepared to pay however (in gold or favours), the crime lord will turn the Snake Dancers in himself.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

          Ortho: 101 Orthorian Adventures        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>I think it'd be better if we made a Net-Supplement to this, Armoury.  It could be a "Ready made and Easy to use" Netbook with a 101 Adventure Hooks about Ortho, Sigil, and the Planes.</p>

<p>It would take a long time to make but it'd probably be easier to write than anything else.</p>

<p>We could call it <span style="text-decoration:underline">Planescape Jaunts:  Adventure Hooks for Third Edition</span></p>

<p>Here's two more submissions.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Akashi's Revenge</span></p>

<p>Location: Any<br />
Suitability: Mid To High Level</p>

<p>A terrifying plague has spread through portions of the Harmonium's Provinces and killed hundreds of individuals in a disgustingly brutal manner.  Akashi the Destroyer then appeared to the Octave in an <span style="font-style:italic">Projected Image</span> and made demands for a vast amount of wealth to be delivered or he will release the plague on other cities throughout the Provinces of Ortho.</p>

<p>Now the Harmonium cannot yield to terrorism but a few private groups have done some calculating and believe that the price Akashi demands is fairly reasonable by comparison to the catastrophic losses that the government will face if the plague is released.  Besides, they're rather glad to hear that Akashi is starting to become reasonable.</p>

<p>The PCs have been asked to investigate the situation and determine if it really is Akashi making these demands since he's never been interested in gold before.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Potential Perils and Pitfalls</span></p>

<p>* The Government has dispatched several teams other than the PCs and some of them are under orders to guarantee their secrecy by any means necessary.  Others are afraid that the PCs will disrupt the unstable situation and set about to eliminate them.</p>

<p>* A group of Black Alchemists are very interested in acquiring samples of Akashi's Plague and desire to sell it to the Doomguard.  They offer to enrich the PCs greatly if they can get the purified form or spell.  If the PCs refuse, they will be dogged by their agents.</p>

<p>* Akashi's minions are on the look out for any Harmonium agents and they're quite interested in silencing them if it looks like the PCs aren't there to pay the tremendous ransom.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Options and Complications</span></p>

<p>* It's not Akashi but a renegade member of the Church of Alzrius who doesn't actually believe the real one is alive.  The fellow has <span style="font-style:italic">Polymorphed</span> himself into the image of an Elf and decided to extort an extreme amount of money from the Harmonium with a famous visage.</p>

<p>The real Akashi will take the impersonation of an Elf, let alone himself, very seriously.  His own minions will far more chaotic and dangerous as well.</p>

<p>* The actual plague isn't a creation of the False Akashi but a result of a meteorite that struck the planet from beyond the Crystal Sphere.  The lifeform is mutating rapidly and needs to be destroyed before it becomes capable of devastating the whole of Ortho.</p>

<p>* The PCs may well find their way to the real Akashi the Destroyer's secret hideout in the Isles of Thaera.  If they can manage to follow up the lead then they have the potential for striking at one of the most fearsome evils on Ortho directly.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">The Red Letter Affair</span></p>

<p>Location: Divinity's Glory<br />
Suitability: Any</p>

<p>The PCs are privately approached by Terrance Greywords on a personal errand.  They are to deliver some private government correspondence along with some personal letters to a friend that's travelling to Sigil.  </p>

<p>Almost immediately, they are arrested by Harmonium officials and the correspondance confiscated.  If they manage to escape then they are still labeled as fugitives from the law and find out that Terrance has been arrested on charges of treason.  The letters, whether they are in the Harmonium's possession or not, are said to be proof that Terrance conspired to overthrow the Planar Harmonium and helped in the assassination of Factol Sarrin.</p>

<p>If the PCs do read the letters then they find out Terrance was set to do some private negotiating with the Doomguard for magical weaponry to use against Devils (not really illegal), intended to visit the headquarters of the Indeps in the Outlands (scandalous but barely newsworthy), and was having an affair with a Princess on Meter (only a major issue on Meter).</p>

<p>If they do get arrested then they're likely to be shipped off to a prison in South Thaera to be made to disappear.  If they arrive there, it'll be difficult but not impossible to escape.  Unfortunately, if they take up any offers to escape then they're almost certain to be either spies or supporters of Terrance whom want to get him out of jail by any means necessary.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Potential Perils and Complications</span></p>

<p>* Terrance is a member of the Royal Family in Heka-Voll and the Harmonium has drastically underestimated the result of arresting him.  There have been lynchings, riots, and even the expelling of foreign diplomats.  No one is quite sure what to do when Prince Rohmel's homeland is in a state of near-insurrection.</p>

<p>* The PCs are dogged by various groups that are certain they have the <span style="font-style:italic">real</span> letters even if they've given up their versions.  These include Terrance's supporters, members of the Church, and conspiracy theorists that are certain he's done something nefarious.</p>

<p>* Faith has never particularly liked Terrance Greywords.  Her husband never had a good word to say about the man and Terrance deliberately blocked Sarrin's rise to power as best he could.  Faith wants the situation investigated thoroughly, though will probably do a double take when she discovers is his half-brother (Factol Sarrin also being from Heka-Voll and disliking speaking of his mother's divorce from Terrance's father).</p>

<p>She wants answers and the Planar Harmonium has dispatched to involve themselves.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Options</span></p>

<p>* Terrance is actually guilty of arranging the assassination a previous Harmonium Factol with an Xaocist friend and/or helping the Revolutarionary League make one of their members Factol.  A disgruntled Planar Harmonium Hardhat has no proof of these allegations and simply found it easier to use Greyword's propensity for secret correspondence to let hysteria do the job for her.</p>

<p>She intends to kill Terrance as soon she's managed to draw out his supporters and destroy his reputation.</p>

<p>* The responsible party is, actually, Terrance Greywords.  He's spread the rumors about the correspondence and "secret code" that implicates him.  Faced with an opportunity to finally destroy their enemy, Terrance has managed to smoke out a lot of his more secretive foes.  The PCs are but chess pawns in what will soon be a wave of mass arrests and executions of people against the Chaotically minded Representative.</p>

<p>That is, if he's not executed by the panicking conspirators first.</p>

<p>* The letters are actually the proof that everyone is looking for.  They just struck too soon.  The Doomguard weapons, Indeps, and Meter Princess are all part of a conspiracy that he's arranging to invade South Thaera.  Terrance intends to decimate what he percieves as a hellhole of evil and cripple the Harmonium's military heart.  Forcing the Harmonium to rebuild it as a decent place to live is secondary.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

          Ortho: 101 Orthorian Adventures        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Hurray, two more on the way to 101!</p>

<p>I certainly like the two adventures - particularly the <span style="font-style:italic">will the real Akashi please stand up?</span> option, and the chance for the <span style="font-weight:bold">Red Letter Affair</span> to degenerate into a total farce of competing factions, lies, spies, fake letters, etc.</p>

<p>As to making it a netbook rather than a release with the rest of Ortho... dunno. Ultimately page count usually determines these things (the printed PDF I have is pretty huge, and this thread is large already), so I get your point. In my experience though its the sample adventures section that usually brings a new setting book to life; maybe we could cherry-pick a few of the adventures for the main book and use the rest in a suppliment? I don't want to put the cart before the horse however - there's plenty of work to do (and at the least another 60 adventures!) for the main book. Fair point though.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

          Ortho: 101 Orthorian Adventures        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>FYI, my favorite of the works has to be the Prostitution plot followed by the Cult of Empty Heaven write up.  Both are wonderfully well handled in the role of scandal on Ortho.</p>

<p>23. <span style="font-weight:bold">The Codex of The Nine Winds</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Location</span>: Any<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Suitability</span>: Mid to High Level</p>

<p>A monk of Didairdin from Shoryko comes to visit the PCs with a problem.  She requests that the PCs be willing to handle the issue with a tremendous amount of discretion.  Provided that she can recieve the PCs assurances, she explains that she is from Mount Kotai.  The vast mountain training facility where countless monks of Didairdin learn the ways of discipline and mastering the martial arts.</p>

<p>Recently, a student of their organization poisoned one of the Grandmasters of the organization and proceeded to make off with one of their most priceless relics.  The <span style="font-style:italic">Codex of the Nine Winds</span>.  The book is a minor artifact that has been blessed by the gods and provides a chance for a warrior to tremendously improve his fighting abilities.   The monk says that the reputation of Mount Kotai is at stake if it comes out that they had one of their most legendary champions killed and were robbed as well.  She wants the book returned and the perpetrator punished.</p>

<p>What the monk is avoiding saying is that the Codex is an artifact blessed by both Didairdin and Jislana.  Only the highest masters of the order can study it because the book reveals that there was a time that the gods were slightly friendlier than they are today.  It would also result in the book being confiscated to be burned.  The book's magical properties are also of note, any reader can transform his existing Fighter levels into that of a Martial Adepts.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Potential Perils and Pit Falls</span></p>

<p>* The thief is actually part of a gang of Alzius and Chaos worshippers that are all extremely talented but in need of an edge over the rest of the Harmonium.  Their reading of the book has given them all "themes" to their new Martial Adept powers and they are eager to cause havok across Ortho as a result.</p>

<p>Keeping this matter a secret won't be possible for long.</p>

<p>* A group of high level Monk/Rogue/Assassins from Mount Kotai have been dispatched to deal with the issue as well.  They flee whenever they feel that they cannot kill all witnesses without drawing more attention and foolishly attempt to engage PCs on an individual level due to their overconfidence.</p>

<p>The number of corpses building up should appall PCs like it does their Monk companion.</p>

<p>* Po Ji is broken from his current meditation by these events.  The Wanderer interested in recovering the book himself.  The Swordsage considers the monks of Kotai to be thieves and blasphemers whom have dishonored Jislana by concealing her role in their order.</p>

<p>He has no interest in hurting anyone over the sacred tome but his presence causes a lot of people to break out their 'big guns' when they shouldn't.  He's best dealt with diplomacy.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Options and Complications</span></p>

<p>* The Monk in their accompaniment is actually an avatar of Jislana.  Jislana has decided that the monks have become too high bound and secretive for her sake.  The PCs involvement is to throw a wrench in their plans and expose the festering corruption that has become the honored Monastic Order.</p>

<p>* The Codex is potentially part of a larger series of volumes that have the power to transform reasonably skilled mid-level fighters into ridiculous powerhouses.  The Harmonium would almost certainly want these books for themselves, disregarding the spiritual teachings in their desire to create an army of superpowered warriors.</p>

<p>Can the PCs gather all the volumes together themselves or will they destroy them to save the world from a terrifying future of godlike warriors duking it out for their own will?</p>

<p>* The Monk is actually the person who poisoned the Grandmaster.  She is aware that the 'thieves' are actually a plot to increase the respect of the martial arts in the greater world of Ortho by exposing how helpless and ineffective the Harmonium is at stopping them.</p>

<p>The Monks of Kotai will try to kill her as a result when they find her.</p>

<p>24. <span style="font-weight:bold">Bug Hunt</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Location</span>: Any<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Suitability</span>: Mid-Level</p>

<p>	The PCs are detoured from a number of their usual stops by the Harmonium as its fairly clear that there's something going on by the number of injured and dislocated citizens that they're encountering.  Finally, when they've moved to an overcrowded village to handle their business, the entire town is attacked by Formians.  The Formians attack with unusual levels of hostility and seem determined to slaughter everything before they're put down.</p>

<p>	The PCs are then informed by the Harmonium that the Formians on Nemausus have tried an unusual tactic.  They've located the planet of Ortho and dispatched "seed pods" to the planet in order to start the colonization of the world.  The Harmonium has full orders to destroy them all before they start spreading across the planet but this Hive has proven particularly virulent.</p>

<p>	If the PCs don't volunteer, the base commander is willing to "Draft" them in order to join the fight to destroy the bugs before they overwhelm this region.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Potential Perils and Pit Falls</span></p>

<p>* The Camp Commander has made a deal with the Devil.  Sick of his forces being destroyed, he's commissioned an explosive device from South Thaera at the mere price of his soul.  The PCs are expected to deliver the weapon into the Queen's nest and blow it sky high.</p>

<p>What they won't be told is that their accompaniment will be disguised Abishani that have orders to collect a Queen egg and some Royal Jelly.</p>

<p>* The PCs will be taken off guard by a bunch of Githzerai warriors (Xaocists) that arrive with a set of magical weapons and devices.  They've <span style="font-style:italic">Plane Shifted</span> to Ortho to continue the fight against the forces of Law but found better prey.</p>

<p>The Camp Commander wants the PCs to slaughter then since they've killed harmonium troops but they can be recruited at the PCs possible arrest to fight the Bugs.</p>

<p>* The Bugs seem to multiplying at a rate that is far in excess of what is normal for even their prolific race and the PCs should speculate that the Formians need to be contained here or lose the entire planet.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Options and Complications</span></p>

<p>* Akashi the Destroyer is the party responsible for this particular variant of the Formians.  The insane Priest of Alzrius has used some Black Alchemist associates with his own magic to warp the spirits of the Formian Queen to Chaotic Evil.  He's also made them reach maturity far quicker.</p>

<p>It is his hope that if this test proves successful, he'll move a dozen more Super-Queens across Ortho and watch civilzation decay.</p>

<p>* The Formians have started preparing a series of magical gates that they intend to bring in large numbers of their troops through.  These things will be "grown" with the aid of humans having their psionic potential tapped thanks to some Illithid allies.</p>

<p>If the PCs don't blow up these gates in addition to their regular mission then Ortho will have a lot of problems soon.  However, the Harmonium troops beside them refuse to break orders.</p>

<p>* This is all a breakdown in communication.  A massive peace delegation had their <span style="font-style:italic">Gate</span> spell go array and they were immediately attacked when they arrived in the wrong location.  The Queen has been badly injured and the military is in charge of protecting the group.  They, erroneously, assume this is a general attack on their personage.</p>

<p>Ironically, the mission is to negotiate a possible withdraw of Nemausus' citizenry back to Arcadia or other reasonable compromise.</p>

<p>25. <span style="font-weight:bold">The Return of the Factol</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Location</span>: Harmony's Glory<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Suitability</span>: Any</p>

<p>Factol Sarrin has been resurrected by the will of  Didairdin and returned as a full blown Proxy of said God.  He's returned wielding the full power of the gods, his might as a Paladin, and a righteous glow about him.  The Harmonium is somewhat unused to flat out <span style="font-style:italic">miracles</span> occurring but they manage to adjust reasonably well.</p>

<p>That is, until Factol Sarrin makes it clear that he's come to rebuild the Temple in three days.</p>

<p>The Factol claims that the Harmonium has made grevious errors in rewriting the nature of the gods to their own will, in refusing to own up to the horrors of the past, in allying with Devils, and also needlessly persecuting the followers of good but Un-Ordered Gods.  Almost immediately, the Harmonium decides to shut him up before he causes more trouble.</p>

<p>That's right when he does something damn near unimaginable.  Possibilities include successfully moving Nemausus back to Arcadia, renegotiating R'Talnir's return to the Harmonium, or successfully destroying Akashi the Destroyer for the final (?) time.  Now, Factol Sarrin is damn near immune to criticism and eagerly awarded a position as Octave along with relative freedom to announce his views.  Unfortunately, despite every trick in the book.....Sarrin is being heard on them.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Getting the PCs involved</span></p>

<p>* The PCs are hired by Faith to investigate whether the man is really her husband.  Despite the fact he's been back for over a month, they haven't yet spoken and she's outraged at the possibility he's a fake.   She's not terribly happy on the prospect she's unimportant to her husband if he's real either.</p>

<p>* The PCs are hired by Terrance Greywords to investigate.  Unlike Faith, he's absolutely <span style="font-style:italic">sure</span> his returned half-brother is a fake.  Terrance dances around it but after getting proof he's a fake, he wants this imposter killed and it to be done painfully.</p>

<p>* The Church of the Lords of Order want this issue carefully handled as well.  A lot of controversy is floating around this issue but Sarrin is gaining a rapid set of followers.  If it turns out he is an agent of their gods then excommunicating him could destroy the Church.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Potential Perils and Pit Falls</span></p>

<p>* With few exceptions, the Octave wants Sarrin dead.  A martyr is a problem but they have plenty of experience in slandering a man after death.  The Octave intends to dispatch any number of assassins and individuals designed to frame Sarrin for crimes of ignomity.</p>

<p>* The Planar Harmonium has rallied behind their former commander and a lot of them are eager to see his return to full power.  This has lead a lot of people to be very peery about people looking into his matters and the PCs may thus be assaulted because of it.</p>

<p>* A large number of Devils have been dispatched to destroy Sarrin and his followers.  No one can figure out where the Hell they're all coming from and destroying them is a major issue for anyone who wants to protect Sarrin's flock.</p>

<p>The most likely explanation is that it's South Thaera taking a direct attack against something they percieve as a danger.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Options and Complications</span></p>

<p>* Factol Sarrin IS what he claims to be.  Didairdin felt the need to get the Harmonium back on track and felt that Sarrin was one of the few people with his heart in the right place.  Unfortunately, Sarrin feels overwhelmed by this task and is pretty sure it's destined to end in total tragedy.  He's unwilling to visit his wife and kids because he's fairly sure he'll have to die to see this through.</p>

<p>He may or may not be right.</p>

<p>* Factol Sarrin is real....and not.  A <span style="font-style:italic">Clone</span> created by the Lich of Composer Julhein, this Sarrin is part of an elaborate plot to overthrow the government using populist positions.  Either Sarrin will suceed and become Composer, in which Julhein will <span style="font-style:italic">Magic Jar</span> his creation then rule Ortho again or the Octave will be destroyed in civil war.  Julhein would then proceed to 'step up' to the plate with his own candidates.</p>

<p>Morally ambiguous PCs may note that Julhein is sincere in the fact that he'll scale back the cultural oppression in the Harmonium, it'll just be more focused on political expansion than idealogical.  I.e. He'll be continuing Ortho's Empire Building, but cut back on the torture and conversion to Lawfulness.</p>

<p>* The Trickster has successfully fused his avatar with a young Doppleganger from Sigil that admired Sarrin.  Thus, the figure possesses the power to mimic Sarrin perfectly.  The Chaotic figure intends to shake up as much of Ortho as possible before he grows bored with it.</p>

<p>At heart, he's most interested in shattering the Harmonium's perception of the truth.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Hmm, resurrecting Sarin would be a pretty big change to PS canon. If we got that route, we need to tread carefully. I also don't like the idea of him becoming an Octave because the only vacant position is currently being held by his wife. I was actually considering writing a whole adventure (after we finish the PDF, naturally) dealing with the circumstances of Conductor Vyliss' death, why Faith has the job now (she was the highest ranking person in the department who wasn't crazy, evil, or both), and who the Council will pick to fill the position permanently. It'd be a shame to waste that. Also, don't you think Sarin coming back from the dead is maybe a <span style="font-style:italic">bit</span> to juicy to be just an adventure hook?</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Well Adventure Hooks are not necessarilly canon, especially with their multiple endings.</p>

<p>Though if you're interested in exploring the issue beyond just an adventure hook then we certainly could.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>You really don't think very highly of the Harmonium's upper eschelons, do you?    <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/lol.png" title="Laughing out loud" alt="Laughing out loud" class="smiley-content"/>  <br />
Oh well, if the Octave is mostly full of bastards, I guess we should blame Duckluck  <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/lol.png" title="Laughing out loud" alt="Laughing out loud" class="smiley-content"/> </p>

<p>Nice writeups. I like all three adventure hooks. Yes, Sarrin's return would be a major plot-twist but they're only adventure seeds as you pointed out. The return of Sarrin and the real deal with Faith <span style="font-style:italic">would </span>make a great adventure if we could combine them - after the main books finished, obviously.</p>

<p>PS: I think the full writeup of Akashi needs your attention asap... I love a villain who's speciality is "inevitable comeback!"  <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/cool.png" title="Cool" alt="Cool" class="smiley-content"/></p> <div class="dice_rolls">
