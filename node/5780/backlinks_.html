</div> <p><p>The worship of Slavic powers has been in decline for several centuries now. On many Prime Material Worlds their followers have converted to other religions, often monotheistic ones – it is known that the pantheon has been pushed out of least three worlds by Taiia the Maker only. That is why the Slavic powers are always on the lookout for young civilizations, unsophisticated, unclaimed by more powerful gods, and easily impressed.</p><p>Almost all mortals that worship the Slavic powers today belong to barbaric, warlike, often nomadic cultures. They worship simple concepts – Sun, Wind, Warrior, Mother – and the gods morph to meet their needs. It's a vicious circle: the powers are forced to simplify their own nature and not stray far from the &quot;divine elemental&quot; theme in order to survive, but doing this all but guarantees that they will never return to their former stature, and that their followers will abandon them eventually. </p><p>As the Great God Om would say – it's a god-eat-god multiverse. The future is looking bleak for the Slavic powers. Athar rejoice.</p>Table: The Slavic Pantheon <table width="95%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" border="0"><tr><td>Name (rank) </td><td>AL </td><td>Portfolio </td><td>Home Plane </td><td>Domains </td></tr><tr><td><a href="#perun">Perun </a>(I) </td><td>CN </td><td>Thunder, strength, vengeance </td><td>Outlands </td><td>Chaos, Destruction, Retribution, Storm, Strength </td></tr><tr><td><a href="#bjelo">Bjelobog</a> (I) </td><td>NG </td><td>Happiness, success, giving </td><td>Elysium </td><td>Good, Joy, Renewal </td></tr><tr><td><a href="#czerno">Czernobog</a> (I) </td><td>NE </td><td>Sorrow, failure, selfishness </td><td>Gray Waste </td><td>Evil, Hatred, Suffering </td></tr><tr><td><a href="#dazh">Dazhbog</a> (I) </td><td>LG </td><td>Sun, family, kinship </td><td>Arcadia </td><td>Good, Family, Law, Protection, Sun </td></tr><tr><td><a href="#jarilo">Jarilo</a> (L) </td><td>CG </td><td>Plants, spring, rebirth </td><td>Arborea </td><td>Chaos, Good, Plant, Renewal </td></tr><tr><td><a href="#leso">Lesovik</a> (D) </td><td>CN </td><td>Woodlands, wild animals </td><td>Beastlands </td><td>Animal, Charm, Fey, Healing </td></tr><tr><td><a href="#marzh">Marzheena</a> (L) </td><td>LE </td><td>Death, the dying, arcane magic </td><td>Negative Energy </td><td>Death, Evil, Law, Magic </td></tr><tr><td><a href="#mokosh">Mokosha</a> (L) </td><td>CE </td><td>Crafts, wickedness, envy </td><td>Pandemonium </td><td>Artifice, Chaos, Evil, Trickery </td></tr><tr><td><a href="#stribog">Stribog</a> (L) </td><td>N </td><td>Winter, winds, rivers, travel </td><td>Outlands </td><td>Air, Cold, Travel, Water </td></tr><tr><td><a href="#svarog">Svarog</a> (I) </td><td>LN </td><td>Sky, earth, wisdom </td><td>Positive Energy </td><td>Air, Creation, Earth, Strength, Weather </td></tr><tr><td><a href="#svarozh">Svarozhich</a> (D) </td><td>CN </td><td>Fire, chaos, humor </td><td>Elemental Fire </td><td>Chaos, Fire, Life, Trickery </td></tr><tr><td><a href="#sveto">Svetovid</a> (I) </td><td>N </td><td>War, glory, omniscience </td><td>Outlands </td><td>Knowledge, Oracle, Time, War </td></tr></table><p><a name="#perun">PERUN</a> The Anvil, Rod, Zhiva, St. Elijah the Thundering Intermediate Power Symbol: Lightning bolt over a blue oval Plane/Layer/Realm: Outlands/-/Mountain of Thunder Alignment: Chaotic Neutral Portfolio: Thunder, strength, storm, endurance, vengeance Domains: Chaos, Destruction, Retribution, Storm, Strength Favored Weapon: Flail (heavy or light)  Known Proxies: None Dogma: Grow strong and procreate. Crush our foes. Defend our kin. When a thunderbolt crashes down from the heavens, remember that it's mighty Perun striking fear into the hearts of our enemies, and honor him with prayer.</p><p>As most element-related deities, Perun (pae-roon) is an old power, and currently the most prominent of the ruling trio of Slavic powers (which also includes Svarog and Svetovid). He retains some of his former strength due to the fact that his portfolio includes an endless thirst for vengeance. Ill-tempered and warlike, Perun is continually urging his fellow deities to strike back at the other religions, the &quot;belief-thieves&quot;, and restore the respect they deserve. Others are likely aware that directly challenging an established pantheon would, at this point, mean suicide. In the past millennium, Perun's alignment has strayed from chaotic and good to neutral with evil tendencies. Perun's worshipers over several Prime worlds still wage a guerilla war against the newly converted believers; human sacrifices occasionally take place. Outside the largest remaining temple dedicated to Perun, acolytes are charged with the task of keeping a bonfire burning day and night, regardless of whether or not sacrifices are being made; allowing the sacred fire to go out is punishable by death.Perun appears as a huge man with wild red brown hair, wielding a heavy flail. His realm in the Outlands, near the Dwarven Mountain, is continually guarded by an army of petitioners. He also maintains a domain on the Quasiplane of Lightning. </p><p><a name="#bjelo">BJELOBOG</a> The White Twin, the Shared Soul Intermediate Power Symbol: An open white hand, palm up Plane/Layer/Realm: Elysium/Amoria/Heart of White  Alignment: Neutral Good Portfolio: Happiness, success, giving Domains: Good, Joy, Renewal Favored Weapon: Longsword Known Proxies: None Dogma: Share what you have; give what is asked of you without hesitation, for it shall be repaid. Never lose hope, even when the dark falls upon you and yours. Live for new beginnings. Look ahead and smile, look above and pray. </p><p>Bjelobog (bee-yellow-bog) means literally &quot;white god&quot;. He is the brother of Czernobog, and the two powers share their dominion over the lives of mortals. Traditionally, Bjelobog rules them during the day, the spring and summer, the youth and middle age, leaving the darkness of their days and lives to his brother. Both brothers appear as wizened, wiry old men, although only Bjelobog's hair is fully white.Bjelobog encourages his worshipers to provide aid whenever and however they can, and to fully enjoy each moment of happiness, because dark days are always waiting. If the Slavic deities were more popular on the Planes, Sensates and Ring-Givers would be numerous among his followers. Bjelobog has a small realm on Eronia, Elysium. His worshipers are allowed to spend three Great Ring years (three full cycles) in this idyllic paradise, and one quarter in Czernobog's gloomy realm in the Gray Waste; this is so that they would appreciate what they have, and acknowledge the fact that neither happiness nor sorrow are truly endless.</p><p><a name="#czerno">CZERNOBOG</a> The Black Twin, the Taker Intermediate Power Symbol: A bloody black fist Plane/Layer/Realm: Gray Waste /Niflheim/Broken Pines Alignment: Neutral Evil Portfolio: Sorrow, failure, selfishness Domains: Evil, Hatred, Suffering Favored Weapon: Warhammer Known Proxies: None Dogma: There is no life, but what little you steal from others. Placate the Taker with sacrifice, and maybe he'll let you live another year. Abandon all hope of change or deliverance, and pray for undeserved mercy. </p><p>Czernobog (cher-no-bog) is Bjelobog's dark twin. The black god is gloomy, desperate, and generally negative about everything. He spends most of his time brooding over the fall of his pantheon and the foolishness of Perun's efforts to change what cannot be changed. Both Bjelobog and Czernobog appear as wizened, wiry old men, although Czernobog's beard and hair are not white but a dark shade of gray.Czernobog's worshipers pray to him out of fear. They know that they can expect his dark gaze to pass beyond them only if they make sacrifice, and the only sacrificial offerings Czernobog will accept are sentient beings. During winter, a single prisoner of war is brought under the hammer each night; anyone whose turn doesn't come until spring is set free by the grace of Bjelobog. Czernobog's realm is in Hades, on the layer of Niflheim. It is a dark wood filled with shadow fiends. Despite what some mortals may think, Czernobog is not actually the ruler of the dead – the only petitioners that end up in his realm are the truly desperate and dark souls. </p><p><a name="#dazh">DAZHBOG</a> The Giving God, Hors Intermediate Power Symbol: The sun's disc with two red eyes Plane/Layer/Realm: Elysium/Eronia/Eastern Bounty Alignment: Lawful Good Portfolio: Sun, family, kinship Domains: Good, Family, Law, Protection, Sun  Favored Weapon: Spear Known Proxies: None Dogma: Say your thanks for the light that brings life, the light that heals us, the light that keeps away the dark and its hunters. Honor Dazhbog's blessing with prayer, and beg him to always watch over you and yours, to keep away the evil folk and the beasts from the people. </p><p>Dazhbog (duzh-bog) is the most widely worshiped of the Slavic powers after Perun, and the best loved after Bjelobog. As the son of Svarog the Sky, he personifies the Sun. Dazhbog is thought of the direct protector of the Slavs, an interventionist deity that has sent down his avatars and proxies many times to help the people fight against diseases and natural disasters. In some incarnations, Dazhbog is also the protector of the home and hearth, while in some others he is respected as the patron of smiths and artisans. When the Slavic powers are ousted from a prime civilization, the missionaries often change the image of Dazhbog within people's hearts to a fallen celestial, a corrupted &quot;Star of the Morning&quot; that the true gods had cast away into the Nine Hells. This scenario was repeated several times now, although it is likely that the Slavic deity has nothing to do with the fall of a divine being into Baator, neither Ahriman nor Triel.Dazhbog usually chooses to as a tall, noble-looking youth with golden hair. Like many other Sun-related deities, he holds a domain on Eronia, the second layer of Elysium, near the realms of Ushas of the Hindu and Lathander of Faerûn. </p><p><a name="#jarilo">JARILO</a> The Green Man, Veles Lesser Power Symbol: A branch with a single green leaf Plane/Layer/Realm: Arborea/Arvandor/wanders Alignment: Chaotic Good Portfolio: Plants, spring, rebirth Domains: Chaos, Good, Plant, Renewal Favored Weapon: Quarterstaff Known Proxies: Vesna, CG quasi-power (female human) 16th-level Druid Dogma: Live of the land and for the land. Show love and devotion, and it will provide for you. Winter is not death, but merely sleep. With the sun's return come life and growth and joy. Praise the Green Man who brings them all.</p><p>Jarilo (Yar-ee-low) is a power of nature and vegetation, the lord of all green life. He is mostly revered among those few tribes that settle down and focus on agriculture, but even the nomadic majority pays him some respect. His domain does not include wild forests (since these belong to Lesovik), but all other plants, especially cultivated ones, grow only if Jarilo gives his blessings. In addition to this benevolent aspect, Jarilo also has a dark, vengeful side. He opposes all acts of disrespect and violence directed toward nature, occasionally sending animated plant creatures to punish the transgressors in his name. Jarilo opposes Old Man Winter (Stribog), and each spring these two do battle for control over their worshiper's lands. In truth, this &quot;battle&quot; is little more than a shift change; Jarilo and Stribog have little against each other on a personal basis. The priesthood of Jarilo consists mostly of adepts and druids, while clerics are virtually unknown. The priests are often female, and they conduct sacred rites on the last day of fall and the first day of spring. These ceremonies are usually taboo for non-worshipers.</p><p><a name="#leso">LESOVIK</a> The Fae Shepherd, Leshnyak, Leshey Demipower Symbol: A rune-carved branch Plane/Layer/Realm: Beastlands/Brux/wanders Alignment: Chaotic Neutral Portfolio: Woodlands, wild animals Domains: Animal, Charm, Fey, Healing Favored Weapon: Greatclub Known Proxies: Rasto, CN quasi-power (male spriggan) 15th-level Ranger Dogma: Be wary when you walk the forest, for it holds mysteries both small and large. It will confuse you, enchant you, and take you away. You will become a faerie's plaything, or a vodanoy's, or a rusalka's… Be wary. Or don't, what do I care… </p><p>Lesovik is an oddball among the Slavic powers. He is the patron of all wild animals and the master of the forests, but he seems not to care much for prayers and priests. He does care about offerings though, and no godly people will set on even a few hour's walk through the forests without paying homage to the Shepherd. Lesovik spends more time with the fey than with his fellow powers. He is entirely at ease only in the Seelie (or Unseelie) Court, where he is treated as nothing more than a visiting lord. He wants nothing to do with domesticated lands, let alone cities of stone. Lesovik doesn't have a permanent realm, but spends most of his time in Brux, Beastlands. His exact appearance changes daily, but he's usually seen as some sort of a humanoid with exaggerated features and wildly colored eyes, hair, and clothes, wearing an enormous wooden club. He is usually accompanied by several wild animals.</p><p><a name="#marzh">MARZHENA</a> The Guide, the Kindly Witch, Morana Lesser Power Symbol: A crooked finger-bone Plane/Layer/Realm: Negative Energy Plane/wanders Alignment: Lawful Evil Portfolio: Death, the dying, arcane magic Domains: Death, Evil, Law, Magic Favored Weapon: Quarterstaff Known Proxies: None; formerly Baba Yaga, NE quasi-power (female humanoid?) 24th-level Sorcerer Dogma: Do not fear death, fear a life poorly lived. When the Guide takes your hand, do not resist. She knows where you belong, and if your struggles anger her she might drop you, leave you between worlds, in the misty void where only restless, sorrowful spirits like yourself dwell. </p><p>Marzhena is the guide of the dead. She oversees the transportation of a mortal's souls to the proper realm where it will become a petitioner. She is also the hoarder of arcane darks, the witch that stole the mysteries from the gods and gave them to mortals. She is an ungodly spell-slinger's only option, and every Slavic would-be mage must eventually turn to her. The creation of the first undead shadow may or may not be Marzhena's doing, but it is certain that she has nothing to do with vampirism, which she abhors. In fact, dabbling in blood-magics was the reason why the Guide had abandoned her most promising servant and proxy, the infamous Baba Yaga.Mortal worshipers of Marzhena come in two types: one, the bleak folks who pray only for the timely, proper death of everyone, be it themselves, their loved ones, or their foes; and the others, the tyrannical, power-hungry types that practice the arcane arts in order to &quot;set things right&quot;.Marzhena dwells on the Negative Energy Plane, without a fixed, permanent realm. Her avatars are projected through time and space to the prime worlds where they take the form of a pale, white-robed woman. </p><p><a name="#mokosh">MOKOSHA</a> The Housewife Lesser Power Symbol: A broken spinning wheel Plane/Layer/Realm: Pandemonium/Agathion/Broken House Alignment: Chaotic Evil Portfolio: Crafts, wickedness, envy Domains: Artifice, Chaos, Evil, Trickery Favored Weapon: Dagger Known Proxies: None Dogma: Pray to the Housewife to turn her evil eye from you. Pray to her to spoil your rival's work. Pray to her to make you rival's man soft and her womb barren. Pray if you don't want another stillborn.</p><p>Mokosha is a woman's deity, a &quot;patron&quot; of small crafts, a vain and malicious power. In the middle of the night, she observes the Prime Material, inspecting the chores a woman has or has not finished by the end of the day, and at a whim either spoils her work, or helps her by spoiling another's work that night. Every action Mokosha takes is to someone's harm, no matter how small or insignificant it may seem (and it sometimes turns out that a spilled jug of milk has long-reaching consequences). She considers nothing else worth doing.No temples are built to Mokosha, but every house is her place of worship. No one likes her, but many pray to her. She is not respected, but she is feared, and that's all she asks for.Mokosha's realm in Agathion is a huge isolated cavern with a myriad of scrying pools, each one showing a single homestead at midnight. Mokosha wanders among the pools, always appearing as a ragged, black-robed crone, choosing where to interfere apparently at random.</p><p><a name="#stribog">STRIBOG</a> The Grandfather of Winds, Old Man Winter Lesser Power Symbol: A cone of wind Plane/Layer/Realm: Outlands/Hinterlands/wanders Alignment: Neutral Portfolio: Winter, winds, rivers, travel Domains: Air, Cold, Travel, Water Favored Weapon: Spear Known Proxies: Nightingale the Brigand, NE quasi-power (male human) 12th-level Rogue Dogma: When you are lost, the winds shall lead you. When you are drifting with no direction, wise Stribog will show you the way. Do not anger him, for his wrath is cold. Show proper respect, and the next winter might pull back before all your children starve and freeze. </p><p>Stribog (s-tree-bog) is the god of winter, of cold winds and waters. He watches over the travelers and the homeless. He is the one that decides whether the next winter season will be bearable or not. Not many pay homage to Stribog. Wanderers, sailors, exiles… when winter comes and food becomes scarce, most will turn to Dazhbog first, and if their prayers are not answered, try to pray to Stribog for mercy. Only when a large and dangerous migration takes place, as it sometimes does with the nomads, will Stribog see a significant increase in faith. Stribog rarely appears in humanoid form; he prefers the shape of a large cold whirlwind. He doesn't have a realm, but spends his time mostly in the Hinterlands, apparently interested in these mutable parts of the Lands. He sometimes dwells on Elemental Air or Quasielemental Ice for centuries, but doesn't have a permanent domain on these planes either.</p><p><a name="#svarog">SVAROG</a> The Maker, the Sky Intermediate Power Symbol: Three wavy horizontal lines Plane/Layer/Realm: Positive Energy Plane Alignment: Lawful Neutral Portfolio: Sky, earth, wisdom Domains: Air, Creation, Earth, Strength, Weather Favored Weapon: Greatclub Known Proxies: None Dogma: Honor your elders, and honor the elder of the gods ten times as much. He is the sky that made the earth, and all living things. He holds up the giving Sun so that it can shine down on us and bless us with health. He is wiser than anything, and can overrule any god's decision.</p><p>Another ancient deity, Svarog is typically associated with the concept of universal creation. He is the oldest of the Triglaw, the ruling trio of Slavic powers (Svarog, Svetovid, Perun; curiously reminiscent of the Hindu Trimurti consisting of Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva). He was once also a power of fire and the sun, but he turned over these aspects to his two sons, Dazhbog and Svarozhich. It is believed that Svarog no longer interferes actively in the events of the multiverse, nor answers his worshipers' prayers, but he still receives the respect that is due to a divine procreator, from mortals and immortals alike. Other powers, particularly his two sons and Bjelobog, often come to him for advice, and he occasionally answers their pleas. Svarog thoughts on the matter of the imminent dissolution of the pantheon remain a mystery for all.Svarog has a small realm on the Positive Energy Plane. There he meditates, attended by what few petitioners that he has and creatures known as &quot;spirits of the air&quot;.</p><p><a name="#svarozh">SVAROZHICH</a> Little Svarog, the Son of Flame, the Prankster Demipower Symbol: A hand holding a flame Plane/Layer/Realm: Elemental Fire/Gates of Power Alignment: Chaotic Good Portfolio: Fire, chaos, humor Domains: Chaos, Fire, Life, Trickery Favored Weapon: Dagger Known Proxies: Mara, CG quasi-power (female shad) 15th-level Bard Dogma: Rejoice in the blessed heat that Svarozhich brings into each home. Laugh, grow, live. Never let a man's spirit grow cold and die. Never restrain your passions, never bow to authority.</p><p>It is unknown whether Svarozhich is a true divine entity or merely a chaotic aspect of Svarog, but since most followers respect him almost as much as the other powers, we will assume he is an independent deity. This &quot;Little Svarog&quot; is the prankster of the Slavic pantheon, a vibrant being that embodies the essence of life. He is the one that kindles the flames inside every living being's soul, and when he looks the other way and the cold creeps into a berk's bones, there is little time left for living. Svarozhich enjoys irritating and outwitting other powers of the pantheon, particularly Stribog. The god of winter has attempted to destroy him many times, but Svarozhich is usually under his father's protection. Svarozhich is usually seen in the form of young red-haired boy, wearing a golden helmet with wings.No temples are built to Svarozhich; he is worshiped either in sacred places dedicated to Svarog, or simply over a small bonfire. Sacrifices devoted to Svarozhich are never living beings; usually simple figurines made out of dry wood and straw are used.</p><p><a name="#sveto">SVETOVID</a> Svantovid, Yarovit, the All-Seeing One Intermediate Power Symbol: A four-faced head Plane/Layer/Realm: Outlands Alignment: Neutral Portfolio: War, glory, omniscience Domains: Knowledge, Oracle, Time, War Favored Weapon: Longbow Known Proxies: Porentius, NG quasi-power (male human) 6th-level Fighter / 12th-level Cleric Dogma: There is no victory without knowledge. Whether you seek the glory of the battlefield or the wisdom of the ages, you must have the favor of the All-Seeing to obtain this goal. He knows all that once was and all that will be. He watches over his people and guides them to victory when they deserve it. Obey his priests, for they are blessed with the holy sight, and know the will of the gods. </p><p>Worshiped by the most civilized Slavic tribes, Svetovid (s-wet-oh-weed) is a power of both warfare and wisdom. He watches over soldiers who are both cunning and brave, and over rulers who are both mighty and resourceful. He knows both the past and the future, but reputedly has problems focusing on the present moment – this can also be said of his priests, who are often absent-minded seers. The primary interest of Svetovid (literally &quot;holy sight&quot;) seems to be the well-being of his people; he guides them with prophetic advice and aids them in battle. However, his wisdom is as hard to understand as his omens, and his acts can sometimes seem malicious even though the clergy claims that the fate of the people in the distant future is Svetovid's ultimate goal. Svetovid usually appears as a human with four heads, each facing a different direction. Temples dedicated to him are always made of wood, typically birch. Ceremonies are performed by a single priest, who is required to hold his breath during the whole act, in order to avoid clouding his deity's prophetic eye. Svetovid's only known proxy, Porentius, is a foreigner to the Slavs, a convert from another religion (possibly Roman). </p></p>   </div>

         <p>Damn, I get a 5.0 for <span style="font-style:italic">this </span>one?! I did pinch some stuff off the Tiefling's Exultation site, you know...</p>

<p>Don't know about the "slavic power plane"... I guess it would be an interesting alternate history idea, to see what might have happened had the slavs retained their native religion and eventually came into power, like the japanese did <img src="http://planewalker.com/sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/wink.png" title="Eye-wink" alt="Eye-wink" class="smiley-content"/> <br />
I know of some alt-history SF books that deal with the issue, for example "Jeka" ("Echo"), a short story by a guy called Zoran Jakši&#263;, but I'm pretty sure there's no English translation. Which is a damn shame, IMHO.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">
