        <div class="dice_rolls">
</div> <p>I've been looking over the article submission system here and have at this point come to the conclusion that it frankly isn't working at all. This is something that we need to have worked out if this site is to stay as vital and lively as it has in the past. We need articles and new content to survive. So please, take a moment to read over this and comment - <span style="font-weight:bold">this post is about some very major changes I had in mind for the site in the near future.</span></p>

<p>While the code does function and all, it's just not being used. Which means one of two things is happening - either everyone on the site is dry-as-bone creatively speaking (I *seriously* doubt that!). Or the system as it stands just isn't convenient, useful, or obvious enough in it's use.</p>

<p>So.</p>

<p>I would like to hear some feedback on a new approach to the idea. If you have another solution, please suggest it. But in the absence of feedback or other ideas, here's what I had in mind:</p>

<p>1) Closing out existing submissions<br />
2) Moving all articles to blog ownership of their respective authors<br />
3) Making an effort from here on out to simply promote to the front page good blog posts or forum posts<br />
4) Eventually closing down the sub-section based menus that we have in favor of merged, tagged, and searchable content</p>

<p>What this means for the end user:</p>

<p>1) No more editorial overview of your work. So you will be required to mind your own spelling and grammar if you want the work on the front page</p>

<p>2) No more sub sections in the menus. Yes, this means no more 'Rrakkma', 'Kyto's Hooks', or 'Creature Codex' - though the content will still be in our system and accessible via other means. You'll be finding content via search, related tags, or other menu structures to get you to what you want</p>

<p>I don't think I can emphasize quite enough how very very important it is that I get feedback on this decision from you guys. I need to know what you think and how you go about using the site. So please, sound off in the comments!</p>       </div>

         <p><p>Sounds handy. Seems to me like we don't really need individual subsections and article submissions - with good tags and searchability, everything creatively useful can go in forum and blog posts (which is what everyone is using anyway). Slightly more work for the seeker of truth, perhaps, but once we get used to how it works it should be fine.</p></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><p>@Azure - would it help if you could still cross reference in our search engine 'githzerai' and 'npc' and still get to your rrakkma stuff, or likewise cross referencing sigil and npc and golden lord to get to the golden lords? (Right now even the current material is just the results of a taxonomy search, so our search system could definately get at the data for you.)</p><p>My idea here is that the material isn't going to vanish or even ideally be more than a click away from the top - I'm just looking at moving away from the slightly gimmicky subsections. The concept of subsites doesn't seem to really be doing us much good overall from what I'm seeing on the site statistics. Rrakkma got a grand total over all of 1681 views since January 1st this year. Keeping in mind we average around 450 unique visitors a day, that should give an idea how low the percentage of visits really is for that section.</p><p>I guess really I'm trying to narrow in on what your real needs are - I'm thinking the sub site's themselves are less the issue than the easy findability of what you're looking for? I'd like to make sure you can still get at what you need to get at in terms of menu structure. My original idea was to rely on search, related terms in our article displays, and a general article-by-type submenu, such as "NPCs | Locations | Items | Culture | Spells/Psionic Powers", with perhaps a side bar showing locations as well to allow you to get at things from that angle too. Does that make a little more sense?</p></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

          I do think a solid        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><p>I do think a solid reorganization of the whole site will be useful. Plus, I see more "creativity" style articles in then blogs these days than I do in the articles. I think there could be a mistaken&nbsp;impression is that an article submission is some kind of formal affair, as if you're submitting to an actual academic journal or somesuch. On the other hand, I, at least, have submitted a few articles in my time that were just written on-the-spot. But I agree with Bob that proper use of tags and search engines could really help make the site look more active again.</p><p>How will articles become "front page worthy?" Will there be a sort of voting system? Will it be by committee/by webmaster's choice? Some other method? A combination of the two?</p><p>I think the best way to revitalize this site is place more emphasis on the forums as Planewalker's community. Forums are extremely convenient, easy to have discussions on, and are usually the first place people go to look for interaction. A lot of people probably bypass the front page completely most of the time and go straight to the forums, so it's probably best to emphasize the forums more. People that come to this site are most likely coming to meet and interact with other Planescape fans, not simply read articles.</p><p>I think the blogs have good intentions but I ultimately believe they segregate Planewalker's active community. I have seen a few good blog entries&nbsp;that would make even better forum topics because they'd have more visibility and would then spur more discussion.&nbsp;As it is, though,&nbsp;blogs are not clearly visible or accessible, and they spread the community too thin. Some people don't use the blogs at all, others use them almost exclusively. I think if the blogs and the forums were combined, this place would suddenly look a lot more active.</p><p>Furthermore, I think if people want to ramble on about the movie they saw last week or how their date was with this new girl, there are plenty of blogging services&nbsp;for that. If they want to write their thoughts on something Planescape- or planar-related, then I think it's much, MUCH better off as a forum topic.&nbsp; Just looking at the "New Blogs" list at the time I made this post, I have to wonder why fourof the five are only blog entries and not forum topics. Specifically, I'm looking at all of them except "He could have made her beautiful." This is an information site, but my impression is that it's also meant to be a community where Planescape fans can get together and discuss Planescape.&nbsp;As I said, the blogs spread that community way too thin.</p><p>If, as you suggest above, there's a way to "promote" good forum posts, then I suggest you abolish the blog system completely. Put all articles and planar-related blog entries under the domain of the forums. Someone found a link to an article that seems useful for Planescape fans? Post it in the forums. Someone has a youtube video that reminds them of Planescape? Post it in the forums. Someone wants to talk about the weather? Heartily recommend they head over to Wordpress or Blogspot or Livejournal and get a personal blog.</p><p>I also believe that the article system, while a good part of Planewalker in the older days, would also be better served if it were just part of the forums. Plus, now that many forum technologies offer the ability to tag posts, it can make the forums serve as the article repository and still keep things easily searchable.</p><p>Revamp the forums. Most of these section forums haven't been touched months.&nbsp;A few&nbsp;have been collecting dust for over a year and it looks kind of bad to see so many inactive forums. Move all of the inactive forums to an archive -- even better, does the forum software support child forums? Stuff them in a parent board so the content still exists, but you don't have five or six long-dormant forums all in a row.</p><p>Make the purpose of each board clearer. Is it possible to put a bit of text after each board to explain the board's function, ala phpBB3 and others? I know the site used to have something like this, but it seems to have disappeared. Anyway, after my years-long hiatus, I've been back for almost a year now and I'm still not certain what the difference between RPG Discussion, Planar Ventures, and Hall of Records are supposed to be, and as best I can guess, we wouldn't lose much (and we might look more active!) if we merged all three into one board.&nbsp; This will be a BIG help if the site focuses more on the forums.</p><p>&lt;a href="http://www.fraternityofshadows.com/forum"&gt;The Fraternity of Shadows&lt;/a&gt;, a popular and very active Ravenloft board that I frequent, has the following layout for forums, which seems to be a familiar structure for most gaming-related sites, both tabletop and video game.</p><p>- The Announcements Board for all important site manager announcements- The Bug Board for reporting issues (Actually at FoS, these first two are the same board but two separate boards work)- A general "On Topic" board for all discussion, articles, etc., related to the site's setting or theme (Any and all Planescape discussion, in this case)- An "on topic" "creative endeavors" board for fiction, art, etc. This board is strictly for literary, artistic, and similar pursuits. If you're posting about a site, a cutter, a faction, etc., you go to the general Planescape board. If you're writing a piece of fiction or drawing a picture, it goes in this creativity board- A "general gaming" board for all non-Planescape gaming. General 3.x/4e, Pathfinder, White Wolf, whatever other gaming topics would go here.- An "off topic" forum for discussion about almost anything. A lot of sites I've seen limit what you can actually talk about here (i.e., no politics or religion) and I think this is a good idea - especially in a place like this where we have some pretty peaceful philosophical discussions beyond the scope of our world. We don't need real-world politics here and if people want to discuss them, they can go to a political site- The requisite gaming boards for PbP gaming. As a side note, I think the Sensorium board could probably fit in the "on topic fiction" board.- Some sites (like FoS) have a forum dedicated to site projects and community projects. A site project would be the 4e Planescape Setting, while a community project would be if someone decided to create, say, <em>Arborea: The Campaign Setting </em>or <em>Professor Thomas Carter's Notes on the Lower Planes </em>or <em>Angels, Aasimon, and Aasimar, a Book on Celestials </em>or whatnot. I think these kinds of boards would be useful to Planewalker.</p><p>The short version is that I think the best way to make this site really go is to put the forums at the center of attention and derive the front page articles from the forums and from major site announcements and features.&nbsp;I think the blogs should go completely, and I think the article system, while useful in the past, is better served by being part of the forums. I think the forums should be revamped, clearly labelled and made more user-friendly, and I think this will really make&nbsp;a big difference in the site's apparent and real activity.</p></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><p>A few questions/thoughts:</p><p>1.) What do you plan to use to determine what posts and articles are "front-page-worthy?" Will it be site staff, popular vote, some combination of the two?</p><p>2.) Assuming site staff has a hand in front-page-worthiness, will there be somewhere that we can clearly see who the kingmakers are? I really don't know who besides Clueless is actually "staff" on this site anymore, and if it's just you, Clueless, delegate some of that to others <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/wink.png" title="Eye-wink" alt="Eye-wink" class="smiley-content"/> There are plenty of planars that I'm sure would be quite willing to help out.</p><p>3.) I think a list of popular tags like what you proposed in response to Azure would be useful regardless of whether the site goes forum-centric or article-centric. Makes it easy to quickly see where the articles are and what tags you should use if you want your article seen in the search engine.</p></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><p>Right now the staff is me and Loki - Loki is sweet for putting up with me as my partner in crime. <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/wink.png" title="Eye-wink" alt="Eye-wink" class="smiley-content"/> He's focused solidly on a lot of interviewy stuff, with the occasional dip into pushing out NPCs or locations articles. I'm dev and a lot of day to day front page promotion and project management.</p><p>Ideally what I would like to see for a front page article is in one of two flavours:</p><p>1) A news scoop or blurb, announcements and the like. Short, sweet, with all the links needed. Ideally with an image or logo of the relevant party as well so folks know what it's about.</p><p>2) Longer articles, such as stories, npc or location writeups, cultural pieces, etc.</p><p>In both cases they need to be spelling and grammar checked. Ideally they'd come with an illustrative image. We're really heavy on text on the site here and I think that impacts our readability. But having something *to* read is more important.</p><p>The biggest problem I see with making something front-page based on site votes is timing. At the moment, by the time we got enough votes to know if something should go on the front, it's essentially out of date for the front page and/or all the target audience has seen and voted on it. I'm not sure if that gets us much of anywhere - at least at the size and use patterns we have right now. (A year from now when our traffic has gone through the roof... that will probably be very different. ;)&nbsp;&nbsp; )</p><p>Though - if I've missed something of interest - I'd love to have it brought to my attention... that might be a better way to do it for now - as a straight up nomimation rather than with voting.</p></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><p>Hmm, I see your point re: problems with voting. Unfortunately, nothing comes to mind as an alternative other than expanding forum management staff to some people with the ability to promote posts. Obviously not every forum post&nbsp;can go on the front page and the ones that merit the attention should probably go up front as soon as possible after it's posted. So if there's no separate article section, I think it will have to be a manual promotion process.</p></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><p>Simplification is key when it comes to any sort of website. Of course, there is always the danger of oversimplifying, especially when it comes to information-loaded websites such as this.</p><p>Center of All is most certainly on to something. Keeping new content in the forums does tend to spur discussion and provides an opportunity for refinement. The design offered (along with quick little descriptions under the category links) would certainly be easier to navigate and perhaps a little less intimidating to the typical user (and even perhaps some atypical users). Promoting the best topics would also encourage more activity and perhaps provide inspiration.</p><p>An alternative, if such a thing can't be programmed into the site itself, are monthly "Admin's Choice" front-page articles with lists of links of topics that the admins found particularly interesting and/or informative, plus a brief summary of the contents of those topics. There could also be "Overlooked Topics" or "Development Encouraged" articles for the underdogs.</p><p>These could be categories on the front page instead--and the topics themselves could be the articles.</p><p>An effective way to organize all the "official" material would be to put it in a Wiki sort of design. I find that, in most cases, Wikis make it ridiculously easy to look up information--not to mention they are often quite addicting and I find myself learning more than I initially intended. However, you won't be winning any awards for uniqueness.</p></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><p>The more I think about it, the more the forums seem the way to go if there is a way to tag one's posts or the forum topics are arranged in a way that was similar to the article sections.I like the blogs only in that I thought they were a good place for the random things that might be of interest to PS fans, or as inspiration. There are little things I like to post that inspire me, but would simply clutter the forums. I suppose if we had a forum specifically for inspirations that would be better.I do think if all creative content is easily searchable via tags/topics then putting it all in one place would increase visibility/comments.</p></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

          I think we have some really        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><p>I think we have some really great ideas here, and would like to add a few notes drawn from my professional experience with the web.</p><p>1) I think forums need to be made more central as that is where the maority of our activity goes on. That said I do not think going over to nothing but is a good idea. There are many people who do not use forums and seem to have a block against it. I do not want to users lost because we have not met them on a common ground. This is supposed to be for all of us Planescape junkies after all.</p><p>2) Subheadings need to be cleaned up, but I think they should stay. Again this comes back to having site users with varying levels of digital ability. There are many who use those as a quick fix during games for real time info. While most of us on the forums have the ability to easily use a tag based folksonomie there are others who would feel lost and miss out on finding the Planescapey goodness they seek. While I love seeing all the younger gamers embrace my favorite setting please recall that a significant number of PS players and DMs are in their 40's like I am. Many in that age range lack skills most of you grew up with.</p><p>3) I would like to enable social platforms so that things can be easily shared on Facebook, delicious, twitter, etc. Of course that's what I do for a living so I'll be talking wth Clueless about it when we have a better idea of the shape of things to come. Anyone with input on this let me know here or hit me on twitter ( <a href="http://www.twitter.com/planejammer" target="_blank">@planejammer</a> ).</p><p>4) Search and discovery of info need to be rebooted. I spent a large chunk of time looking for nemui's 3.5 reboot of the quasi-elemental planes recently without coming up with them.</p><p>5) A static page with the download links for our "products" (PSCS, etc.) Get them out there in the most efficient way possible.</p><p>I'm in the midst of an ugly set of deadlines so I'll stop here for now. I'll be back with more grist for the fiend mill soon. In the meantime keep in mind that I may not post frequently but I am her to serve the Planewalker community. Never be afraid to reach out with any questions whatsoever. You might have a 24-48 hour response time depending on my work schedule but you will get an answer.([REDACTED])</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

There are little things I like to post that inspire me, but would simply clutter the forums. I suppose if we had a forum specifically for inspirations that would be better.</div></p><p>I don't see any reason why this kind of thing can't go in a "PS General" forum. It keeps the forums active and while it may not be much, it's very relevant to the site and will probably be less of a clutter than it sounds. I think a separate board would just make more confusion on where a particular post belongs. Like I mentioned in my original post on the topic, I don't see any reason why the blog entries you had up at the time can't be in a general PS forum.</p><p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&quot;Loki&quot;</em> wrote:</div>1) I think forums need to be made more central as that is where the maority of our activity goes on. That said I do not think going over to nothing but is a good idea. There are many people who do not use forums and seem to have a block against it. I do not want to users lost because we have not met them on a common ground. This is supposed to be for all of us Planescape junkies after all.</div></p><p>I'm very curious to know more about this, mainly because I've never heard of anything like this before. I can understand people being shy or reluctant to sign up and jump headfirst into the community, but I don't understand the "block" you're talking about. It seems to me that forums are the lifeblood of any active online community, especially interest-specific communities, and if someone has a "block" against using -- or even strictly searching and reading -- forums, it makes me wonder why they seek out interest communities to begin with.</p><p>I know a lot of people come solely to look up certain bits of information and have no interest in participating in the community (and I find that forum searches often prove adequate for many people in finding what they want without participating). However, I find it <em>extremely</em> hard to believe that we'd lose all that much traffic simply because we've become a forum-centric site. I find the converse more palpable: We'd lose more traffic because we don't have a clear and centralized community system.</p></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><p>@Center of All Sory for the lack of clarity, mea culpa. I did not mean block as in Spam block or other such, I meant "a mental block or bias against." I know a number of Planescape gamers that do not use forums, hell I did not use forums for much prior to my involvement as a manager here and that was mostly because I view community management as part of the gig.</p><p>If we are creating a resource we need to make it as user friendly to people at varying tech levels as possible. That was all I was attempting to get across. Think of like the legally required handicapped access that physical buildings must adhere to. In our case it is not mandated, but out of obligation to our userbase should be seriously considered.</p><p>I'm also not decrying the need for an intuitive and centralized forum system. I do think it is incorrect to believe the two to be mutually exclusive.</p><p>@Clueless will check on the faceted search when I have a moment. Up to my eyeballs just now.Any input from Marable on this, btw?</p><p>Lets keep the dialogue going, its the best way to hammer out a consensus approach.</p></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

He's not on the site very much at all anymore.</p><p>Re: moving to forum centric - I think what we're talking about here isn't stripping out the whole page until all that's left is forums. We're talking about using the forums as the main seeding ground for new posts and articles, and restructuring the front page's menus and search to be cleaner and simpler. The front page will be where it always has been, only with articles that saw their birth on the forums instead of the harder-to-find/use story interface. Drupal sees no difference between the two on the backend, so it's relatively easy to set up. Does that help make things a little clearer and ease the worry re: users who hate going on forums to read stuff? They'll still be reading it from the front page none-the-wiser.</p></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

I could see this getting abused easily, what with some people "suggesting" every thread posted, or every thread by a particular person, or so on. On the other hand, I think most mods will be able to filter out that kind of noise. It's pretty easy to tell who is spamming the button and also pretty easy to ignore them -- or perhaps revoke their suggestion privileges.</p></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

          Hi, I mostly lurk at        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><p>Hi, I mostly lurk at Planewalker, but I'm a big fan of your work and am really pleased that you got an ENNie for all the hard work you have put in over the years.</p><p>I've not written any articles for Planewalker (at least I have not written any...yet) and I think I have a very low post count on the forums, but maybe my less requent use can help me to give you a newbie point of view of how your homepage and website look to me.</p><p>When I look at your homepage I see a lot of sections that I just don't understand. I'm not saying you are any worse than any other D&amp;D fansite, because clearly you are an award winning site. If I dig around I find great content, but I just don't "get" what all of these sections are supposed to be. I think they have a meaning for your regular users (so it would be a shame for you to dump these sections if the regular users love the names) but a bit of a restructure could help newbies. At the moment I find it a lot easier to find things with Google toolbar than your own website. That isn't going to be good news for a casual visitor.</p><p>The forum idea is a fairly good one, but the non-forum parts of Planewalker are the things that change this place from "some bloke with a Planescape forum" into "THE Planescape website". Birthright.net have done the forum-only thing and it really buries their netbooks. And there are so many "blokes with forums" in the world, that I'm not sure how a casual visitor to Birthnet.com is going to realise they are any better than "a bloke with a Birthright forum" (and dig down to the great stuff they have over there). I think that blogs are probably more idea for things like campaign journals than forums, but if they can also be used to help your trusted staff to post news directly onto your homepage that is going to make it more dynamic. I don't really use blogs myself, but if some people use them for specific things like that, maybe they have a place next to the forums.</p><p>One thing that I think would be very useful (for the non-forum stuff) would be a big friendly "how to find things on Planewalker.com" link. I would want to see that link on the homepage (and maybe a much smaller link in your footer) and would want it to take me to a page that explains the difference between "Kyto's Hooks" and "Snails Outfitters". If you put the newbie help off of the front page, you can go into a lot more detail about how to find stuff (without getting in the way of the stuff the regulars want to be reading). You could even describe how to find things by content type, so that I could look up something like "pregen characters" and then be told where I should surf off too. And please...if you have a newbie page...please don't fill it up with all that Planescape speak.&nbsp; That might look good in a player handout, but it is confusing to newbies (and probably also to people that have English as a second language) and it is also a bit pointless when stuff is meant to be out of character content for a GM.</p><p>I'm not sure if you had your sights set on revamping the Planewalker Encyclopedia, but it is one of the main reasons why I visit your website. I've just checked it in Firefox and I see an uber long list of words (and the letters of the alphabet) at the top of every article (I think this may be invisible content in IE). If you could make this section work a little bit more like Forgotten Realms Wiki, The Great Library of Greyhawk or even Dragonlance Lexicon I would be happy beyond belief. Those things do the same thing as your encyclopedia, but look a lot prettier and have a lot more internal hyperlinks.</p><p>My main technical problem with the encyclopdia is that you have a weird way of doing your links. Instead of linking directly to other articles, you have this strange "freelinking" URL. Sometimes when I click on a link I get sent to a search page instead of another article (and when you have got used to the other encyclopedia's I've mentioned, as well as the Hypertext d20 SRD that sort of unexpected redirection feels a bit disjointed). You have some great artwork in Artist's Alley and I wonder if you could find some sort of way to put that art into appropriate Encyclopedia articles. Dragonlance Lexicon did this (and even ran an "art request thread" in the Dragonlance Forums) and they went from a text only encyclopedia to a beautifully illustrated one. The two wiki's I mentioned have always had the ability to have art in them. I think that if you could recycle your existing art it would really beautify a part of the website that is the newbie's encyclopedia of Planescape. And if you don't have art for specific articles, then a thread requesting artwork to order can help your amateur artists to help revamp your website.</p><p>Anyway, I've had years of interspaced pleasure from your website, so I hope you take this as constructive criticism rather than moaning. I'll carry on sneaking around the back way even if I have problems with the front page.</p><p>Good luck with your revamp and thanks to all of the people you have working to upload stuff here.</p></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>Loki De Carabas</em> wrote:</div></p><p>Big Mac! Great to see you on our forums, brother! Hope England is treating you well. Great input as always!</p><p>@Clueless Bg Mac is one of our best and most prolific Spelljammer developers over the Official SJ Site, always worth listening when he chimes in.</div></p><p>Thanks for the welcome, but just to correct your statement to Clueless, I've not got a massive amount of content on BtM. I've got one article actually up and a few things tied up in the stalled SJ netmag (Into the Void). I have more content, but it is all partially developed stuff that has not been put online yet.</p><p>My relevance (from a Planewalker point of view) is probably down to two facts: I'm the founder of the Spellljammer Wiki (which is hoping to eventally do for Spelljammer, what Planewalker's Encyclopedia is doing for Planescape) and I'm one of the three moderators on the Spelljammer forum at The Piazza (which is the world's most active Spelljammer forum). I'm also part of the effort (also via The Piazza) to restart the 3e SJCS project and try to catch up a bit with what faster people have done over here.</p><p>From a Planewalker point of view the SJCS is the Material Plane, and any good fanon that gets developed by the SJ community is somthing that you could have a "how to use X in Planescape" article about over here. People like Loki (who have a foot in both camps) would be good for writing this sort of thing (if you can't get the original author to revisit their work from a PS point of view). The SJ Wiki is primarily going to be aimed at authors of SJ fanon, as it is a canon encyclopedia (this is why I'm trying to get accurate citations into every article - and why I would also find citations useful over here). But when it gets going the SJ Wiki might also be useful to Planescape authors working on crossover fanon (or even Planescape GMs who want to raid SJ for ideas).</p><p>I'm also hoping to see the Planejammer concept (which I believe that Loki might have started) moved forward and would be keen to see a joint BtM/Planewalker netbook that follows on the heels of the PW's PSCS and BtM's SJCS and creates a Planejammer Campaign Sourcebook (or dare I say it - a full blown Planejammer Campaign Setting) that shows GMs how to get D&amp;D's two transitive settings to work in tandem. If I can do anything that is of any significant use to Planescape GMs - I would guess that work on Planejammer would be my niche.</p><p>I'm not sure where this sort of stuff could go onto the Planewalker website (as I said there are not any newbie friendly instructions...yet) but as a crossover fan, I would also enjoy seeing other material on Planewalker for connecting Planewalker to <strong>every</strong> published D&amp;D campaing setting. I think that isn't going to be what most Planescape fans are into, so wouldn't suggest sticking this sort of thing on the front page, but there are a few "official" sites out there and it would be cool beyond belief if they could work together to support these sorts of concepts. Many of these settings are long out of print and it is only us fans that keep their vision alive. I would like to see all of the major fansites (not just Planewalker) refer visitors to each other. Other websites have pages that exchange links. That is OK, but I'd rather see something that exchanges more than just a link. It would be nice if at some point in the future there could be a page that describes setting X, how it can be made to work with Planescape, a bibliography of official products (or a link to a page elsewhere that already does this), a link to a netbook (or if that doesn't exist a link to a page that has a bunch of links to relievant articles). And with things like RSS feeds out there, I would like to see these sort of pages be dynamic pages that allow a PS fan to see if the other fansites have any articles of interest up. (For example, I could browse over to a Dragonlance page that explains how Planewalkers might visit Adlatum and has a link to download the Adlatum Campaign Setting from Dragonlance Nexus.)</p><p>I realise that sort of thing (especially the community/community support side) is going to take time to put into place, but someone has got to start the ball rolling and if you are doing a revamp anyway, it could be you. You say that one of your aims is to have more Planscape content, but I think that a bit of cross community work could enable you to "convert" every bit of top quality content that is on another leading D&amp;D website. That might send a few random visitors over to another D&amp;D website, but I think it could also potentially expand a PS GMs options by a tenfold. I'm sure there are already PS GMs doing this, but I wouldn't know where to look to see their notes or ask their advice.</p></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><p>@zimrazim Could you throw us some specifics? No offense taken, but this is exactly the type of input we need to build the best site possible.</p><p>@SwordOfSpirit That is exactly why I brought up retaining them earlier in the thread. Clueless is the web dabus so its much more in her court than my own, but I agree with your comments pretty much across the board.&nbsp;</p><p>@BigMac Yeah, Planejmmer was the term coined in our campaign back in&nbsp; the early '9os and I don't know of anyone using the term prior to that.Sorry to have misrepresented you there, I thought we had more of your stuff up on Beyond the Moons, something we will have to recitfy</p><p>As you know I've always thought that more collaboration between Planewalker and BTM would be great for all concerned, after al the Spejammer cosmology is presented as the Planescape view of the Prime. Anyway I'll do what I can to get the cross campaign setting stuff up a online if the consensus ends up beig to do it, I've wanted to see that happen for awhile ut havent had the time to spearhead due to real life issues.</p><p>@Clueless Looking forward to hearing your thoughts on the above input.</p><p>Everyone else: please keep leaving input, especially if you are a&nbsp; new visitor or lurker. We can't fix problems and streamline tings properly if we don't know where the snags are. You help is hugely apprecited by both of us and by the Planescape community. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><p>Here is a snippit of something I sent to the web dabus, but perhaps here is the better place, add to the discussion and all that. This is from the perspective of a fledgling DM, who wanted to take his players back, most of which are ten years younger than me, to my setting, the setting I started out in as a player;&nbsp; Sigil.&nbsp; Been a player for a while, but seeking a 3.5 adaptation of Planescape is what brought me here, and I'll admit, I barely managed, at first.&nbsp; Its not the most flattering thing, but its honest.&nbsp; I may be quiet, and keep to myself, mostly, but I love what you all have here, and I want to see it continue to thrive.</p><p>Navigation is painful.&nbsp; But I'm not actually sure if its the navigation thats painful, or just the fact that I'm not sure what to be looking for.&nbsp; I still have very little idea what most of the sections on the site mean.&nbsp; Beyond that, the site itself is functional, if not somewhat slow to respond. * 3.x official ...&nbsp;&nbsp; * Sourcebooks&nbsp;&nbsp; * Modules&nbsp;&nbsp; * Monster Addendum&nbsp;&nbsp; * Spells</p><p>Same structure for 4x, when that day comes.</p><p>&nbsp;To my mind, its vitally important that Planescape Setting "core" remain intact, and easy to access. Which, somewhat exists now.&nbsp; But you have to actually be here for a while to understand that.&nbsp; I know when I first arrived, I didn't quite know the difference between the PSCS and PS3E sections, and still have no idea what Planar Portals really is. <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/smile.png" title="Smiling" alt="Smiling" class="smiley-content"/> If Planewalker ends up going pure content submission/drupal type, I'd be worried that the official material would be lost -- and both are needed.&nbsp; Searchable content is amazing.&nbsp; I just.. have problems with the engine.&nbsp; I'm not exactly sure why, I haven't looked at it too closely, I'll admit -- but the results I get, are never the results I expect.&nbsp; It sounds like I'm not alone in that sentiment. I don't know if anyone familar with the d20srd site, but if so, take a look.. the entire system reference document, laid out in html and easily searchable. A DMs best friend, if I ever saw one.&nbsp; Applying the same concept to Planewalker would make it infinitely more usable as a source.&nbsp; Perhaps not practical, and surely not really an option for most of the player-generated content, but for the "core"...? More than anything, a guide for new players, or new DMs, explaining how to use the resources that exist, is needed.&nbsp; A <span>clueless</span> without a guide, stays that way.At first glance, I thought that the site was abandoned, when the New Articles section shows precious little activity, and an article going back 4+ years.&nbsp; Thought it was Mimir all over again.&nbsp; Glad to see that wasn't the case <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/smile.png" title="Smiling" alt="Smiling" class="smiley-content"/></p><p>&nbsp;</p></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

          What if Rrakkma had its own        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><p>What if Rrakkma had its own special board on the forums like it does now instead of being a site category? It's my opinion that active sections should be allowed to remain active, while the others should be culled and archived.</p><p>If it is a board with select articles promoted to front page status, then it gives easier access to ALL Rrakkma-related material instead of just what's been "published" to the section. I think this is important -- just because something's not front page doesn't mean it's not worth reading or won't be useful to someone. A visitor that wants to read the featured articles can still do that, but there's also the option to rummage through everything people are saying about Rrakkma.</p><p>Personally, (and somewhat in keeping with Loki's themes of accessibility) I believe the categories immediately visible on the front page should stay much more general than Rrakkma. Flavored names are fine, but I think we should stick with broader topics like (but not limited to) NPCs, monsters, adventure hooks, locations, and fiction rather than more specific topics like Rrakkma. Rrakkma will still be around, but as Clueless said, that section receives only a tiny portion of Planewalker's traffic. I think it's safe to say that the majority of people that come to Planewalker specifically to look at Rrakkma content already know it's there and already use it frequently. To me, that does not merit a front page section listing, but since it's still quite active, I think it deserves its own board. Of course, that is not my decision to make <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/wink.png" title="Eye-wink" alt="Eye-wink" class="smiley-content"/></p><p>Clueless did mention that forums and articles are virtually the same thing in Drupal's back-end (that sounds really dirty all of a sudden) so the matter may be academic.</p><p>Regarding the promoting of "unfinished" topics to the front page, I have a couple of ideas for that:</p><p>1.) Allow a poster to disable voting&nbsp;</p><p>2.) Encourage the use of a [DRAFT] tag to let people know this isn't something that should be promoted.</p><p>3.) Incorporate the above DRAFT tag into the tag code to prevent all posts with DRAFT from ever making it to the front page.</p><p>4.) Just put the onus on the poster to produce the best product he or she can when posting.</p><p>I think asking for absolute perfection is a bit much. We're all volunteers and a majority of us are amateurs, so I think we should cut each other (and ourselves) a lot of slack on how much editing has to go into a front page article. My perspective is if a post is readable and mostly error-free, it passes the first test for front-page featurehood. Once it passes that test, it should get voted on based on its content.</p><p>For example, I'm too lazy to edit myself most of the time. As a result, I have posted (and had published) a few of articles that have never been edited. You can probably tell which of my articles have been really thought out and which ones were just kinda thrown together on a whim. I don't have many articles, but every one of them I've written has gone up front at some point.</p><p>So I think we should be content to settle for "good enough" as a site standard. If the writer demonstrates at least a passable understanding of English grammar and spelling, then I think we should look past all but the most glaring technical concerns and stick to rating the content.</p></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><p>From a technical point of view encouraging a site wide use of the [DRAFT] tag in the forum topic until it's ready to go is actually the easiest way to do it. I'm not sure at the moment if I can make one flag dependant on another to disable the possiblity of something being recommended for the front page (I will find out if it's feasible though). [DRAFT] if everyone agrees on it - is guranteed to work.</p></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

Tags are more flexible, more all-encompassing, and allow for a <em>much</em>&nbsp;broader search range. Have a "Rrakkma" tag, but don't limit Rrakkma-related content to a Rrakkma section. This way it gets more exposure if someone just searches for "gith" or "npcs" or so on. And really, if someone <em>just</em>&nbsp;wants Rrakkma content, how hard is it to search for "rrakkma?"</p><p>As has been mentioned, though, Rrakkma gets a comparatively tiny amount of site traffic, most of which is probably used strictly by regulars and people that know what's there. Its forums are active and I certainly think that should be kept, but I don't think it should get extra special attention.</p></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><p>Here's my 2cp.</p><p>I would like the articles to stay, but be better organized. Furthermore, I think the site should have some guidelines for what constitutes an article vs. a forum post. For instance, something describing a new planar location in great detail should be an article, while something discussing ideas for planar locations should be a forum topic.</p><p>Having some form of organized archive of user-created content is particularly useful. Forums are wonderful, but they aren't particularly organized. If I want to browse for new planar critters, I want to go to the Creature Codex.</p><p>I'd organize the articles by (A) Plane, (B) type of article, (C) Special Tag. Plane is self-explanatory. NPCs, Creatures, Spells, Equipment, Magic all would be different Types. Special tags might include Rrakma - something I may not be interested in, but others might. Consider the Special tag to be a "Theme".</p><p>Another thing I think should be fixed is the submission form itself. It is buggy, and sometimes difficult to use. Right now, the different organizational categories are all lumped together (sort of). If the submission process were easier, more writers might create articles.</p><p>Another thing we might consider is some sort of promotion of a particular forum post to Article status (or draft Article status).</p><p>I also feel that the blogs seem to be useless and counter-productive. I've never seen the benefit of a blog on a site like PW - they're more appropriate for personal sites where someone wants to soapbox about something.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><p>re: projects - I generally just keep an ear open when someone says they want to do something - and if they have enough interest and momentum it will eventually get it's own forum. So very much what you guys have already been saying. It's just been that long since we had an active project.----- Ok folks,It's been about two weeks since I set this thread up and we're coming up on a long holiday (perfect time to upgrade, I've lots of spare time to fix something if it breaks). Bear with me - this is a long post, but it outlines my work for the next few days here.So here's what the plan looks like - with the upgrade to Drupal 6:a) The main page is going to stay the main page. We are NOT moving to a just-forums site. (That was never on the table actually, but I wanted to make it clear as there was some confusion about that earlier.)b) New sub menu system. No articles are going to be deleted. All of this is just a reorganization into how we are getting at our articles to make it more logical for new readers. Not all sections will be renamed, and all existing subsections will continue to exist in a tagging format so you Can get to what was there befor by subject matter. If you're still a little lost - I know the explination here is pretty technical - What it boils down to is: I've paid attention to the concerns on not finding the stuff you're looking for and will be trying to preserve existing relationships between articles so you Can get to them in some way shape or form. But we really *need* cleaner navigation for new readers - cause we really *need* new readers. Some features - specifical collections of informaiton - will remain named submenues (@ Azure - This includes the LSE, and other IC papers <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/wink.png" title="Eye-wink" alt="Eye-wink" class="smiley-content"/> ) some features will be boiled down further. This will be a somewhat fluid/responsive reconfiguration of the site, so I will be asking for feedback again on it after a week has passed. I want a week so that my Google statistics can tell me if we've changed the traffic patterns any.c) Blogs will be discontinued. Sorry guys, consensus seems to be that they just dilute our attention way too much. Existing blog entries will continue to exist in the system.d) Article submission will change slightly, to more readily and easily accept articles from the forums as our primary input system.&nbsp; This will include a button to allow other users to flag content as front-page worthy. On the manager end (for Loki's clarification) there will probably be an additional button for us to set somethign as a formal article and allow it to appear promoted on the front page, and in the views for article promotion and categories etc. Future updates may evolve into a self-regulating voting system, but we need more traffic to make that worthwhile. Secondary input from articles will still be possible but the workflow for that is still a little up in the air.e) Forums may recieve a minor reshuffle to make navigation easier.f) New theme with new location of menus - will look mostly like the existing ones though.g) Complete revision of the encyclopedia. We will be ditching the book module driving it - converting existing entries to a new article type, and cleaning up the navigation. Expect further changes and community driven efforts to improve it once the conversion has settled in.h) For the moment we will be rolling back on using WYSIWYG input features, and reverting to plain text with BBCode. <span style="font-weight:bold">This. Is. Temporary.</span> I need to clean up some of our existing input issues before working on a WYSIWYG interface - and BBCode is reliable as heck.i) Blocks and menus visible on the main page will be visible on the forums page as well, for seamless presentation of information.Stuff I will need from others once this is up:a) Help pages, Loki is working on an introduction to the site already - if you see a need for other pages, please mention it on the thread or work with Loki on it so once we're up I can integrate it into the page.b) Promotion on our new system - the only way to test if we have successfully made ourselves more newbie friendly is... with... newbies. <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/wink.png" title="Eye-wink" alt="Eye-wink" class="smiley-content"/> Get my drift?c) We will be moving to execute some community driven activites shortly after setting up - this includes things like adding art to the encyclopedia, or restructing projects, etc. So keep an ear open for that.The technical plan:Tonight: I will upgrade all of our Drupal 5 modules and deactivate a number of existing feature sets that are going to go away. (Blogs etc). I will also take a snapshot of our database to test an upgrade with.Saturday morning: I will do a dry run of that upgrade to make sure I have everything in order.Late Saturday / Sunday morning: Planewalker will go down. We will have a deactivation of the existing site so I don't lose data on the migration. I will execute the upgrade, test, and do all initial configurations under Drupal 6 to get us in shape. IF THIS FAILS: There will be a copy of the site under Drupal 5 kept around for us to fall back to. My plan is to have the site back up by Sunday at noon - either on the new system, or reverted to the old one.Monday - I will go through the new install for additional configurations, CSS modifications, or other needed feature sets.My contact: <script type="text/javascript">eval(unescape('%64%6f%63%75%6d%65%6e%74%2e%77%72%69%74%65%28%27%3c%61%20%68%72%65%66%3d%22%6d%61%69%6c%74%6f%3a%63%6c%75%65%6c%65%73%73%40%70%6c%61%6e%65%77%61%6c%6b%65%72%2e%63%6f%6d%50%6c%65%61%73%65%22%3e%63%6c%75%65%6c%65%73%73%40%70%6c%61%6e%65%77%61%6c%6b%65%72%2e%63%6f%6d%50%6c%65%61%73%65%3c%2f%61%3e%27%29%3b'))</script> scream ASAP if you see something major I've left off.</p></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><p>Ok - we're back up.</p><p>The majority of what needed done got done - but there are some major elements still in need of being worked on. These mostly include a revision of input formats, freelinks and the wiki as a whole.</p><p>New theme has been tested under Firefox 3.5, IE6, IE7, IE8. All but IE6 are spiffy cool - I apologize to IE6 users,but I had to make some CSS modifications to get the navbar to work, and it's not as awesome looking as I'd prefer.</p><p><strong>For this week we are in bug hunt mode.</strong></p><p><strong>Please remember when you tell me about a bug to include your browser, your version of the browser, and your OS. Also - what you did to make it go all wierd on you.</strong></p><p><em>Known Issues:</em></p><p>Dice Roller is inactive at the moment. I need to fix some database tables to get her back up.</p><p>Wiki links are broke. (Have been broke truth be told) Need to execute some very risky database scrubbing to attempt to reconnect those.</p><p>Wiki input as a whole isn't right. Need to update the filter once we get the articles somewhat reasonably connected.</p><p>Main forum input also isn't right. It probably needs to move more towards BBCode and drop the WYSIWYG format input - but I will gladly accept input from you guys on that subject. How do you want the formatting to work?</p><p>Search - the entire site is being re-indexed. You won't be able to do searching by anything but tags and keywords for the moment. Sorry but there were almost a gig worth of search entries *alone*. It had to get blasted away in the course of the upgrade or we wouldn't have been able to upgrade at all. We're now indexing with the PorterStemmer algorithm, which hopefully will make searches more effective once the site is re-indexed.</p></p> <div class="dice_rolls">
