         <p><span style="font-style:italic">I suppose this makes me the first entry. Yea. I'm sure this entry will soon be followed by an army of much better written and more intresting NPCs, but this is my entry. So, here it is, hope you like it.</span></p>

<p>Name: Mark Jenkard<br />
Race: Human<br />
Gender: Male<br />
Alignment: Lawful Neutral<br />
Class: Fighter 5<br />
Faction: Unaffiliated</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Appearance</span><br />
The first impression that comes to mind when looking at Mark is drunk barbarian. A 42 year old man who the multiverse hasn’t been kind to, Mark easily blends in with the locals. The most notable thing about Mark is the armor he is wearing; despite being battered it is obviously that a lot of time has been put into caring for it.</p>

<p>Mark tries to carry himself in a manner befitting a warrior; metal armor on with a sharpened sword ready whenever necessary. Both the armor and weapon are from Mark’s adventuring days, and although neither is particularly magical, Mark is very sentimentally attached to them. The wear and tear of adventures past and time has left a few scratches on the armor, but both armor and blade are fully functional. Mark takes a bit of pride in maintaining his old adventuring gear. In a way, it’s all he has left.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Personality</span><br />
Mark used to be an adventurer in Sigil until he ran into a little trouble. As such, he is now unable to leave Ysgard. While Ysgard is by no means the worst place a berk could end up (Carceri comes to mind), Mark misses the wide open possibilities of the planes.</p>

<p>Mark is particularly proud of his sword and armor, as they are relics from his adventuring days. Asking about them or complimenting them will usually receive a favorable response.</p>

<p>If asked about his history, the current state of affairs, or anything that relates to it, Mark will tell the PCs about his past. Most retellings will end up with Mark advising the PCs not to make his mistake.</p>

<p>Despite his semi-imprisonment and retirement, Mark is a reasonably nice guy. He truly envies most planewalkers who still are able to travel the planes freely. He’ll happily trade stories from his adventuring days with whoever comes by, although most information he has is at least five years old. Mark also knows a few secret treasure stashes and adventure hooks that he never got a chance to look into; again all information is at least five years old. Sigil remains a sore point and he will become a bit depressed whenever the City of Doors is mentioned.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">History</span><br />
For many years, Mark was part of a fairly successful adventuring group. Providing an able sword, Mark took a large amount of pride in his job. Although by no means famous, the group did manage scratch out a living. </p>

<p>One night, that all changed. About five years ago, he got drunk with a couple of his adventuring friends down in the Hive. By the time the barkeep kicked the sods out, they couldn’t tell the difference between a tiefling and a mind flayer. While they were drunk out of their minds, they ran into a dabus. One thing led to another and they ended up assaulting the innocent thing. Of course, they had no weapons and couldn’t hit a brick wall, but they still managed to whack him a few times. Not enough to kill him, but still enough to be considered assault. Mark, through some strange twist of fortune, got separated from his buddies and ended up falling through a portal to Ysgard, where he spent the night. Next morning, Mark woke up and huge headache and remembered exactly what he had done.</p>

<p>Mark is convinced that The Lady is out to get him for attacking her dabus. He won’t step foot in Sigil, and is a bit paranoid that The Lady is going to send mess with the next portal he enters to send him straight to the Grey Waste or an equally bleak plane. He won’t enter any proven portal, won’t mess with teleporting magic, and is a bit leery around anything that looks a bit too magical. The Lady, being the being that she is, is of course a complete mystery. Maybe The Lady isn’t particularly concerned with Mark; maybe she really would send him to the Waste. Mark may be a bit paranoid, but you’d be hard-pressed to find someone who envies Mark’s position.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">The Dark:</span> Mark never actually laid a finger on the dabus. While his friends were being soddin idiots, Mark was puking his guts out nearby. Mark doesn’t remember this and thinks he helped attack the dabus.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Motivations</span><br />
Mark wants to spend the rest of his days in peace. He still misses the planes, and often is found seeking adventure in Ysgard. He’ll happily join the PCs (as long as they remain in Ysgard) in an attempt to relive his adventuring days. Despite his current situation, Mark remains an adventurer and planewalker at heart.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Location</span><br />
Mark refuses to enter any portal willingly, convinced that he is that The Lady is just waiting to punish him. As such, he can always be found somewhere in Ysgard, most often in a tavern getting drunk, trading war stories, or just looking for work.<br />
	<br />
<span style="text-decoration:underline">Hook</span><br />
Mark has heard rumors that Elthan, one of his old buddies who was drinking with him when they attacked the dabus, is still alive. He desperately wants to reestablish contact with his old friend, but is terrified of going through a portal to find him. Mark wants the PCs to go find Steve and tell him about Mark.</p>

<p>As stated before, Mark will also join the PCs while they stay in Ysgard.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

          Most Interesting Planescape NPC Writing Contest        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Seeing as how the entries for this contest are still rather sparse and I had a few minutes to spare, I have decided to offer up my own NPC for evaluation. Since I already have a *.pdf version of <span style="font-style:italic">Hellbound</span>, this submission is more of a whim than anything else, and I would much prefer if that be taken into account by the judges. I'm not playing to win here, just to play.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Name</span><br />
Whistle</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Appearance</span> <br />
<span style="font-style:italic">A lithe wisp of a girl walks confidently and lightheartedly through the refuse strewn streets of the Hive, surrounded by a small flock of young orphans and street urchins. She is of that indeterminate age that is still regarded as a child by adults and yet looked up to as an authority figure by younger children. Her bright gray eyes shine from beneath a mane of tangled black hair, and her otherwise attractive face is barely discernable beneath the layer of grime that covers her from head to tattered sandals. Her baggy clothes, many sizes too large for her thin frame, are equally dirty, but the thin sundress that she wears over them is a defiantly bright lemon-lime. She pauses from an ongoing conversation with her young charges to give you a inquisitive look that seems wise beyond her years, but seeing that you pose no threat, she quickly breaks into a puckish grin and continues on with her discussion and her way.</span></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">History</span><br />
Whistle was first noticed around the Hive about a year ago, wearing that same bohemian outfit that so stands out amid the squalor. She earned her name from her habit of whistling random merry tunes when not otherwise engaged, and she gladly accepted it as her own. Indeed, Whistle has hitherto refrained from revealing anything about her past, including her real name, saying that it is the future that she is more concerned with. For a long while, the only attention she received from the older Hivers was the occasional bemused glance, but she promptly befriended the local guttersnipes and assumed the guiding maternal role in the group.</p>

<p>While hardly the first teenager to form such a <span style="font-style:italic">gang</span> of neglected Hiver kids, Whistle uses her authority for a nobler purpose than petty crime. In fact, she attempts to instill a self-respecting morality in her charges, teaching them of the potential rewards of honest work and guiding them to improve their own lots by helping others rather than taking advantage of them. For instance, she has worked out a deal with the eponymous proprietor of Allesha's Bakery to provide her pack with daily food in exchange for their help with various tasks around the establishment.</p>

<p>Slowly, Whistle's charges have grown more likely to help deliver food to the starving old lady on Shatterbone Street than to throw rocks through her windows like they would have before. Because of this change, the group has begun to earn a sort of admiration, bordering on trust, from the surrounding Hivers. Some of the other ragamuffin gangs are even trying to follow their example, albeit with varying amounts of success. The area where Whisper's pack makes kip, a few blocks from Allesha's Pantry, has begun to acquire a friendlier, almost neighborhood-like, atmosphere. While the Hive is still very much the Hive, young Whistle has managed to brighten it just a bit, bringing hope to the hopeless.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">The Dark</span><br />
Even though Whistle appears as a young human or tiefling girl, she is actually Vevila O Failbhe, a Ghaele Eladrin from Arborea. She escaped to Sigil from a particularly unsuccessful incursion into the Abyss, but when she saw the depressing bleakness of Hiver life, she vowed to help the unfortunate and often misguided souls to improve their lot. Assuming the disguise of a young Hiver girl, she teaches the next generation of Hivers to act above their upbringing. Occasionally, Vevila leaves her adopted kids in the care of her new friend Allesha and, resuming her Eladrin form, goes adventuring in the name of Good. Any income she earns from such forays is donated to the Pantry in recompense for the extra food required to feed her adopted kids and the Hiver elderly to whom they now deliver.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Hook</span><br />
While passing through the Hive for whatever reason, the PC's run into an unusually well-behaved street urchin trying to escape from an older bully. After presumably rescuing him, the heroes are told of Whistle and invited to the Pantry. There, Allesha quietly tells them that Whistle is actually Vevila and has gone missing on her latest excursion to the Lower Planes. She pleads with them to find the Ghaele and deliver her safely back to the worried children.</p>

          Havoc        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>The following is based on a character that a player in one of my games created several years ago.</p>

<p>Name: Havoc<br />
Race: Ooze Genasi (magical paring of human and Ooze para-elemental)<br />
Gender: Male and Female<br />
Alignment: CN<br />
Class: rouge 8 cleric 8<br />
Faction: Transcendent Order ("Ciphers")</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Appearance</span>: Havoc is a tall and lanky person who appears vaguely human but with green tinged skin that is oily. Havocs hair is scraggly, unkept and it appears wet. Like the skin, it is oily to the touch. There is an oily film over most of Havocs belongings and this residue is left on most things Havoc touches. In addition there is an odd, but faint  smell that emanates from havoc at all times. A sickly-sweet smell of onion and body odor.<br />
Havoc usually wears dark clothing, he prefers a hooded cloak and studded leather armor during the evening. During the day she wears more reveling clothing, often brightly colored tight fitting.<br />
On any given day, if one encounters havoc she appears to be a comely female. Though she is somewhat attractive, the odd smell and oily, unkept appearance keep most men away. During the evening Havoc is no longer a female, he appears as a rather unattractive male instead. This is due to a curse on Havoc that causes gender to change depending on the time of day. At night Havoc is a male and during the day havoc is a female. Havoc's original gender is unknown to most because he/she doesn't like to say. The dark of it is that he was once a man.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Personality</span>: Havoc is described by most as perverted. During the day Havoc is constantly active and ever on the move. She enjoys playing pranks on anyone she meets, including those she really should be leaving alone. She does not appear to have regard for anyones personal property or their privacy. However this lack of respect for others is not out of any personal desire to be disrespectful and she is not intentionally harmful in any way (though she is often unintentionally harmful). Havoc simply has a naivety about her. she appears unaware that she is being rude and is often confused by the reactions of others towards her. <br />
During the evening Havoc becomes almost paranoid, he is almost in constant motion and his attention span seems to cease to exist. He still enjoys playing pranks and still does not seem to have regard for the privacy or property of others however, when a man, Havoc sometimes takes his pranking too far. In addition to his other wild behavior, during the night, havocs most disturbing habit is revealed. This habit is what Havoc is most known for in Sigil, Havoc has an addiction to stealing woman's undergarments and he has the uncanny ability to be able to steal them from women who are still wearing them, sometimes without even their knowing.<br />
During any time of day Havoc will usually speak his or her mind with absolutely no tact whatsoever and always acts without thinking. This has, over the years, caused Havoc and his friends (mostly his friends) no end of trouble.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">History</span>: Havocs origins are unknown, even Havoc cannot (or will not) say when he or she was born. Havoc does say where he or she was born, usually though, the answer is not the same one twice.<br />
For the last two hundred years or so, (havocs life span is not the same as other genasi, no one can say how long it is expected to live) Havoc has lived in Sigil. Havoc tends to latch on to a particular group of people, often adventurers, and stay with them for a time before unexpectedly moving on. <br />
Early in his life, before the curse that alters his gender and before he was bonded with the Ooze para-elemental, Havoc spent several years wandering the planes with no place to call home, he never felt that he fit in wherever he went. Havoc eventually came to a place on the elemental plane of earth where he inadvertently wandered in to a fortress owned by slavers. He was enslaved for a number of weeks, however his attitude made him a poor slave. Havoc was cast in to a mud pit that the slavers say had no bottom. The slavers use the pit to dispose of things they do not want found. The pit is actually an elemental conduit that leads to the para-plane of Ooze. There, on the Ooze-Plane, Havoc nearly drowned. Somehow through an unknown process cased by the mingling  of the unnatural mixture of the stuff that makes up the Ooze-plane, Havocs own body and some species of Ooze para-elemental, Havoc became the only known Ooze genasi. Havoc, despite his new status as an Ooze elemental being, did not remain long on the Ooze-Plane. He left there as soon as he could and continued his wandering.<br />
Several years later while traveling on the Outlands Havoc encountered a female Dow priestess and her entourage. Havoc became smitten with her and followed the priestess for some time. One night he crept in to the dow camp and decided to enter the priestesses tent. His infatuation with female undergarments overriding any common-sence or sanity, Havoc entered the tent. In her rage the priestess cursed the unfortunate genasi so that he would become a female. For an unknown reason the curse only took affect during the day, at night Havoc became male again. Ever since then Havoc has changed from male to female countless times. Given the nature of the planes, many places do not have a defined "night and day". Because of this havoc often changes from male to female seemingly at random when traveling the planes. She may enter a portal and become a man because it is night there. Later he may purchase transport back to Sigil where it is daytime and become a woman, only to become a man again in an hour when evening arrives.<br />
In the past few years until about a year and a half ago Havoc has been seen in the company of a Tiefling wizard named Ezri and her fire Genasi companion who calls himself Maul. He stayed with them in a tower that Ezri owns in Sigil's market ward for a number of years.<br />
Since that time until very recently Havoc spent a time on the prime material plane. He was apparently looking for something that he considered very important to himself, though no one is quite sure what it is he is trying to find or if he has found it yet.<br />
In recent days Havoc has been seen on the streets of Sigil again. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Motivations</span>: Havoc's main motivation (at least during the night) seems to be to collect as many female undergarments as he can. He has an impressive number of undergarments stashed in various locations around Sigil. <br />
In recent years he/she spent time searching the material plane for some unknown purpose, it is not clear if Havoc found what he/she was looking for.<br />
In addition, as always, Havoc is constantly searching for acceptance. He/She continues to wander Sigil and occasionally the planes in search of friends and fun to be had.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Where likely encountered</span>: Sigil or the outlands. if anywhere else, Havoc will likely be traveling with adventurers.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Other important facts</span>: If havoc is reduced to less than zero hit points he/she instantly melts away in to a pool of Ooze and if left alone he will eventually regenerate and become Havoc again. Also, as a cleric havoc cannot turn or rebuke undead, instead he has the ability to command Ooze based creatures and elementals.<br />
In addition, many people do not realize havoc has this curse that changes his or her gender. A lot of people in Sigil believe Havoc is actually two people, a twin brother and sister. This is not true, but Havoc sometimes enjoys letting people think it is true.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Hook</span>: Havocs obsession with undergarments may lead to an encounter with a female member of an adventuring party. But the most likely reason characters may encounter Havoc would have to do with the quest he is perpetually on. Whatever it is he is searching for, it is not clear if he has found it so he may link up with adventurers in an effort to continue his quest for whatever it is he is seeking. Havoc has been around for a long time and it is likely he or she may know some useful piece of information the characters could use. Havoc is likely to ask if he or she could travel with the characters for a while. He enjoys approaching potential adventuring companions in the evening. This way he can make plans to meet them the next day. Then she will show up and confuse the unfortunates who are often unaware of her curse.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Here's my little contribution...</p>

<p>Name: Asharon<br />
Race: Fire Genasi<br />
Gender: Male<br />
Alignment: Neutral Good<br />
Class: Fighter 5<br />
Faction: None</p>

<p>Appearance.<br />
Old, tall, slightly muscled and standing at six and a half foot tall, the fire genasi Asharon sticks out like a sore thumb and his red tinged skin doesnt help. A charcoal grey top knot adons his head though as he moves it shakes with a slight reddish tinge that fades and reappears. He wears a suit of scale mail that shimmers like his hair and has a longsword sheathed at his waist, the scabbard plain and unassuming. The striking feature of Asharon is however the bandage that runs across his eyes as Asharon is in fact blind.</p>

<p>Personality.<br />
For a fire genasi Asharon is very quiet, possible from the many wounds he has suffered over his long years both physically and mentally. He is however a hospitable person when approached kindly and will often share a cup of bub or two. His blindness he doesnt see as a curse however and if asked will brush it off depending on the question or tell some old story of his other wounds though never of his blindness. He is sometimes prone to the inner fire that burns in all fire genasi and if provoked into attack he will not walk away.</p>

<p>History.<br />
Asharon was born in the City of Brass to unknown parents. He grew up in a Djinn palace as an errand boy, until in his teens he was caught practicing with a sword and caught the eye of one of the guards. After a thourough discipline he was sent to the guard quarters to be trained as a bodyguard. Several years passed as Asharon trained and was sent out on various missions to protect his masters goods until he was sold off to a mercenary company passing through the city. Asharon served well as a mercenary fighting in numerous battles across several planes before the band he was in were enlisted into a Baatezu army. This is where many believe Asharon was dealt the wound that caused his blindness. Asharon was the only survivor of his band and after a few years of wandering he wound up in Sigil.</p>

<p>Motivations.<br />
Asherons motivations are fleeting things, on the outside he is stoic but on the inside he is brimming with emotions, revenge crosses his mind from time to time. More often then not Asheron will practice his sword techniques trying to perfect them even with his blindness.</p>

<p>Where likely encountered.<br />
Sigil. Most likely in a inn close to the gymnasium where he practices his sword.</p>

<p>Other important facts.<br />
Asheron if provoked and or attacked will most likely choose to fight indoors. Using his control flame ability he sucks the light out of torches or lanterns inside buildings engulfing the area in darkness and using his combat techniques he has learnt to use with his blindness he cuts his adversaries to pieces. Asheron will more then likely make a fighting retreat if caught outdoors and provoked to fight. The sword at his hip is a +1 Flaming Longsword though the flame it emites mirrors Asherons mood, when encountered and unprovoked the flame is slight and black in colour, when provoked it spurs into the usual bright red/yellow flame.</p>

<p>Plot Hook.<br />
As an experienced mercanary Asheron is sometimes called on for techniques or information on various forces he has been known to have fought against. Another reason many approach him is to learn how to fight blind as Asheron has learnt. Or maybe just the dark on how he lost his eyesite.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Well, this is my submission. Sorry any bad semantics. I am not a native english speaker. []s.<br />
Defier</p>

<p>Aron the Caged (Prime Human male/Aristocrat 3/Wizard 9/Fraternaty of Order/Lawful Neutral)</p>

<p>History/Motivations/Personality: Aron Kalister is a former prince from a prime world (your choice), promised to a beautiful bride and destined to be eventually king on the passing of his father. But now this majestic future is all but gone, he is now a prisoner of Sigil. <br />
	Thirty years ago Aron and some young snob fellow’s nobles come to Sigil in a kind of rapid planar tourism trip. But what it seems to be just a little exotic fun, quickly became a nightmare. Being a band of arrogant clueless primes, moved to much wine, the young nobles screw up and bullied with dabus all day long. In no time the bullies were tossed away into a Maze by the Lady. But strangely the fate of Aron was different. The Lady’s just floated away of the unharmed and terrified prince. The others are gone to never been seen again, but nothing was done with him. Or so it seems.<br />
	In the first opportunity Aron tried to use the portal back home. But the damned thing just doesn’t worked for him for some reason, but it looks fine for everyone else. After many more tries Aron gave up and moved to try some new route across the planes utilizing others portals. But for his horror he soon realized that no single portal in Sigil worked for him anymore. In the Cage he was caged!<br />
	Months latter after the incident at the end of his resources and almost desperate, he became a member of the Fraternity of Order. He reasoned that the only hope of finding a solution for his problem was to understand the laws and patterns of Sigil, especially those relative to portals and planar travel. Besides the Faction philosophy was in the mood with his own temperament. As a guvner, Aron began just as a mere humble Aid, but over thirty years he is by now an A1 Factotum administrator, responsible to catalog the portals of Sigil. In this time he became quite accomplished with wizardry too as a way to help him in discovering the magic connected with the portals of the city. <br />
	But what Aron really hopes is not to advance into the hierarchy of the Guvners or even to become a more powerful wizard for that matter. What really drives him is the desire to find a way to come back to his home world and reclaim his rightful kingdom. Once in power, he will reward royally anyone who helps him to accomplish this objective. <br />
With his position in the guvners and his magic, Aron scans Sigil constantly in search for the right portal that will free him from the Cage. Because of this he is a long term client of the tiefling Alluvius Ruskin*, that provides him with new portal keys to test.<br />
	Over the years Aron dislike for Sigil just increased. He now despises the city and envies the liberty of those who can use freely the myriad of portals of the city. This has reflected in his personality, once a jovial prince, but now a bitter old one, always muttering over the king he never was. In the last years this had transformed in a little more annoying behavior. He comports himself more and more like if he was a king in exile (what technically he possible is) and like one demands respect and obedience from whom he meets. Most people of course just laugh from the very idea. Aron becomes frustrated and infuriated but never became violent as a result. The only real serious delusion that affects him is the believe that his beloved promised princess is waiting as youth and cast for his return as the day he departed. He tells her name in praise as an example of virtue to his few friends between the guvners and to anyone he becomes acquainted. </p>

<p>Appearance: Well, Aron in fact has a royal appearance over him at lest. Into the right clothing he would just looks like a king, if king he was. He is a tall and fine man with a well cut beard with shades of gray and inquisitive blue eyes. His manners could be also described as royal. </p>

<p>Where likely encountered: in the City Courts or anywhere in Sigil looking for and testing portals that could function for him. A failed task so far. </p>

<p>DMs dark: the key of Aron freedom lies again with the Lady. Aron was really mazed after all, but his maze unlike others, is Sigil itself! Like every other maze of the Lady there’s one way out. But the key to this is even more strange: to cross the path of the Lady again! If Aron do this (for some metaphysical reason that just her Serenity knows) he will be free again to use any portal of Sigil, even the portal to his prime world. But of course after the ominous first immediate encounter with her, the old prince doesn’t want to cross the Lady’s path again.</p>

<p>Adventure/plot hook: primarily the pcs can search Aron for information about portals of the city (Aron has quite a list) in return he just asks the localization of a new portal for his catalogue. Additionally Aron can search and contract the pcs to protect him from Ramander the Wise** from the Fated, the self proclaimed Master of Portals that wants his catalogue. Otherwise Aron wants for himself the catalogue from Lissandra the Gate-seeker*, another person with an extensive list of portals, he can contract the pcs to “ask” Lissandra to “borrow” her list. And last but not least, he wants that someone hunt down and stops the gate crasher knows as the Grixxit* for obvious reasons.<br />
The DM can also develop a plot involving the key to Aron freedom which means an immediate encounter with the Lady and possibly a “visit” to the mazes!  If they survive to this, the quest can continue in escorting Aron to his prime world and helping him to become king, what can be quite a problem, because thirty years have passed and by now he is considered dead by all.</p>

         <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Name:</span> Shirketh ib Narru, The Apostate<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Race:</span> Yugoloth <span style="font-weight:bold">Caste:</span> Arcanoloth<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Gender:</span> N/A, generally thought of as male.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Age:</span> Millenia<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Class:</span> Sorcerer 2/ Archmage 3</p>

<p>I watched the fiend closely. He seemed rather at ease, as though used to the surroundings, though surely he couldn't have been here before. But... he was yugoloth, and an arcanoloth at that. With all the whispered rumours about them across the planes you could almost think anything was possible if they were involved. "So..." he said, taking a sip of the Gehannian Fire Wine I had gone to so much effort to procure. "You wish to learn of my history. There is certainly much I can tell you. I have, after all, lived for what could seem to a meer half-breed as yourself an eternity.I could tell you of when I first scrabbled from the bare colourless earth of the Wastes in the shadow of Khin-Oin, a lowly, mewling mezzoloth, and looked up at the tower that lay before me, knowing it for what it was, a depicition of the superiority of the Yugoloth race. I could tell you of my time as a hydroloth, swimming the lengths of the Styx finding locations of Tanari and Baatzu encampments and reporting them back to my commanders and all the while learning what it was to truly be yugoloth. Perhaps you would like to learn of my time as a Marraenoloth, one of the Styx boatmen, ferrying passengers along the dark river and all the while watching and learning. I might tell you of the battles I presided over as a Nycoloth, or my ascent to the noble caste of which I am now a member. He paused here, and sighed, as if recalling fond memories, before continuing; "But no, you do not wish to learn of these things. I expect you, like so many others, wish to know of what came after my time in the Tower Arcane, after I decided to end my servitude to the dark general and his shadowy masters. I nodded my assent. He sighed again. I thought as much. That's the trouble with ones such as yourself. You fail to learn the values of patience. That you can discover more by listening to the story of a "hero"..."he pronounced this word with a dripping sarcasm"...before his rise to fame than you can of what came next. But I have said I will tell you what you wish to know and so I will. Now what shall I speak of? Perhaps I shall tell you of my journey to the four cardinal points of the Great Wheel in search of "The Light of Truth", or maybe of the time I aided the Great Khan of the Dao in repelling a small, though significant, force of Djinn assassins."</p>

<p>He paused for a moment, deep in thought, before raising his head and grinning at me. It was, I must say, a slightly disturbing sight as, for a brief moment, he almost looked as you would expect of an arcanoloth, ready to bring a scheme to culmination. "I know"he said, a note of triumph on his voice. I'll tell you of my time in Sigil, the heart of the planes, and the place where I foiled that wonderful little scheme of Shemeska. He sighed again. Ah, dear Shemeska. That little plot of hers would have gained her a significant amount of wealth you know. Along with quite a large portion of Arborea. But it's easy to stop the plot of a Yugoloth. Their schemes are grand, and always well thought out but, sadly, it's a problem with the race overall that makes it so easy to foil them. They're so overcome with their own superiority that they can't ever believe that anything can go wrong with their plans. And so, if you find the lynch-pin and remove it, you can watch as the entire scheme crumbles around their ears, as they finally comprehend what it is to be imperfect."He chuckled, rather merrily, at this thought though I suppose it's no suprise given some of the rumours. He finally stopped and raised his glass "But before I begin this little tale, a toast, "To the unravelling of yugoloth schemes" I turned to pick up my glass and felt a small sharp pain in the side of my neck. Reaching up to it I found and pulled out a small feathered dart. I gaped in horror at my grinning guest as my vision began to blur, and as the darkness closed in taking me to oblivion I thought I heard a voice, just a few words. "To the unravelling of Yugoloth schemes"</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Physical Description:</span><br />
When deigning to appear before mortals in his true form, Shirketh is approximately seven feet in height and thin enough that, were he disrobed, you could almost count the bones in his body. His eyes are dark, almost black, and have a piercing quality that could make you think he were staring into the very depths of your soul, and counting the sins before you would be truly damned. His fur is a light tan colour, and is extremely well kept. Slightly longer than that of most arcanoloths, you could almost say that it's rather fluffy. His right ear is covvered with earings, golden twists and spirals that form a pattern no mere mortal eye could follow. Some speculate that this is to draw attention away from his mangled and torn left ear. If asked about how this happened he will generally give the questioner a rather pointed look before changing the topic to something completely different. (Rumor says that it happened when he was escaping from a group of Bladeling assassins on Ocanthus) He typically dresses in flamboyant azure robes trimmed with gold, and studded with enough gemstones that you could not just ransom a king for it, but an entire kingdom. He also usually carries around with him  a long white staff*.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Personality Description:</span> <br />
Charming and witty, polite and well-spoken, after all, these are part of the yugoloth stock-in-trade. It's difficult to convince a blood that you and only you can help him with his problem if you're foaming at the mouth half the time. Shirketh is happy to lie and just as happy to tell the truth if he thinks it will further his interests. One thing, and probably the only thing, that's certain about him is that he's not necessarily trustworthy... Unless he wants to appear so.  He is generally friendly to people when speaking to them, and has learned over the passage of the centuries to keep his temper in check. He is also careful to give an impression of genuinely wanting to be a good person, and will frequently deplore the actions of his fellow yugoloths, though in truth he is a violent and sadistic as any other ‘loth. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Motivations: </span><br />
Who can say what motivates a yugoloth. Greed? Certainly. Self interest? Probably. The dark is that most of what a yugoloth does is done to further the cause of Evil. Not mere evil, but Evil with a capital E. Course, Shirketh has left all that behind him now, or so he claims, though there are always those that say that a leopard can't change his spots. Admittedly he does tend to involve himself more with the affairs off others if he thinks he can make a nice profit out of it, but sometimes he'll involve himself when he apparantly gains no benefit whatsoever. What's suspected is that, in some of these cases he's working against the schemes of his bretheren in Gehanna and the Wastes, working to halt Yugoloth plans at crucial points. But these, like almost everything about yugoloths, are just rumours. But then, just because it's a rumour, doesn't mean it's not true...<br />
	Probably one of the only things that is known for certain about Shirketh, is that he shares a small, friendly rivalry with Shemeska the Marauder, King of the Crosstrade in Sigil. It’s to known precisely when this started, though it’s believed that the two were lovers at one time long ago. Whatever caused it, Shirketh is known to go to almost any level to thwart one of the Marauder’s schemes if he thinks he can get away with it. The Marauder, in turn, frequently has small bands of assassins sent after The Apostate, most of which are generally avoided by the Arcanoloth, though there have been some close calls on occasion.<br />
	The truth about Shirketh, is that he does what he does at the behest of Hekenelaith, Keeper of the Tower Arcane, in an effort to steer the Yugoloths into actions that would benefit the Yugoloth race as a whole. Any action which he would deem too risky to the position of the Yugoloths in the planes he will take steps to interfere with, wither causing it to stop completely, or guiding it along safer lines.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Where Likely Encountered:</span><br />
Shirketh can be found on any plane, from the Grey Wastes to Elysium. Though he tends to avoid Gehanna, he will occasionally visit to confer with colleagues in the Tower Arcane about matters of particular consequence to the future of the Yugoloth race. He also generally stays out of Sigil, only rarely visiting when he feels it necessary to personally supervise something.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Plot Hooks:</span><br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">1. </span>A powerful artifact of good has been stolen from the Order of the Planes Militant headquarters on Celestia.  Shirketh believes that the theft is the result of the machinations of a particular group of  Yugoloths from Gehanna. He, or more likely one of his agents, hires to party to investigate the theft. While in most circumstances Shirketh would allow the theft to pass, he fears that it may, if left unchecked, bring the Celestials’ attention to another, more subtle plot involving the leadership of the Order itself.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">2.</span> It is election time in Sigil once again, and the Marauder is once again up for a position on the Sigil Advisory Committee.  The problem is that this time she’s winning by a landslide, polls showing her to be far ahead of all opposition. Needless to say, Shirketh isn’t happy about that as it would allow the Marauder to interfere with his work in Sigil on a level far greater than before. He suspects  that there’s trickery afoot (a fair presumption when there are ‘loths about) and wants to hire the party to investigate the matter.</p>

<p>*<span style="font-weight:bold">Tysedeous</span><br />
His creator described him as "A colourful and useful travelling companion." Shirketh tends to describe Tysedeous as "A piking annoyance." This aside, he won't deny Tysedeous's usefulness, which is probably the intention of the person who gave him to the Apostate. Tysedeous was given to Shirketh after a rather interesting adventure on Mechanus involving a group of rogue modrons. The sender was unknown, though Shirketh has his suspicions that one of his enemies was behind it. You see, Tysedeous is a joke. A prank of sorts. By giving Shirketh an object as useful as Tysedeous, it ensured that he would be likely to get rid of it any time soon. Unfortunately, Tysedeous has an obsession. Mephits. Those pesky little annoyances from the inner planes. Given half the chance, Tysedeous will embark on lectures about the nature of these beings- where they come from, how they live, notable mephits of ages past and more. He can't get enough information about them. When he desides to embark on one of his tirades about the wonders of mephits, it can be very difficult to get him to stop again and despite numorous threats against the staff, Shirketh has yet to dispose of him.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Name:</span>		Ravanasti Swordsteward, a.k.a. Duana the Ashen<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Race:</span>		Tiefling (normally disguised as an aasimar)<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Gender:</span>		Female<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Alignment:	</span>		Lawful good, formerly neutral evil<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Class:</span>			Rogue 6, Wizard 11<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Faction:</span>			Unaffiliated, formerly a Fated Factor</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Appearance:</span><br />
Ravanasti Swordsteward is a short (5’1”) tiefling with jet black skin, pointed ears, and jagged teeth.  Her smooth skin has no body hair and her white eyes have no pupils (although her vision is normal for a tiefling).  However, she almost always uses magic and mundane disguises to hide her true appearance and typically chooses to appear as an aasimar.  She typically wears wizardly robes or a modestly cut dress of exquisite tailoring.  However, she will wear clothing appropriate to wherever she might travel.  She does not have any personal items that keeps with her at all times, save for her wedding band.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Personality:</span><br />
Ravanasti is outwardly friendly and is kind to a fault.  She strangely alternates between an air of extreme confidence and groveling humility.  She is generous to the poor but a terror to those who would abuse power or miscarry justice.  In any case, when asked too many personal questions, she becomes very guarded.  She tries to hide this guardedness by skillfully redirecting a conversation.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">History:</span><br />
To all outward appearances, Ravanasti is a mild mannered aasimar wizard who is married to Elandroth Swordsteward (aasimar, male, LG, paladin 14) and lives in Yetsirah on Jovar on Mount Celestia.  She is a close friend of Faith, current Factol of the Harmonium.  While her marriage and her friendship with Faith and other are definitely real, Ravanasti’s entire life has been built to hide a dangerous past.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dark:</span><br />
Ravanasti Swordsteward used to be Duana the Ashen and is wanted by no less than the General of Gehenna.</p>

<p>In the year leading up to the Faction War, Duana the Ashen had a meteoric rise from being a common Namer in the Fated to becoming a Factor.  This rise to power was due in large part to her work as a cold-blooded advocate who represented other Takers in legal proceedings involving other Factions.  She also helped fellow Takers litigate disputes over trade contracts with Baatezu, Yugoloths, and other lower planar denizens who commonly use legal contracts.  Of course, through all of this legal work, Duana gained an excellent reputation as an advocate, earned a considerable bit of personal wealth, and eventually claimed a nice office in the Hall of Records.</p>

<p>During this time, she also was tapped into a regular stream of rumors and adventuring opportunities.  She and her adventuring companions (who had very little interest in Faction politics) went on many dangerous adventures (mainly to the Lower Planes and including some distasteful mercenary work in the Blood War).  As a result of her lengthy dealings with fiends, she has an extensive knowledge about them.</p>

<p>At the time of the start of the Faction War, Duana the Ashen was a hard-nosed Factor with a reputation for ruthlessness and cut-throat tactics.  Many of the details of her personal involvement in the Faction War are confused.  However, it is known that she personally assassinated at least one Harmonium Factor.</p>

<p>What is far less known is that during the final moments of the Faction War, the General of Gehenna attempted to depose the Lady of Pain while she was occupied with other matters.  It is unclear as to how the General of Gehenna gained entry to Sigil but in appears that the Yugoloth Master must have slipped inside the city before the start of the Faction War.  Again, it is unclear as to what she exactly did, but somehow Duana was personally responsible for stopping the General of Gehenna’s plans for Sigil.</p>

<p>In some fiendish circles it is said that in exchange for her service to the city, the Lady of Pain imparted an unheard-of gift on Duana to make it impossible to learn anything about Duana through any form of divination.  While this may or may not be true, the General of Gehenna has placed an astounding price on Duana’s head and no one has yet been able to claim the reward.</p>

<p>Since the end of the Faction War, Duana the Ashen has undergone a radical change in personal philosophy.  After realizing that the example led by Rowan Darkwood would bring her in to direct conflict with the primal forces of the multiverse, she recognized her many crimes and moral failings, repented, and sought forgiveness.  She is now a champion of righteousness where she once had been the epitome of evil.</p>

<p>She no longer holds on to personal possessions for too long because on a recent trip to Sigil Shemeshka the Marauder appeared to recognize her magical staff and rapier.  After that trip, she panicked and discarded most of her personal belongings in Pandemonium where the maddening winds have destroyed them utterly.  When she needs a specific magic item for a specific purpose, she will acquire it, use it, and then give it to a hero in need.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Motivation:</span><br />
Ravanasti has one true motivation: to stay out of the prison that has been built for her in Gehenna.  However, knowing that she has so many personal wrongs to right, she often takes great personal risks to fight evil and injustice throughout the multiverse.  Where she cannot intervene directly, Ravanasti will often hire adventurers to perform certain tasks for her.  She pays well but always insists on a moral code of conduct from cutters under contract.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Location:</span><br />
Ravanasti Swordsteward is most likely to be met on Mount Celestia or on Arcadia.  However, since she has so many previous wrongs to right, she can be met nearly anywhere in the Outer Planes.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">General uses for the DM:</span><br />
Ravanasti can be worked in an existing campaign in a number of ways.  A DM can introduce her as patroness to the PCs or as a patroness to a rival group of adventurers.  She can also be sought out by PCs who need tumble to some dark about fiends.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">A better hook:</span><br />
Recently, the General of Gehenna, through countless intermediaries, reminded a pit fiend general about a certain resourceful tiefling mercenary who has another year of service through a “reactivation clause” in her contract which was signed with the pit fiend’s immediate predecessor.  Since the general is new to his position and because his predecessor demoted to a barbazu and shipped to the front lines of the Blood War, he is eager to undo any of his predecessor’s mistakes.  He has sent a number of erinyes to Sigil to track down the missing mercenary.  The erinyes, in turn, have been unsuccessful in finding the deserter.  Knowing that the price of failure will likely be demotion, one of the erinyes has decided to find a group of adventurers to do her job for her.  If successful, she hopes to corrupt additional souls while tracking down the deserter.  Of course, the missing mercenary is Duana the Ashen, now Ravanasti Swordsteward, and she does not want to be found.  While she has been very careful about hiding her old identity, a group of canny cutters may be able to piece together the clues left behind at the end of the Faction War.  A paper trail that starts in the Hall of Records may eventually lead to Mount Celestia.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>My humble entry</p>

<p>Name: Box <br />
Race: Unbodied<br />
Gender: N/A<br />
Age: About Four <br />
Alignment: Chaotic Good<br />
Class: Psion (Telepath) 3<br />
Faction: Xaositects</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Appearance:</span></p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">A sphere about eight inches in diameter hovers at eye level with you. It seems to be made of mercury and has a multi-colored oil-like sheen the constantly shifts color and shape. When you approach, you hear a faint but irritating humming in the back of your mind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Personality:</span></p>

<p>Box, like most Xaositects, is extraordinarily whimsical and unpredictable (except, of course when it isn’t). Despite this, he is reasonably stable and will not follow an obviously and immediately dangerous course of action. Box takes great joy in his unusual form and the reactions it provokes. A floating sphere made of Karach isn’t exactly a common sight anywhere–especially a talking one. Box often talks to itself telepathically. This usually manifests itself as a mental humming or murmuring that can be ‘heard’ by everyone within ten feet. </p>

<p>Box will often follow a random individual for no other reason than to observe. He may also play a prank on a particularly boring or lawful individual. This is usually something harmless, like telling incoherent knock-knock jokes in scramblespeak to members of the City Guard for several hours or wearing a sheet over itself and pretending to be a ghost with a floral print. Unfortunately, Box’s exceedingly poor judgment can lead to situations where someone may get hurt or their property damaged. Box generally feels regret for these incidents and does it best to prevent them since it believes they ruin the beauty of chaos. Box dislikes combat and will almost always run if threatened. Failing that, it will attempt to charm enemies. Box has very little in the way of offensive powers. <br />
 <br />
Box loves the color blue, and will generally react much better to anyone or anything that is blue. If asked, Box will say something to the effect of: “Xaositects generally don’t need a rational explanation for their like and dislikes.” </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">History:</span></p>

<p>Box was once the mind of a slightly barmy psion who performed a ritual to separate his mind from his body in order to better understand himself. Eventually, this psion bound his mind to a karach sphere for a reason only he knew. Eventually, time, and extreme boredom overcame the psion’s orderly mind. Over time, this new personality subsumed the original one. Box now exists solely to amuse itself and spread wonderful Xaos across the planes. </p>

<p>More recently, Box has gotten itself into some trouble with the City Guard, having accidentally burned down a small shop candle shop in the Market Ward while creating “pretty shapes” by telekinetically lifting lit candles. Fortunately nobody was hurt, although the City Guard wants Box to pay a fine for the damage it has caused.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Motivations:</span></p>

<p>Box is an idealistic Xaositect who sees great beauty in chaos. Logically (or perhaps not), Box seeks to spread its brand of beauty throughout the multiverse regardless of what the stiffer types think about it. It would love to see a brightly colored and constantly changing multiverse filled entirely with happy, funny people who don’t follow laws because they have no need for them. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Location:</span></p>

<p>Box can be found almost anywhere in the Cage, although it often haunts the streets near the Triad District so it can spread joy to the most lawful bashers in Sigil. Box ‘lives’ in an abandoned attic of a storehouse in the market ward. Here, it stores his few possessions–mostly random novelties that have caught it’s eye. The only certain thing that can be said of Box’s location is that it is never more than ten feet above the ground, as that is the highest it can levitate.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Plot Hooks:</span></p>

<p>The City Guard would like to find Box and make him pay damages to the owner of the shop it burnt down, though he is by no means seen as a real threat. As such, the reward offered is quite small. </p>

<p>More likely than not, box will be encountered on the streets, talking to himself in scramblespeak. A PC will most likely meet him because they were the target of one of his pranks or simply because they happened to be wearing something blue and Box has taken an interest in them because of it.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

          Allorian Moonsmile. Independent Thief        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Standard Statistics:</span> Allorian Moonsmile, aka “Jezzira Darksilver.” Female Air Genasi. Rogue 14. Alignment: Chaotic-Neutral (Evil) but detects as Chaotic Good.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Description: “Angles and freckles stretched over pale blue skin.”</span> Allorian is lanky and slight, measuring just over six feet tall. She has light blue skin with violet freckles, and black hair worn just past her ears in a stylish bob. Her hair is naturally white with blue stripes, but it is currently dyed black as part of her attempt to disguise herself. She usually wears a violet leather jacket and black breeches tucked into high leather boots. She carries many daggers about herself and moves with a languid gracefulness.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Personality: “Oh let’s not talk about me. My life is boring. But you seem to be someone…important.” </span>A born flirt, Allorian will speak with anyone, anywhere--for at least a minute or two. She spends most of her time lounging around public gathering places hoping to collect information relating to her quest (see below). Typically, Allorian will act bored or sigh loud enough to be overheard. If spoken to, she will respond with “I am simply waiting for something interesting. Are you interesting?” Whatever the PC’s reply, she’ll act interested for approximately twenty seconds before interrupting with “Tell me something interesting about yourself. What are you like?” She is seemingly interested in everything, fascinated by exotic sensations and experiences. However, she vehemently despises the Sensate faction and takes momentary offense at being labeled a Sensate herself.</p>

<p>When pressed about herself, Allorian is dismissive and mysterious. “I’m just another lonely cager—nothing interesting about me.” In a prolonged conversation, she is extremely mercurial, switching from being intensely interested in the PC’s and their visible items/clothing/gear, to being bored and rude. “I need to be entertained,” she says, exasperated, “not talked to death. But I like you, so I’ll give you another chance.”</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Short History: “I do whatever I need to get by…and I’m <span style="text-decoration:underline">very </span>good at whatever I do.”</span> Allorian is an agent of Sung Chiang, the Chinese god of Thieves. She grew up in the Hive and quickly became a successful thief due to a combination of skill, luck, and reckless daring. She established solid connections with every known thieves guild and managed to survive the guild wars when the Oddsblood Guild slew nearly every member of the Lightfingers and the Octopus guilds. Completely independent, Allorian felt no desire to seek vengeance on the thieves; instead, her survival instincts, usefulness, and ability to endear herself to high-level cutters (such as Joox Catseye, a High Priest of Loki in the Lower Ward, and Meera the Grasper, a Namer in the Fated and Administrator in the Hall of Records) brought her to the attention of Sung Chiang’s proxy Yasmeen Webwalker. Recruited in Hopeless, she quickly displayed a willingness to go anywhere and try anything that enabled her to re-affirm her superiority complex and support her independent lifestyle. <br />
<span style="font-weight:bold"><br />
Motivations: “Don’t mess with my business and I won’t utterly ruin yours.” </span>Fiercely protective of her independence, Allorian believes herself superior to everyone she meets. She wants nothing more than to be free to go where she wants and do whatever she wishes at all times. Yasmeen pays her a monthly stipend for information and provides her with a high-paying fence for her more notable stolen items. Allorian does not seek fame or glory, content to demonstrate to herself alone her ability to take other people’s prized possessions. If someone values something highly enough, Allorian will eventually try to steal it.</p>

<p>She is currently seeking any and all information leading to discovering the current whereabouts of the legendary Sapphire of Shattered Memory (or any relevant powerful item from your campaign). </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Where Likely Encountered: “Come here often? Me neither.” </span>In any pub, inn’s common room, or public gathering place such as the Great Bazaar. Allorian isn’t shy. She often studies people openly and makes comments on their appearance loud enough for them to hear. Allorian is always protected by a Mind Blank spell and an enhanced Ring of Non-Detection to make her seem Chaotic Good. Therefore, it is impossible to find her when she doesn’t want to be found. However, she always turns up eventually.<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold"><br />
One Adventure Tie In or Plot Hook: “We have mutual friends, and perhaps we could help each other out someday.” </span>Due to her excellent connections, Allorian knows something about the PC’s that they don’t want someone else to know. Example: a fight in an alley that the Harmonium are curious about. She smirks and approaches the PC’s at their table in a pub, pointing out that they look “terribly familiar—as in ‘terrible’ if the Harmonium find them out.” She isn’t looking for a payoff or a bribe; she’s just making conversation and, hopefully, future connections. </p>

<p>Bardic Knowledge or Knowledge (Local) reveals Allorian’s friends in high places, (hopefully) dissuading the PC’s from strong-arming her into silence. Instead, she offers to help the PC’s find what they’re seeking, simply because she is intrigued and bored. Allorian is a good source of odd information for PC’s, but her words come at a steep price. “Tell me a secret, and I’ll tell you where to find the Hag you seek.” She accepts no coin for sharing her knowledge; instead, she wants to know your deep, dark mysteries—the more shameful and embarrassing, the more they are worth to her. </p>

<p>Allorian knows almost everyone in Sigil, although she calls no one her friend.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>"We transcend gender. We transcend race. We transcend social and economic class. We care only what you can do to help us bring about a perfect Multiverse... a unified and harmonious Multiverse."</p>

<p>-Motivational Speaker for the Harmonium*</p>

<p>Name: Kilzebul, The Harmony-seeking Devil, The Good Fiend of Fortitude<br />
Race: Baatezu (Cernabraxu)** <br />
Gender: Female<br />
Alignment: Lawful Evil<br />
Class: Expert 1 <br />
Faction: Harmonium (Initiate) </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Background</span>: To write down the entire history of a fiend would take… well… long. Anyway, Kilzebul has always shown interest in military organization. That’s why they made her join the clerk’s ‘path’ in the first place, where she made a rather rapid carrier (in a devils’ sense of course). When the Harmonium came to be known as a planar faction she has just been promoted to Cernabraxu status, and was set on the new organization. She worked as a researcher for mortal military organizations and mainly her work was not that of a genius strategist but to keep the devils up to date with recent developments among mortal warfare technology (which, of course, includes strategy). Her task was to provide information about almost everything about the Harmonium: The Faction’s goals, organization, belief, favourite colour etc. </p>

<p>Kilzebul took delight in her new position of power as the head of a team of soon a dozen researchers, but she also noticed that things had changed, that expectations on her seemed systematically exceed her possibilities and that she was now in the midst of Baatorian scheming and plotting. Back when she has still been an Abraxu she could work on her projects and all was well. Now, she had to pay attention to inanities; the mood of her superiors, the ambitions of her underlings, the etiquette of the Ministry, and so forth. This didn’t only get on her nerves terribly – she also saw it as a major weakness: Everyone is on a constant struggle to improve its own situation to an extent were the greater cause would be ignored. No wonder why they couldn’t win the Blood War, when they’re behaving like their chaotic counterparts!</p>

<p>At the same time fortune has offered her a perfect alternative: The very organization she has been assigned to investigate, spy on seemed to exhibit many of the virtues of her race while also promoting what it lacked the most: harmony. Kilzebul’s frustration and disappointment about the weakness of her race grew strong over the time up to a point that she decided to join the Harmonium and leave Baator forever (after leaving a formal letter of resignation that would be found later on, of course).</p>

<p>So, one day the rebellious fiend simply walked through the gates of Courage. How exactly she made it from Baator to the Gate Town to Arcadia is a dark and Kilzebul completely refuses to comment on this matter. The local townsfolk were in a minor uproar this day, naturally assuming ill intentions. The bashers were quite irritated when she demanded to be brought to the Harmonium headquarters. After a short debate with some middle-ranking officer she revealed the cause of her appearance. The officer, not knowing what to do with the fiend, decided to call for the high-ups. Several minutes passed that seemed an eternity and then a whole lot of Harmonium guards appeared, with no one but the Factol herself on their coat-tails, demanding what the devil had demanded just before. Without a further word, the lot went down Ascension to The Accord leaving behind the speechless bystanders.</p>

<p>Whatever they discussed it took some time for the fiend has not been for four days after the incident. The chant quickly spread to all three corners of the Multiverse. Among the Harmonium there was a concern about the fiend’s intentions, about the possible consequences if she would really be allowed to join the Faction, the wrath of the Baatezu and generally everything. In the end the devil’s request was granted. Late in the evening of the fourth day after Kilzebul’s appearance in Courage an official statement was given that the Harmonium welcomes the Baatorian newcomer and that they are grateful to be given the chance to prove that the Harmonium’s ideals truly transcend every social or racial boundary. Furthermore, the initiate would soon be off to an assignment in the former Gate Town of Fortitude. Beyond this, the official propaganda is eager to keep low profile, which is a source of speculation itself.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Kilzebul’s quest</span>: Like any other potential member, Kilzebul has to prove that she is worth it and truly affirmates the Faction’s believe. In her case the high-ups have been very creative and divided the quest according to the Rule of Three, each part symbolizing a virtue of Harmonium ideals, or so the chant goes. These parts are: Courage, Charity and, of course, Harmony. The first was solved by her breaking with the Baatezu, the third will be a trial of 44 months of living among the denizens of the Upper Planes in peace and harmony, though the current one, spreading charity in a fallen Gate Town, is maybe the hardest one for a fiend that never felt a single bit compassion for another living being.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Appearance</span>: As the Baatezu hierarchy does not leave much room for individuality, Kilzebul pretty much looks like any other Cernabraxu. To mortals, they all look alike if they haven’t got their horns cracked or something. This of course doesn’t make her appearance more comfortable to her new ‘friends’.<br />
Kilzebul exchanged her old Ministry robes for a white-blue Harmonium outfit, which makes an ugly contrast to her otherwise greyish skin. She doesn’t wear any adornment, neither weapons nor a single magical item for everything had to be left back in Baator when she deserted.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Personality</span>: Kilzebul is usually quiet and calm, even relaxed when she is left alone in her normal work. But her current task is actually making her uncomfortable and she has been acting nervous lately. However, Kilzebul will not let her guard down and tries to adapt to the circumstances. She has little trouble forcing herself to be polite, but is generally indifferent towards other people. Her liking of orderly behaviour, competence and cooperation has not diminished in the new environment which could have been potentially frustrating to the fiend. </p>

<p>Despite that Kilzebul is still a devil and evil for this part. She will, for example, not lightly accept resistance to the Faction’s goals where other Harmonium members might be more tolerant. Also, the ‘soft’ policy of the current Factol might come at odds with Kilzebul’s point of view. But then, she isn’t the only evil having been attracted to the Harmonium.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Motivations</span>: Her motivations are honest so far. Of course Kilzebul has plans for the future. She chose the Harmonium not because they are so chivalrous but because they are fostering order, cooperation and (naturally) harmony, things that she has seen the Baatezu lacking of. Basically she wants to remain in her old job as an expert of military organization and tactics and thinks her knowledge would contribute greatly to the Harmonium’s cause of further promoting their ideal of society. Yet this might be a source of future trouble when her ideas about ‘promoting’ clash with those of (some of) her fellows.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Other important facts</span>: The Baatezu have already noticed Kilzebuls betrayal and they are outraged. Such insolence is nothing the proud race would easily overlook and they will soon try and erase her from existence – after they settled out under which responsibility her case falls, that is. The Harmonium, of course, is not ignorant of this danger and the powers know what rides the high-ups to let this happen. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Where likely encountered</span>: Fortitude or at the Harmonium headquarters in Courage, probably Arcadia if she’ll get her quest before the Baatezu’s fangs reach her.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">One adventure tie in or plot hook</span>: Kilzebul’s current efforts to spread charity in the former Gate-Town Fortitude are clumsy, and that’s putting it mildly. See, as a devil having been in the service of the Ministry of Research for millennia, many things were required from her to survive and prosper; ‘charity’ was not. Despite her intelligence, Kilzebul has not yet find a way to properly deal with the new task. Instead she tries to make up for her lack of experience and devotion by generally being helpful to anyone who comes to her, giving away food to seemingly poor beggars and so on. This sometimes creates ridiculous or awkward situations and she is gloatingly called “The Good Fiend of Fortitude” by those canny or barmy enough to take advantage of Kilzebul’s quest.</p>

<p>The devil is well aware that her grasp on charity is a bit… odd. She will nevertheless not lower her guard in front of her Harmonium companions. Rather she will most likely ask travellers from the outside that seem trustworthy and competent in this matter for advice. After all Fortitude is not a save place for a devil that betrayed its race.</p>

<p>**Baatezu caste currently in development to fill in the hellish bureaucracy. It will definitely be stronger than the current CR3 devil I thought out elsewhere to not to fall to the first breath of a Baatorian assassin.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Author's Note:</span> <span style="font-style:italic">My mind is a very strange place.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold"><span style="color:darkblue"><span style="font-size:20px">Jack Hammer McStoneface, Private Eye</span></span></span><br />
<span style="font-style:italic">Male Stone Genasi, CN Barbarian 8</span></p>

<p><div style="text-align:center"><span style="font-size:18px">"Bullets were falling like rain. And I was getting soaked."</span><span style="font-style:italic"><br />
-Jack Hammer McStoneface in <span style="text-decoration:underline">It Always Rains</span>, Chapter 8</span></div></p>

<p>If you turn left at Dead Berk Boulevard, step backwards into the first alleyway you see, and successfully whistle any well-known tune in reverse, you <span style="font-style:italic">might</span> just end up in The Tiefling's Tale, Sigil's premier fiction bookshop. Here you'll find every series imaginable--from the bloodsoaked stories of Drizzle Durden, the dual katana wielding half-demon half-dark-elf (with wings!) tortured by a mysterious past, to Doctor Von Grimskull's tales of two-fisted justice and steam-powered zombies (to quote the titular character: "The Doctor is in... <span style="font-style:italic">vincible!</span>")</p>

<p>But you won't find a single copy of one of the most popular series, Jack Hammer McStoneface. In fact--if you even ask--you'll probably be lead straight out the door.</p>

<p>No one there wants to talk about how all the McStoneface books recently disappeared. They don't want to discuss the black cloud that's been floating over block after block of the Hive. They <span style="font-style:italic">certainly</span> don't want to speak about the constant rain, or the way that everything under the cloud is temporarily drained of color, or the people who are reportedly disappearing and reappearing as completely barmy, convinced they're characters from the McStoneface books. And there is no way in the Nine Hells that they will even approach the subject of who may lie at the center of that cloud--Jack Hammer McStoneface himself, acting out the last chapters of the unfinished finale.</p>

<p><div style="text-align:center"><span style="font-size:18px">"I was tied to a chair. Benito had a tire-iron. Pissing him off was the smart thing to do."</span>*<br />
<span style="font-style:italic">-Jack Hammer McStoneface in <span style="text-decoration:underline">It Always Rains</span>, Chapter 12</span></div></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">The Dark of It:</span></span> A block-wide rain-cloud is sweeping over the Hive, draining anything under it of color and temporarily turning people and objects into characters and props from the last unfinished Jack Hammer McStoneface novel. Anyone caught beneath the perpetual rain immediately becomes a black-and-white caricture from a hard-boiled detective novel (think Sin City or Max Payne). Armor turns into pin-stripe suits, bows and arows into guns and bullets, cross-bows into shotguns, and swords into clubs, lead-pipes, and pipe-wrenches. This change is purely cosmetic; all objects and related feats function exactly the same under the cloud. Characters must make a Will save (DC: 20) or be caught up in their new role, acting out their part in the novel for as long as they remain underneath the cloud. Groups of muggers turn into hired goons sent by Benito (the villain of the novel), merchants turn into club-owners, and adventurers into beat cops or hard-bitten detectives on the killer's trail.</p>

<p>At the center of this cloud is Jack Hammer McStoneface himself--the titular character of the McStoneface novels. Unaware of the fact that he's a fictitious character, he now acts out the sordid tale contained in the last unfinished McStoneface book, <span style="text-decoration:underline">It Always Rains</span>, pursuing the crime-lord Benito and his accomplice, the Dame-Killer. </p>

<p>Killing Jack is nigh-impossible; he has tons of DR and an outrageous sack of hitpoints. To beat him without violence, players must either convince the original author (a drunken dust mephit) to finish the series or end the story themselves and act it out with Jack. Benito needs to be beaten, the killer found, and the dame (whoever she may be) saved. Jack will usually die at the completion of the story in a blaze of glory. So long as Jack either dies or ties up the loose-ends, the rain-cloud dissolves and the effect ends.</p>

<p>Wherever Jack goes, a cheesy narrator (Jack himself) can be heard, narrating the action in standard noir-style. Only creatures who made their initial save can hear it; those wrapped up in the story can't.</p>

<p>The Lady of Pain and the Dabus ignore Jack. They are immune to the effects of the rain-cloud, and his activities do not threaten the city as a whole.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">Appearance:</span></span> Jack isn't built like a brickhouse--brickhouses are built like Jack. A slab of rock roughly fashioned into the semblance of a 7 foot tall man, with fists like sledgehammers and a lit stogie always clutched between his clenched teeth. He wears a black trench-coat and matching hat, and is always accompanied by Sally and her sister, Mary--his pet-names for a colt .45 and pipe-wrench (sling with pouch of of +1 stones and +1 club).</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">Personality:</span></span> Jack is a consummate detective novel hard-ass anti-hero; dark, vicious, brutal, but ultimately out to beat the killer into a bloody pulp and save the day. Killing Benito and catching the dame-killer (and saving the dame) are the only concerns he has; he is completely unaware that he's a fictional character, and any attempt to explain this to him is probably just going to result in a lot of confusion (and eventually some fists). He'll accept help in his quest, but only begrudgingly.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">Adventure Hook:</span></span> People in the Hive are throwing a *fit*. Some stormy raincloud keeps sweeping by and disrupting everybody's day, turning everything topsy turvy; by the time the cloud leaves, no one remembers what happened or why they're missing teeth and sporting fresh bruises (or how they ended up in this ditch). The people in the Hive want an end put to this madness, and some of them may be willing to pay.</p>

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Author's Note:</span> <span style="font-style:italic">"Procrastination, thy name is ME!"</span>  This NPC was taken from a pre-Faction War Sigil setting IMC.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Name:</span> Lania Mist Weaver <br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Race:</span> Tiefling<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Gender:</span> Female<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Alignment:</span> CE<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Class:</span> Rouge 5<br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Faction:</span> Society of Sensation (“Sensate”)</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Description: </span>If ever the githyanki were to have a spokes model in Sigil, Lania would be ideal for the position; that is, if it weren’t for the fact she’s not a gith.  Standing at five foot, five inches, she is slightly taller than the average human female.  Curvaceous legs both long and lithe combined with the perfect choice of attire that both accentuates and conceals her form; she is no stranger to the public forum where she fancies herself a model (of sorts).  Her straight blonde hair hangs waist length and she often wears it pulled back into a ponytail.  Her somber yet alluring eyes glisten of an amber hue and her thin lips are often drawn tight in what appears to be a pout.  Lania’s skin tone is slightly pale yellow with golden accents but her color choice in clothes always complements her complexion.  Perhaps her most prominent feature is her apparent lack of a nose (<span style="font-style:italic">a closer inspection would reveal slits-Author.</span>).  Whenever she is nervous or fearful for her well being, she will emit a dense fog (as a free action) which she uses to make her hasty retreat.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Personality:</span> Aside from her diva-like attitude, she is very cunning and equally as dangerous.  “Me first!” would be a fitting summary of her perception of life and her surroundings.  She has kleptomaniac tendencies and often desires items that cannot readily be replaced nor easily concealed.  Her exposure to the limelight affords her a plethora of clueless to bob and her tastes range wildly from a namer’s initiate pin to a factol’s favorite robe or a faction’s bejeweled insignia.  Lania has a very high appeal among humans and half-elves based on her appearance.  She therefore tends to keep her tiefling heritage concealed by portraying an exotic mix of both races from some distant prime plane; that is until her level of interest wanes.   Trying to anticipate her actions is as difficult as attempting to hold a rainbow or drink sunshine.  One would do well to steer clear of any plots or plans involving her as her plans have often shifted in the midst of their execution.   </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Short History:</span>  Lania’s childhood is a mystery to her as well as those close to her (a small group indeed), but she is a classic example of how far desire and belief can take a blood.  You see, she only remembers observing how other members of her race are treated and generally regarded within the city.  She uses that memory as a motivation for redemption.  No one person can pin point when she stepped into the Civic Festhall, but the beliefs and practices of the Sensates came to her like a second nature.  The philosophies seemed to have been based on her standard practice up to that point, so obtaining membership was definitely not a challenge.  In fact, she is such a frequent visitor to the Sensate Sensorium that she has gained ownership of three private rooms.  It’s whispered around the Festhall that she is lobbying for the title of Factol, but this couldn’t be further from the truth behind her motivations.  She often moonlights as a cross trader conducting her deals during her bi-weekly or monthly visits to the Styx Oarsman.  No one suspects her (at least not the high-ups) as members of her entourage are equally as shady. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">The Dark:</span> Lania has become consumed with the prospect of “capturing” the philosophies of each faction for her own use.  She has begun to nurse the belief that each faction has one element of truth which must be isolated, experienced and combined with the other 14 parts to be realized as the Universal Truth.  Since most factions (if not all) don’t take kindly to a berk rifling through their private records, her safety has been threatened more often than naught.  She has been able to target a few gullible, low-level, lust-driven males in various factions for “private consultation;” after all, there are rubes aplenty in Sigil.  A sod may often find himself penned in the dead book after his usefulness has waned.  Her latest caper allowed her to spirit away a speaker’s key from Factotum Jaye of the Sign of One.  She utilized an underground den of thieves to execute the caper while she kept him blissfully preoccupied during his journey from Glorium to Sylvania.  He doesn’t suspect her but he can’t readily admit to being in her company during this business trip either.<br />
   <br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Motivations: </span>Driven by the acquisition of whatever catches her whim, she can be equally dangerous as an individual or through her many connections throughout the city.  She longs to elevate to the next level with her acquired information and become a power in her own right.  She then will make all other persecuting races suffer for the injustices her has had to suffer.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Where Likely Encountered:</span> She is most often found wandering within the confines of the Civic Festhall.  There are, however, those instances where she may be encountered at the Styx Oarsmen or in the throngs of the Night Bazaar; in both of those instances, she will be in the company of her entourage consisting of an ogre barbarian, two androgynous humanoid wizards, an alu-demon confidante and a tiefling thief as her personal attendant.  </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Other Important Facts:</span> Lania, although driven by desire of things in the possession of others, will not place herself in a situation where she stands to be harmed in any way.  One might say that her desire for self-preservation outweighs the need to acquire.  Of late, she has created and nurtured the simultaneous rumors that she is a Merkant selling sensate secrets and that she’s a guvner planted in the society as a spy.  No one would dare approach her directly as she has managed to acquire dirt on all high-ups with which she has dealings; they have to grudgingly wait for her to play her hand.  Over all, no one suspects what’s she’s really up to. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Plot Hook:</span> There is a growing tension in the air of Sigil due to each faction attempting to emerge as the premiere faction and the prospect of items, secrets and members turning up missing are disturbing to say the least.  Perhaps the adventuring party knows of the underground thieves den, or maybe they’ve witnessed an isolated situation implicating Lania, or maybe they possess an item she craves or perhaps they’ve been hired to protect the interests of a particular faction . . . (<span style="font-style:italic">forgive the run on sentence, but the “juices” were flowing-Author).</span></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Sammadre (male bariaur expert 5, free league)</p>

<p>Sammadre is often referred to as "the booted bariaur", as he runs a stall in the Great Bazaar by the same name. Sammadre looks much like any chocolate-brown furred bariaur indep, with swirling tattoos and a small shaven ouroboros in his flank. He keeps his head shaved and has a full, bushy beard. Most notably, though, is that he wears two pairs of boots. Whenever he's asked about it, he simply says they're for comfort.</p>

<p>Sammadre is known as one of the best bootmakers in the Cage, and many an adventurer have gone to his stall after some mishap on the planes necessitates new footwear. He's generally avoided by other bariaur, as they view his habits as a potentially contagious form of madness. His boots aren't the only thing that make him unusual - he hasn't left the city in many years and seems to lack the typical bariaur wanderlust. Sammadre is content to live in Sigil, making and repairing boots for people.</p>

<p>On occasion, somebody will come to the Booted Bariaur asking for sandals or soft silken slippers. Sammadre feels very strongly about the comfort and utility of a good pair of boots, and does his best to convince his prospective customer that boots are much better than whatever else they thought they'd like to wear.</p>

<p>Although nobody's been able to figure out why Sammadre likes boots so much, the biggest mystery about him is how he keeps them on.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Well, since you asked nicely. . .</p>

<p>It was really hard to choose just five, because apparantly there are some pretty talented writers hiding out there. I finally did narrow it down, though, and the 5 that appealed most to me as good Planescape NPCs were, in no particular order: (Author name -- NPC name)</p>

<p>One of One -- Ashanon<br />
Defier -- Aron the Caged<br />
Weishan -- Box<br />
Kay -- Kilzebul<br />
The Great Hippo -- Jack Hammer McStoneface, Private Eye</p>

<p>I've sent the list out to a few judges and when I've heard back from most of them, we'll find out who the final winner is. Congrats to the finalists, and thanks to everyone. I think we got some very interesting material out of this, and I encourage everyone who submitted an NPC to submit them to the site as a proper article.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I've already heard back from 2 judges, and so far its really close. The leader is only ahead by 4 points, and even the one with the lowest score is only 7 points behind the leader. As soon as I finish typing this message, I will be driving 2 hours south to retrieve the box set from my home. I'll be there for the weekend, then when I get back I'll see how many more judges I've heard from, tally the scores, and post a winner.</p>

<p>Have a good weekend everyone</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>If I can have everyone's attention please, we have a winner!</p>

<p>I heard back from enough of the judges from PW, and had a GM friend of mine who knows PS add another set of scores just so there were at least four sets of scores. I wasn't going to post the exact scores, but I just want everyone to see how close this came out to be:</p>

<p>The four criteria were:<br />
A) How interesting the character was<br />
B) How well they could mesh with existing NPCs and plots<br />
C) How easily a DM could adapt them to their own campaign<br />
D) How thematically appropriate they are to the PS multiverse</p>

<p>Each criteria was ranked on a 1-10 score by each judge. The highest score possible would be a 160 with perfect tens in every category from every judge. Here are the results, with the judges remaining anonymous to avoid yuggoloth assassination attempts:</p>

<p>Ashanon, by One of One<br />
A) 6, 4, 7, 9<br />
B) 8, 6, 7, 7<br />
C) 9, 9, 8, 7<br />
D) 7, 8, 8, 8<br />
Total Score: 118/160</p>

<p>Aron the Caged, by Defier<br />
A) 7, 8, 6, 7<br />
B) 6, 9, 7, 8<br />
C) 9, 8, 7, 8<br />
D) 8, 9, 9, 8<br />
Total Score: 124/160</p>

<p>Box, by Weishan<br />
A) 9, 6, 10, 8<br />
B) 5, 7, 5, 6<br />
C) 8, 8, 7, 6<br />
D) 7, 8, 9, 10<br />
Total Score: 119/160</p>

<p>Kilzebul, by Kay<br />
A) 5, 9, 7, 6<br />
B) 8, 8, 6, 7<br />
C) 7, 8, 7, 8<br />
D) 8, 9, 9, 8<br />
Total Score: 120/160</p>

<p>Jack Hammer McStoneface, Private Eye, by The Great Hippo<br />
A) 6, 10, 10, 8<br />
B) 5, 8, 7, 7<br />
C) 4, 7, 8, 7<br />
D) 10, 10, 9, 10<br />
Total Score: 126/160</p>

<p>Meaning that our grand prize winner is The Great Hippo, by a margin of only 2 points! Congrats Hippo! Please PM me with your address and such and we'll work out how to get the Hellbound Box Set into your deserving hands!</p>

<p>Thanks again for playing everyone. Maybe if I can get my hands on some more cheap PS materials we can do this again sometime. And please, if my math has gone funny at some point, please point it out. I double checked the figures because they were so close, but I'm no Modron and errors are possible.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I <span style="font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">seriously</span></span> cannot believe you people let someone with the name "Jack Hammer McStoneface" win.</p>

<p>HOW.</p>

<p>Still, I immensely appreciated this opportunity. I'd like to take this chance to thank everyone responsible; PW for hosting the contest, Hymneth for shanking some poor old librarian for the cheap Hellbound set (I WOULD HAVE SHANKED HER TWICE), everyone for submitting their own interesting characters, the various voices in my head (they wanted me to call him "Jackhammer McPeck Hammerslab", but I managed to talk them down), and all the judges who scored the pieces.</p>

<p>Except the one who gave me a four.</p>

         <p>Now now, we'll have none of that. I still remember who that judge is, and if they disappear off the face of the boards, I <span style="font-style:italic">will</span> look into it.  <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/cool.png" title="Cool" alt="Cool" class="smiley-content"/> </p>

<p>On a more serious note, seriously, congratulations, and its a great centerpiece to build a collection around. I have almost the whole set, and I have to say that Hellbound was one of the more difficult pieces for me to find.</p>

<p>Oh, and looking through the box, here's exactly what's inside (there are a few bonuses, it looks like):</p>

<p>The box (a little squished in the middle, but good shape. Still has the $12.99 pricetag on it)<br />
The Bargain comic book, with ridiculously awesome art by Tony Diterlizzi<br />
The Dark of the War, an 80 page DMs guide<br />
The Chant of the War, a 31 page Player's guide<br />
War Games, a 96 page adventure book with three of my personal favorite adventures<br />
Visions of War, a 23 page book containing only full page illustrations and maps of various scenes from War Games<br />
(And here's the list of extra stuff that was in the box)<br />
The Planescape Conspectus, a list of all published Planescape products as of 1996, with an interesting full sized poster map of the Outer Planes<br />
A flier to subscribe to Dungeon or Dragon magazines from 1996<br />
A flier to join the RPGA network from 1995<br />
And for some reason, a copy of the Conan the Savage comic book #1 from 1995 that somebody felt needed to be stored in this box</p>

<p>I can't say that the name of the character is over-the-top, if anything, I think it's actually suitable for an <span style="font-style:italic">earth genasi</span> character. That being said, personally I find the mention of those "advanced" weapons too much, it just doesn't fit the theme, if you ask me. </p>

<p>The idea of how the character is conjured up and how he "interacts" with his environment is neat though. <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/smile.png" title="Smiling" alt="Smiling" class="smiley-content"/></p>

         <p>One last update for this thread: Action finally won out over laziness and I have mailed out the prize. I've been informed that it has arrived at the intended destination intact, so everything is peachy in the world.</p>

<p>If I ever get my hands on some more cheap PS stuff (and it'll happen again eventually) we'll have to do something like this again. Thanks for all the contributions and help in getting this thing up and running.</p>
