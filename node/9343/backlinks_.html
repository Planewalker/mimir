</div> <p>Finally got a game of Urban Planescape up and running, we had our first session last night. Thought I'd keep a mini blog of sorts....</p>

<p>To begin with, the players are LAPD vice squad cops, having just scored a massive case, arresting one of the most notorious criminals of the LA underworld. its 1st October 2001, Earth.</p>

<p>The Players<br />
Ben Conard - Surperb invesitgator, lost his voice to a bullet last year<br />
Yoshi Okinawa - Squads forensics tech and lab go between, loves extreme sports<br />
Conor Finally - a rough and tumble cop, several conduct charges against him<br />
Ryan Simmons - cyphers and cryptology expert, very OCD with learning<br />
Jason Stone - Ex US army, squads go between with tactical and SWAT<br />
Hector Chico Remario - Sqauds face and undercover specialist, loves parties</p>

<p>October 1st 2001, its 4am, the squad have just dragged Juan Rodrigrez back to the station house. The evidence they got at his mansion will be enough to to send him down for 2 life times, and theres no way his lawyers can get him out of this one. But there was more. The bastard had masses of paperwork, airport layouts, contact numbers, even a couple of god damn traning camp pictures. Seems he was a major player in 9/11, less than a month ago.</p>

<p>A few hours pass and the squad are getting no where with him, even Captain Ferdinand cant break the guy. And now two FBI have just walked in and taken the case. Captain says to go let off some steam, and gives the squad the next mormning off, tellin g them to be at the station house at  noon.</p>

<p>The squad deciede to go and celebrate their score. Someone suggests O'Sullavans, so they head there. The place is pretty empty. Ryan quickly becomes drunk, unable to hold is drink, the rest have a good time. Ben walks his superbike back home, too drunk to drive. Chico makes sure Ryan gets home safely is his drunken state.</p>

<p>In the morning, most get to the station just before 12, though Ryan is there by 10am, writing out the case file from memory that the FBI and CIA have taken. Stone gets in about the same time and spends some time at the firing range. At 12, the Captain introduces them to Agent Hislop, of the CIA. He explains to them that their squad is getting a transfer to a forgein city. He doesnt explain much at all, its all classified. They have 3 days to tie up any lose ends before going on a 6 month transfer abaord. Though he wont tell them where exactly, he likens it to chicago weather wise. </p>

<p>The next couple of days, the squad splits up, tieing up lose ends and packing, some lettiong out there own apparentsd, others just putting their gear into storage. they return to the station house at 9am on Thrusday 4th October. Captain Ferdinand has a quick chat with them, wishing them the best, and sorry he cant tell them more. Agent Hislop is waiting out front with two un marked cars. He says he will take them to their departure location. Again, not really giving much  away. Driving through LA, they quickly notice they are not heading near any major airport, or the ports. Stone intimidates his driver into telling them just an address. Chico recognizes it as a small no mans land inbetween two rivial gangs in one of the worse areas of LA. </p>

<p>Getting there, they pull up outside a burn out tenament block, a few homelss here and there, a small group of teenage street thugs. Many of the group realise that most are uncover operatives. They make their way into and up the block, to the 9th floor. Behind a locked door is an emntpy old apartment, with just a begger sitting wrapped in a blanket. Msot fo the squad by this time dont beleive what is happening and kepe making remarks about canid camera etc. Saying such to the bum, he says that its his slot on the rotta. Agent Hislop does explain a little, saying that they are to expect the unexpected, gives them new credit cards (from Valor banking) and new moblie phones as their old ones wont work. Asking where they are going, his points to the bathroom. Stone being stone, goes "really", then goes and takes a piss in their beofre coming back out to laughs all round at this point. Hislop then takes out a old spanish coin (1500's) and activates the portal. The entire squad is shocked, but do go through.</p>

<p>They appear in a very nice, upmarket house, maybe from belevery hills?  Siutting on one of the nice white leather sofa's is Detective Neil Edos, who they were told would be meeting them when they got to the city. After alot of disbleive and talk of worm holes (they came out of one of the windows), Neil drives them out of the Lays Ward, onto the interward. Its a 45 minute drive to Mid Clerks and Clerks station, whedre their old Captain Peters is waiting for them. edos doesnt explain much, the Captain has told  him not too, but he knows the city quite well. Ryan looks over his current case file, but cant read it. </p>

<p>Arriving at Clerks Station, they park in the huge parking garge and take the elevator up to one of the mid levels of the building. When the doors open, Detective McKall is waiting outside. Unfortunately, Chico has a abject fear of Reptiles, and being confronted by a Lizardmen wearing a uite, he snaps and tries to pull his sidearm against the guy, however, stone is quker and manages to disarm the terrefied Chico. The rest of the group claims him down, McKall apoligizes and takes a different elevator. Edos, quickly shuffles them to the Captain Office. Captain Peters, the squads former Captain back in LA 8 months ago is waiting with his office door open. He explains the basic situation to the squad, the very basics of Sigil. He also gets the Whisky out for them. Also briefs them on their new case and gives them a package each, containing apartment keys, and a map of sigil.  He gives them 4 days leave to get use to the city and to find their feet.</p>

<p>they deciede that they need a drink. Talking with Edos on the way in, Stone suggests Elans, which the Captain says is a good place, so the squad head down there. Walking out of Cerks Station through the front doors, the sqaud walk past nm uersous other Sigil PD officers, a lot of which arent human. Ryan sees the goblin on the front desk and ask if he can come and talk to him after his shift as he wants to know about goblins (he has a complete lack of social skills). Getting to the bar, Chico orders the strongest drink they have, and is given an Abyssal Screamer. It knocks him on the floor and when he stands up again, he is totally pissed. So he asks for another, but is a one drink maximum of those. Stone tries one too. He gets a surround sound vision of hell, then shrugs and gets another drink,. All have Firewine, which they seems to like. Ben has had a headache since they arrived. Suddenly it goes, and his speaks to Yoshi "Ah thats better" which shes just stares in disblieve aty her mute friend....</p>

<p>.....and thats where we left the first session. not exaclty exiciting stuff, but it was good fun, lots of laughs. Thankfully, the group have all (apart from Yoshi) have plaed planescape before and played up the clueless roel erally well. AS an aside, this game is actually using gurps 4e rules. Next sessino is next wednesday.</p>

         <p>Well, guess i better start typing then <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/smile.png" title="Smiling" alt="Smiling" class="smiley-content"/></p>

<p>First up, the 4 days leave in Sigil.<br />
________<br />
Yoshi quickly grows bored at her new apartment and wants to blow of some stream, and wnats to go climbing or biking or hiking, just something she enjoys. She calls Captain Peters, who arranges her to go on a 'training' exercise with a police survival expert. Later that day she meets with Rob Jamison, an Elf. He meets her at Clerks station, then they head off on the subway to one of the many railway stations which lead out of sigil. they appear in endless cornfields and rolling hills. He explains this is the outlands. The train ride takes a few hours, but they are eventually dropped off at a small, but very upmarket station, surrounded by a few luxury buildings. The cornfields have given way to green rolling hills, dotted with some corps of trees. Rob explains this is ZK's, letters mirrored at the top of the single large high rise hotel. They head over to a small builidings, a garge, where he rents out a Jeep. throwing the gear in the back they set off. An hours drive has then entering a thick wood. It gets darker the deeper they go in. A light appears down the track some way, reaching it they leave the forest and appear on endless savannahs under a high, bright sun. Rob introduces the land as Kirigala of the Beastlands.</p>

<p>They spend the the better part of half a day driving across the savannahs and grasslands, at one point a pride of lions running with the jeep. Eventually they approach an outcropping of rocks. Kicking the four wheel drive up a notch, Rob drives the jeep into a cave in the rocks, and hits the headlights on as its very dark. It takes about 20 minutes slow drive through the cave, but they evetually exit it once again. They appear on a dusty red rock ledge, overlooking a ravine that makes the grand canyon seem tiny. Its dusk...or dawn, the light on every horzian. Rob introdcues this as Brux of the Beastlands. Parking the jeep a little further along the ledge, they get they're gear and plan their route, descending into the ravine, to its bottom to the river, ride its white waters, they climb back up and across back to the jeep within 2 days. Its a tough 2 days, but Yoshi is an expert climber herself, and they make it in good time. During one break, rob explains the 'geography' of the lands they passed through as Yoshi is a little lost, likening planes to planets and layers to continents. </p>

<p>Yoshi was hoping to drive part of the way back through Kirigala, but shes too tried.</p>

<p>_____<br />
Ryan too quickly gets bored of his apartment  and wants to learn more about these new peoples and places, and wants to learn to read Elvish as a prority as laws and case files are often written in comon (english) and elvish as it is a very detailed language useful for such things (Captain Peters likens it to French being used for legal documentation back on Earth), and he is also very curious about magic. Captain Peters arranges for Ryan to go study both Elvish and magic at The Castle in Ladys Ward, Sigil Police HQ. Giving him directions, Ryan takes the subway, whihc takes a little while, but eventually reaches The Castle, which has a subway station of the same name. The Castle is a large, very modern buildings, rectangular in shpae with a centural court yard, tho upper walkways cris cross it. Everyone enters The Castle through its lowest teir, The Barracks. The uniforms of the Ladys Ward work from here, as the ward doesnt have a sperate station of its own. however, Ryan is quickly directed to the Elevators and up to The Armoury, the mid teirs of The Castle. There he meets Raleour Ordus, one of the Sigil PD's magical trainers. through Raleour begins with the standard introdcuary texts, Ryan quickly gets bored and impatient and asks if he may study it at his own pace. Raleour accepts this. Over the next few days, Ryan comes and goes from The Castle, but quickly masters both Elvish and the basic principles of magic.</p>

<p>______<br />
Ben quickly drops his gear off and goes back to clerks Station to 'talk' with Captain Peters. The Captain is very surprised at Ben's ability to communiticate telepathicly. The Captain however doesnt know much about psionics, so he suggests a professor at The Univeristy of Sigil, Kainus Odel, a member of the Fratunity of Order. Ben also gets directs to a bike hired shop nearby. He first picks up a bike, a Yasi superbike, then proceeds to head to the university. finding professor Odel, he has a long conversation about Earth, magic and psionics and about the professor's race, the Githerzi. The professor suspectst that Earth is a dead magic world, where no magic or psionics will function and warns Ben that returning to Earth would most likely lead to the surpression of his newfound abilities. </p>

<p>After that, Ben spends the next few days getting to know the streets of Sigil better, mostly those in Clerks ward and discovering his new found talents, and constantly refering to himself as a Jedi......<br />
________<br />
Chico takes some time to explore his new apartment, then around late evening heads out to find discover what the night life of Sigil is like. He finds the city to his liking, with plenty of bars in mid clerks, as it is a significant residentual area. Over the course of the next few nights, he expnds his travels. On the third night, he learns that High Corps has more upmarket bars and clubs and decides to check them out. He finds his one to one of the most famous clubs in High Corps and most of Sigil, Obsidian Dance. There he meets its owner, Janna de'Shar, a beatiful drow priestess of Elistraee, nicknamed the Obsidian Dancer. Chico being Chcio, over the course the night he seduces her (no slight achievment) and she also describes her god, Elistraee to him, which he seems to take a liking to.</p>

<p>The last night doesnt really compare, but he still enjoys himself and he has seemed to have made something of a reputation of himself amongs the clubers and bar hoppers of Clerks and Corp.<br />
________<br />
Finlly and Stone have been assigned to another case temporaily so havent seen the other 4 since leaving Elan's.</p>

<p>______<br />
That lot was handled at the start of the second session (yoshi's happen at home, as she is my girlfriend, hence slightly more detail as we had the time..)</p>

<p>I will post up what happened during the second session tomorrow morning,  as we have the 3rd sessnio tomorrow night....</p>

         <p>Hive 5th Tithing, 14386 of the Revelationary Era</p>

<p>Its 9am SS (Sigil Standard). Ryan, Yoshi, Ben and Chico get to Clerks Station and head to the Captains Office. Captain Peters gives them their new badges, and fills them on their new Case some more The evidence from LA that was linked to Sigl was a picture of a training camp group, one member was wearing a pendent (shaped like an Ankh), which matches a tatteo found on an attacker of a recetn homocide in Sigil. The Captain gives the autospy reports to Yoshi and tells her the bodies are in the Police wing of the Mortuary down in Low Hive, he warns the squad to be careful within the Hive. He gives the squad the keys to an unmarked car.</p>

<p>The case file has witness statments of the homocide incident, which took place at Madam Charlotte's, a small botheral down in Low Corps.The two main statements are from Charlotte Bell, the owner, plus a client, Eric Wyvern. The attacker with the tattoe was killed at the scene, along with 8 clients and 6 girls. 4 other attackers escaped.  The squa deicede to split up. Yoshi heads to the Mortuary, dropping off Chico at Madam's Charlotte's , the Corp ward is on the way. Ben and ryan head to the Sigil Uni on Bens bike, Ryan to use their extensive library to research the historical siginficance of the Ankh, while Ben goes back to professor Odel to dicuss the symbolism of the Ankh. </p>

<p>Coming off the interward ito Low Hive, or just The Hive as most poeple call it, Yoshi finds the roads littered with debry, she slowly makes her way to the Mortuary, a massive domed building. She parks the car (with worry and regret) and heads into the mortuary, its pastal green walls adn white tiles not making her feel any better about the place. Security direct her to the police wing, where she meets Harry Kaal, a techican. He takes her through the autospy reports some more and shows her the bodies. The bdies where all killed by semi automatic gn rounds, fired at close range, showing military training, all shots chest and head. She makes the realisation that some of the bodies where shot in the head after they were already dead.....after that, she returns to Clerks Station.</p>

<p>Chico arrives outside Madam Charlotte's a small 3 story building in Low Corps, fronted with wooden panaling and a small wooden patio. Though he is first refused entry, showing his badge they let him in. Speaking with a still very upset Charlotte Bell, she tells him what happen again - shouts then guns shots, eric put on his pants, then a man brust through the door, looked at her, then at Eric, said "The vessel is emptied" then tried to shoot Eric. Eric managed to throw a firebolt at the attacker, but it only slowed him down. eric grabbed for him, tjhey stuggled, then the attacker fell back through the dorrway, where one of huis companions acciendently shot him. With that, the attackers feld. Chico comforts Charlotte, asks about Eric Wyvern. He too then heads back to Clerks Station.........Later Chico described her as "A whore with a heart of gold"</p>

<p>Ryan quickly finds himself very happy being in such a library at Sigil Uni. He goes and loses himself in the books, and digs up soem information on Set, the ancient Eyptation god of destruction, who used the ankh alot, finds reference to Ragnorok and Sets destrcution. All the while he is also studies a magic tome on and off. When ryan leaves, he borrows 9 books from the library (the max), but only after calling first the general police line to get his Captains number, then speaking to his Captain for the library to give him clearnace (and membership) to take out the books. Tho he was going to go back to the station witj Ben, carry 9 books on the back of a motorbike doesnt work, so he gets the subway instead</p>

<p>Ben doesnt find prof Odel immediately, and is told he is giving a lecture. Ben sits in on the last bit of the lecture, on the corrpution of Sigil's Senate. Finishing up, Ben goes and talks to the prof and asks him whether he knows anything about the symbolism of the ankh and any hisotry is has as an iconic for groups. The prof doesnt know, but directs Ben to professor Frederic Lile, a specialist on symbolism. Metting with this professor Lile, Ben discovers that the ankh was usually associated with two paradoxical themes, death and protection. After some more chatting, ben heads back to he station.</p>

<p>Meeting back up again, the team discuss what they have found out so far. Its decided that yoshi and Ben will go and look at the dead attacker's most recent address, a flat in the spidewebs of the Hive, while Chico goes and talks to Eric Wyvern and ryan is off to get a very rare book from Mr Fredel's private collection, a citizen in the Ladys Ward.</p>

<p>Driving back to the Hive for the second time, Yoshi, this time with Ben, parks the car near the Mortuary again, then they start making their up into the spiderwebs, the cris cross of walkway, bridges and collasping high rises that is offically Mid and High Hive, tho no one usues those names, its just the Spiderwebs. Reaching the address, they are met by a rude, smelling, overweight human pointing a double barrelled shotgun at them, asking them what tey. Showing their badges, he lowers the gun and lets them in. he tells em that Marcus jones (the dead attacker) hasnt shown up for a week and he owes him a weeks rent - he tries to sell the flat to Ben an d Yoshi but they refuse. getting up to the door, the flat istelf is horried, part of the back wall is missing, poorly covered by a hanging brown dust sheet. The windows have had their glass smashed out long ago, the bed looks a little rotten, as does the couch. they hunt for clues and dust for fingerprints, yoshi nearly falls off the building while looking around not realsing that another piece opf wall is missing. They find a 9mm pistol has been missed, under the bed, a round already chambered. They bag and tag it, and grab the 4 sets of prints from a small wooden table, then they head back to the station, wanting lunch.</p>

<p>Chico heads to Mid Corps, where the case file saysn that Eric Wyvern works, but hes out for lunch. Asking, Chico finds out he usually has it at the Emerald Sea in Mid Corps. getting their, the cafe come resturant is not too busy and finds Eric sitting at a table by the window. Showing his badge Chico sits down. Eric tells much the same story as Charlotte and says they are childhood friends and he is worried about her and her business. Chico says he will try and help her out. Eric is a bit lost as to why they were attacked. After that, Chico picks up lunches for the team (fresh coffe and fruit salads) and heads back to the station. </p>

<p>Ryan takes the subway to the Ladys Ward, where he goes to the address of this Mr Fredel. The large mansion is very impressive. The door is answered by a humaniod with red skin and small horns, a teifling and is Lord Fredel's butler. He lets Ryan in and asks him to wait. returning, he escorts Ryan to the 3rd library to meet Lord Fredel. Standing by a fireplace is a 9 foot tall humaniod with red skin, sleek horns, long black hair and a black goatee. He introduces himself as Lord Fredel. Ryan asks to borrow a very rare book, Chronicling the desrtuction of Set during Ragnorok. The Lord eventually agrees to let Ryan borrow the book, but only for 7 days and says there will be consequences if he fails to bring the book back on time. ryan then also asks if the Lord is like is butler, which massivly insults the Lord. Tho most mortals would have been intimidated by the gaze of the Lord, Ryan was to native (maybe stupid) to realise his mistake. He left with the gaint oversized book, written in a language he cannot read, and heads back to the station.</p>

<p>meeting back at the station for lunch, the team disucss more of their findings, while yoshi gets to work on the forensics. Several hours laters, come dinnertime, they have some results. The gun matches ballistics of some of the rounds found at the scene, and they have 3 matches for the fingerprints (3 out of 4...not bad). The prints were; The landlord, the dead guy and a miss Aimee Doso. They grab her address and head off to talk to her at her apartment in Mid Clerks. Getting there, the blokc has balconies and soBen splits the team into 2. Him and Ryan go up the fire escapes of the balconies to wait outside her apartment, while yoshi and Chico go via the front door. Listneing outside, both pairs her a panicked woman talking to a man, saying that they are on to them and they have to leave. He tells her to hurry. at this point ryan using his new magics to curse the woman with Itches (its a low level gurps spell.....), but her companion sees Ryan outside the window. Quickly Ben gives the order to go in, the squad strom the room, guns drawn. The man makes a drive for the front door, drawing a gun. Ben knee caps the guy, who then collaspes to the floor. The woman quickly surrenders and then breaks down in tears. Chico calms down the blocks over residents as they come out to see what the noise is about. The team get the woman, Aimee, to tell them of a drop point somewhere in Low Indy, where their orders came from, but she doesnbt make much sesne. With paramidics arriving, the session finished there.</p>

<p>And tonight, we have the next installment of Sigil Vice <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/smile.png" title="Smiling" alt="Smiling" class="smiley-content"/></p>

         <p>EDIT: Aimee actually gave the team the address of a safe house, not a drop point....</p>

<p>Leaving the uniforms to finish up, the team head back to Clerks station. There they pick up Finlly, who has been kicked off the smuggling case by the lead detective for beating up an informatant. Ryan remains at the station. They head to Low indy, the address Aimee gave for the safe house. The street is a massive rows of terrace housing, red brick, each house three levels, each a seperate 'house'. Low indy is a dirty part of town, with smog and a chemical taste to the air. Again, the team splits into 2, Chico and Yoshi to go to the front door, while Ben and Finlly go round the back, a narrow path between the backyards. Reaching the back gate, Ben spots a small camera looking down the backyard, from above the back door. With eveyone in place, ben and Finlly rush the back door, to the surprise of Chico and Yoshi. Finlly dives through the glass panel of the back door in the house, with door flowing. Chico tries to kick the front door down, fails, then just shoots the lock out. They quickly sweep the house, but its clear. They find spare cloths, firearms, and some cash. They also find a crawl space. At the very enbd, yoshi finds an unmarked black box. Opening it, the team find a map of part of Low Indy, plus 3 pendants shaped as Ankhs.</p>

<p>Chicop and Ben quickly go house to hous to ask about the people who live in the house ,but no one seems to wont to be nosey neighbours, so the team follow the map, an x marking something close by. On the back of the map seems to be some bare directions "Left, then 200 yards, 2nd right" etc etc. Finding the location on the map, it is a manhole. The team go into the sewers and start following the directs on the back. As they progress along the sewers, Ben notices a rat following them. It looks like a normal rat apart from the top part of its brain is visible....it makes ben a little uncomfortable, but they continue on. As they do so,  another rat joins the first, then a third, then a forth. By the time they reach the end of the directions, there is a dozen rats sitting by the last corner and ben is very edgy. The directions end in a large circular area, between 2 main channels. At the very centre the team find a loose brick with a very faint eching of an ankh on it. Lifting it up, they discover a small circular case. Instead is a short letter written in some kind of code. Ben sends the image of it back to ryan at the station. Ryan says it might take a few hours to crack...</p>

<p>The team leaves the sewers, and Ben and Yoshi presuade the team to visit the Nytemare Motoercycle plant which they are almost right next to. there, chico pulls an Elf mechanic, and later makes use of the showers to clean up (tho his cloths were still a bit dirty), Finlly just gets some food, while Ben and Yoshi take a tour of the show rooms at the plant. They both are in heaven. Ben wants one of the best bikes there are, but their tour guide wont give him a credit line for it. Calling Chico (who was'busy at the time') Ben gets Chico to presuade the touri guide to sell a top of the range superbike to Ben. he also tries to get Ben to become a racer is the Abyssal Destruction Derbys, but ben wont ignore his police duties nor is he willing to kill over riders, a serious handicap in the Abyssal Derbys. The team then get a call from Ryan, saying that its gonna take all night to work out the cipher, so the team leave the plant and low indy, head back to their apartm ents, then go out to dinner. Chico takes them to a steak/BBQ house, which has a cowboy theme, owned by  a halfling everyone calls Benny.</p>

<p>The next morning, the team uncover the meaning of the cipher, a letter congratulating someone on their part of the strike and to keep up the good work. The team decide to go and interview Aimee Doso. She doesnt talk much, but it seems she believes in what she has done, and justifies her actions becaues of the loose of her boyfriend 2 years ago to 'them'. she seems unable to speka of 'them' byt their real name(s). After that, the team decide to talk with the man they shot yesterday, hes at clerks Hosiptal on Upper clerks. There, they interview him, with Chico playing good cop and finlly playing bad cop. Finlly is squeezing his IV drip to cause him pain. He doesnt tell them much, and insults the team a fair amount. Tho they begin to make progress, it seems the man is now high on pain killers as finlly's intimidations have been forcing painkillers into him. They have identified him as Quentin Harrison. Outside the bedroom, the team talk over their next move. They want to trick Quentin into believing one of them is Aimee and see if he'll tell her anything. Wanting this, Chico suddenly shifts into her. The whole team is rather surprised, but Chico makes the best use of it and goes in. He finds out that Quentin thinks hell get off free and tells her to meet him in Maelstrom, a safe city for them. As Ben comes back in to take 'Aimee' out, he glares at Quentin, then suddenly hears his thoughts and discovers the target's name was Eric Wyvern....</p>

<p>...and thats where the session finished, next one tonight <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/smile.png" title="Smiling" alt="Smiling" class="smiley-content"/></p>
