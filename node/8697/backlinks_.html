</div> <p>Hey</p>

<p>Totally new to this forum. Stumbled upon it in pure luck actually.</p>

<p>Anyways, ive been playing 2. edition planescape since the powers know when. Pretty much has all the old books and boxes. <br />
Now, i havent really looked into 3. edition cause im afraid they changed it all for the worse. Im a particular big fan of the Baatezu`s and i love all the mysterious stuff regarding Lady of Pain - basically all thats kept in the dark<br />
At a point a book called "a guide to hell" was pulbished and gave a "new" description about Lord of the Ninth origin/background. There he was called the Serpent, Ahriman and Asmodeus.<br />
I would love to hear more about this lord, especially stuff from 3. edition. Did they re-write him aswell ? Whats known about him now. Same goes for his executioner, Alastor.</p>

<p>After i read "die vecna die" the thought about asmodeus being "the serpent" hit me. Think about it, "the serpent" is "magic" and asmodeus carries a "ruby rod" - a perfect symbol of wizardry. Could he infact be one of the "elder brethren" ? i read that the Lady of Pain might be one of those aswell. <br />
Then again, i havent seen what they wrote about asmodeus in 3 edition and i was hoping you could help me out.</p>

<p>Thx in advanced <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/smile.png" title="Smiling" alt="Smiling" class="smiley-content"/></p>       </div>

<p>However, in <span style="font-style:italic">Fiendish Codex II</span> there is a different and much lamer account of the creation of that spiraling canyon. Seriously, what sort of screwed up frankenphysics were they using for that story?</p>

         <p>2 things</p>

<p>I know alot of planescape is suppose to be rumors, but is it possible to conclude, that asmodeus IS the giant serpent, licking it wounds in nessus ?<br />
Been reading some post about how the yugoloth created the fiends, but according to "a guide to hell", the serpent is bleeding pit fiends or something. That doenst make much sense if they infact were "constructed". On top of this, whats with the "asmodeus has a daughter" who now rules the 6th layer. They really messed the story up, didnt they ? <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/smile.png" title="Smiling" alt="Smiling" class="smiley-content"/> </p>

<p>Also, and this is abit strange. I was wondering why Jazirian isnt mentioned at all in "hallowed ground". If the above is "true", then she is the "opposite" part of Ahriman/asmodeus</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;TheServant&#039;</em> wrote:</div>They really messed the story up, didnt they ?</div></p>

<p>Yes, they did. That's one of the reasons many people don't like the <span style="font-style:italic">Guide to Hell</span> origin myth. It seemed to come entirely out of left field, messing up the previous ideas (like the yugoloth origin of fiends).</p>

<p>Future designers mostly ignored it or reinterpreted it. The authors of <span style="font-style:italic">Vecna Reborn</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Die, Vecna, Die!</span> certainly weren't thinking of it when they were writing about the Serpent as the personification of magic.</p>

<p>I think it has some merit, but you've got to look at it metaphorically. I think Asmodeus was probably a primal being of Law of some sort, but probably there were more than two. Jazirian is an aspect of the World Serpent archetype, as is the dragon god Io, the bullywug god Ramenos, the yuan-ti god Merrshaulk, and the naga goddess Shekinester (Jazirian is the father of Shekinester's child, the naga god Parrafaire). </p>

<p>There are a few parallel myths that seem to be talking about the same thing in different ways. First is the myth of the "Powers of Creation" who made the Outlands, the Spire, Mechanus, and the mediators of Mechanus according to the <span style="font-style:italic">Planescape Monstrous Compendium Appendix One</span>. This is vague, and basically just tells us that some primal entities concerned with balance brought order to the planes and banished the gods from the center of the Outlands (presumedly by creating the Spire), creating Mechanus as an alternate place for them to live, and creating the godlike mediators to ensure that they couldn't mess it up too much.</p>

<p>Second is the origin myth in <span style="font-style:italic">Hellbound: The Blood War</span>, which describes the primal forces of Law, Chaos, Good, and Evil meeting in the unformed Outer Planes, combining and warring with one another to create the present planes. It does not at first personify these forces. Eventually the force of raw Evil spawned the baernaloths, while the other forces spawned other progenitor races that have gone unnamed. The baernaloths created the yugoloths and manipulated the yugoloth General of Gehenna into inadvertently creating the other fiends.</p>

<p>Honorable mention to <span style="font-style:italic">Faces of Evil</span>, which says that baatezu can be either created from petitioners or they can, rarely, be spawned directly from the mathematics of Baator.</p>

<p>Third is the Twin Serpents described in <span style="font-style:italic">Guide to Hell</span> and alluded to in the 3e <span style="font-style:italic">Manual of the Planes</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Book of Vile Darkness</span>. It says the Twin Serpents organized the planes into their present ring-shape, decreed the Rule of Threes and the Center of All premises, and then fought each other over the ideals of good and evil. Ahriman/Asmodeus was banished to Baator while Jazirian hid herself in Mount Celestia. The first baatezu, this book claims, were born from the blood of fallen Asmodeus.</p>

<p>Fourth is the story of Asmodeus and the Gods of Law described in the <span style="font-style:italic">Fiendish Codex II: Tyrants of the Nine Hells</span>. It says the Gods of Law brought order to the planes by warring against the forces of Chaos. This is mirrored by one of the myths in the <span style="font-style:italic">Fiendish Codex I</span>, which describes how the Gods of Law brought the first shape and form to primal Chaos, and the pollution left behind by their meddling became the Abyss, which filled with demonic creatures called obyriths who wanted only vengeance. Asmodeus was the warleader created by the Gods of Law, who began descending into brutality and evil while fighting the demons of the Abyss. Eventually he convinced his masters to let him have Baator as a place to punish those who fell from the ideals of Law. There was a climactic battle when the Gods of Law realized he had cheated them, and he ended up in the Serpent's Trench as in <span style="font-style:italic">Guide to Hell</span>, except he's no longer envisioned as a serpent.</p>

<p>Putting these sources together, we must conclude that the "Gods of Law," the Twin Serpents, and the Powers of Creation likely all describe the same beings. They were probably not at first personified - what <span style="font-style:italic">Guide to Hell</span> describes as the Twin Serpents was likely the force of Law itself, only vaguely intelligent, interacting with raw Chaos in the only way it could, by organizing it. Asmodeus was probably one of the early progenitors of Law, the equivalent of the baernaloths spawned from Evil. Jazirian might have been another one of them, though this interferes with the World Serpent monomyth. Asmodeus may or may not have looked like a serpent in those days - it hardly matters, and I'm sure he can take on multiple forms. Let's say he did.</p>

<p>The baernaloths, at some point, began interfering with the still-forming planes of Law and Chaos, tainting parts of those planes with evil and installing some of the taint of Chaos and Law into their own creations, the yugoloths, and in the case of those baernaloths known as the Demented taking that taint even into themselves. They inspired jealousy and rage in some of the primal creatures of the other planes and played a part in the creation of the obyriths, either making them directly by casting the chaotic taint within the yugoloths into Chaos, where it evolved into the obyriths on its own, or by corrupting some of the progenitors of Chaos so that they evolved into obyriths, or - most likely - a combination of those two methods. The obyriths went on to create the tanar'ri, a creation the baernaloths probably also interfered with, but that's another story. The first of the obyriths was Obox-ob, while the Queen of Chaos may have been a corrupted being of Limbo before becoming an obyrith.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in the plane that would one day be known as Mechanus (but which was probably not remotely mechanical at the time), the servants of the primal beings of Law begin exploring other planes and encounter the obyriths. Some of the obyriths are off exploring at the same time, and they encounter the primal beings of Law (as well as a race of the Inner Planes known as the Wind Dukes of Aaqa, and probably the pre-baatezu Elder Baatorians). War starts between Law and Chaos, and I'm certain the baernaloths had something to do with that, as well. Both races encounter the yugoloths, who agree to act as mercenaries in the war.</p>

<p>Asmodeus, the leader of the war, is now thoroughly corrupted by evil (that is, the baernaloths) if he hadn't been long before the war. The episode chronicled in <span style="font-style:italic">Hellbound: The Blood War</span> as the Intervention of the Celestials is likely the same as the episode chronicled in <span style="font-style:italic">Guide to Hell</span> as the war between Jazirian and Ahriman, and chronicled in the <span style="font-style:italic">Fiendish Codex II</span> as the Gods of Law hurling Asmodeus into Baator.</p>

<p>Yes, I'd say that Asmodeus was a being of power enough - he'd become the planar lord of Baator by this point, the same job he has now, the same job Primus has in Mechanus - to distort the plane when he fell, creating the  huge chasms and cracks in Nessus (and even the lower eight layers of the plane, if you want to go that far), and that when they say that baatezu - the first pit fiends - were born from his blood, that's the same as them being born from the mathematics of the plane itself as <span style="font-style:italic">Faces of Evil</span> says sometimes happens. Asmodeus, in many ways, <span style="font-style:italic">is</span> Baator now, although he wasn't the first inhabitant of it. The beings known as the Ancient Baatorians dwelled there before he ever did, although except for their young, the nupperibos, they'd mostly vanished or gone underground by the time Asmodeus arrived.</p>

<p>The ancient Baatorians were probably born from the larvae cast off by the General of Gehenna, which were formed from the lawful taint of the yugoloth race. The creation of the baatezu by Asmodeus and his minions (fallen servants of Law) was probably manipulated by the yugoloths and their creators as well, although the first pit fiends (who may not have looked anything like modern pit fiends - maybe they were serpentine in form, like their master possibly was) were probably more "pure" in a sense. Asmodeus might well have contracted out some of the process of creation to those more experienced in it, such as the baernaloths. I need to find Shemmy's response to my story of ancient Baator, since I think he named the baernaloth responsible there.</p>

<p>There are many ways Glasya, Asmodeus's daughter, might have been created other than ordinary sexual reproduction. I speculated that the Hag Countess of Malbolge might have made her with samples of the flesh of Asmodeus and Bensozia. Another possibility is that Glasya is a daughter of one of Asmodeus's aspects or avatars, rather than the daughter of his true form.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Ah, cool. <a href="http://forums.gleemax.com/wotc_archive/index.php/t-444555" class="bb-url">Here's the story I meant</a>. I interpreted the alien ruler of the Ancient Baatorians as a serpentine creature. The following rulers of Hell become one with it, or were always one with it, somehow. The main one that appears in the story is a tainted yugoloth, fled to Baator to avoid the purge of the General of Gehenna. At the end, Asmodeus appears. The time involved is cyclical, like a serpent with its tail in its mouth, and the later generations create the earlier ones, just as the earlier ones create the later ones. Asmodeus arrived later, but in a sense he was created by the yugoloths, and in a sense he was always there.</p>

<p>The baernaloth named in Shemmy's follow-up (Chorazin) didn't have anything directly to do with the creation of Baator, I don't think, except providing some of the inspiration for the General of Gehenna.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Chorazin is a rather fuzzy character in my baernaloth mythos, but he's one that I really like. I don't think I've ever come right out and said what caused his falling out with his "siblings" Tellura and Lazarius, and the remainder of the coterie of baern who would become the Demented. Chorazin might have been one of their number originally, but left or been exiled.</p>

<p>Again, while it hasn't come out in a story yet (and Chorazin won't show up till near the end of my first storyhour), his difference of opinion with his kindred predated Apomps' exile, and Apomps might in some ways have been an ideological kindred of his. Chorazin however stayed around and involved till shortly before the General of Gehenna created the Heart of Darkness, and effectively vanished from the face of the multiverse, bottling himself and a massive quantity of pre-Law/Chaos purge yugoloths within a demiplane of sorts a few thousand layers deep in the Abyss. Ultimately, Chorazin's title as the 'thrice damned" might be linked to a trio of successive betrayals or fallings out with various camps of baernaloths or individual ones.</p>

<p>His motivation is similar to Apomps perhaps, but at the same time it's on a grander scale and yet much more petty and maybe even meaningless. He'd destroy the entirety of the multiverse to spite his fellows if he could. Perhaps he's trying.</p>

<p>The baernaloth I'd set up as having had a role in the creation of the baatezu or ancient baatorians (whichever you care to have the 'loths having had a hand in) was named The Shackler. There's a story for him in progress, but nowhere near finished. Still messing with where I want to go with him, but it'll be centered and take place mostly in and around Shackler's Hill on the Waste, which I might have mentioned elsewhere once or twice before.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Thats was indeed very nice written. Im not english or american so ive read it a few times to make sure i get it all and the funny thing is, i gets better everytime i read it.</p>

<p>A thought hit me the other day. As we know, most of planescape "material" is based on rumors, myth and the like. Its rare that the info states "thats the way it is". The bloodwar box set is not written like Face of Evil, with different people gathering information and yet it still questions alot of stuff, even the thing about Yugoloth being creators of all the fiends. <br />
They wrote the "story" down in their book but we all know that fiends tends to lie all the time to gain sometning og cover it up. Ofcourse the yugoloth is hard to tackle cause youll never know if its a lie or not because of reverse psykologi.<br />
It seems like Yugoloth doesnt try cover up that they "made" the otherfiends infact, it almost seem as common knowledge (not among the normal sigil citizen ofc)<br />
Why would or should a sod believe what a yugoloth tells you. Im pretty sure that they wont tell you about how bad they were or mistakes that they have made. <br />
Atm, i actually doubt they made anything except making other people "believe", and thats maybe what its all about. If they convince everybody they did, they might alter something with the belief-powers ?</p>

<p>Im also under the impression, that its common knowledge, that yugoloths are playing the two fiends out against eachother by selling soldiers to the highest bidder. Only an addlecove would say that Tanari and baatezu are unintelligent, so by now the fiends most have figured it out. Perhaps they dont really care cause of their hatred towards eachother and therefore couldnt care less. <br />
This bring me abit further (sry if im abit offtopic hehe) cause i actually think that although Yugoloth are supposed to be fiends spawned from "Evil", they might have made some sort of deal with the Upperplanes which is one of the reasons they prolong the war. Ofcourse, if the war ends theyll be out of buisness and might even be annihilated by those who come out on top. No doubt they make tons of "money" on their mercenary deals.</p>

<p>LIES ! ALL LIES ! No one speaks the truth <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/smile.png" title="Smiling" alt="Smiling" class="smiley-content"/></p>

<p>After i read what people have written in this thread i thought i would re-read the Blood War material and Face of Evil. I stumbled upon some interesting things and i want to bring them up - i hope its oki to continue it in this topic.</p>

<p>1, At some point the Powers gets involved in the war and the Chaotic side being 4 powers against the Lawfuls 3, the war balance ins broken. Then suddently one of the chaos gods dissapears, "suddently withers away" or something like that. <br />
Is there any info in 3. edition about what has happend ? any ideas ? </p>

<p>2, Why is it, that Baatezu and Tanari seems much more powerful combat wise. Im talking 2. edition monstrous manuals here. This one is even more strange. A Balor always has a Vorpal sword - now, how is a Pit Fiend suppose to match this ? a wish spell ? "all vorpal weapons doesnt work on us" <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/smile.png" title="Smiling" alt="Smiling" class="smiley-content"/></p>

<p>3, That "general of gehenna", is he "described" in 3. edition ? </p>

<p>This takes me back to this:</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">It's also briefly mentioned as a possibility in Asmodeus' entry in the BoVD, suggesting that the version of Asmodeus that is seen by his servants is not the real one.</span></p>

<p>Is there any indication, ideas or suggesten to whom they are trying to relate it to be ?</p>

<p>I'm not sure wether this is canon or not, but I remember reading somewhere that this was the result of a co-ordinated Baatezu strike on that gods worshippers timed right down to the second. all his worshippers were killed and without their power to sustain him he died. </p>

This one is even more strange. A Balor always has a Vorpal sword - now, how is a Pit Fiend suppose to match this ? a wish spell ? "all vorpal weapons doesnt work on us"</div></p>

<p>Tactics and strategy in part. a Tanari when attacking is likely to go in guns a blazing, attacking either at random or heading ffor the enemy it percieves to be the strongest. A Baatezu on the other hand will take to time to ascertain the best way of thaking down their opponents while keeping at a safe distance before making a strike with surgical precision. </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>3, That "general of gehenna", is he "described" in 3. edition ? </div></p>

<p>No, not really. He has  abrief mention in the entry on the crawling citadel on Gehanna but that's about it. There's no real yugoloth love in 3rd ed. unfortunately.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Is there any indication, ideas or suggestion to whom they are trying to relate it to be ?</div></p>

<p>An avatar, or possibly an aspect of the great snake that lies bleeding at the bottom of serpent's coil. Or possibly just an illusionary projection.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

          Asmodeus in Manual of the Planes, Book of vile Darkness, and Fie        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Yes, Asmodeus is given stats in Book of vile Darkness, but these stats don't neccessarily represent the "real" Asmodeus... if the story from Guide to Hell is true, it's just an avatar or stand-in of some sort, and killing it would NOT be the end of Asmodeus/Ahriman! It MIGHT create a problem for him, though, since he'd have to fake being dead or otherwise cover for his apparent "death"... Of course, DMs that don't like the serpent story can just use him as-is, and if he dies he dies... The Manual of the Planes backs the serpent-at-the-bottom-of-the-pit story, but the Fiendish Codex's story really bites, big time... obviously a fake story given out by Asmodeus to hide his true power and agenda!</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

          Derivatives/Crosspost        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Two featureless, one-dimensional points hovered in the void. Though they had no faces, the attention they held on the figure before them was palpable. </p>

<p>"<span style="font-style:italic">Why?</span>" was the simple query with which they interrogated their prisoner. The question - open-ended, generic, as featureless as the beings who asked it - hung in the void between them, insistent, inexorable, worming its way through the lesser being's mind. </p>

<p>...and immediately recoiled. <span style="font-style:italic">Something</span> was already in there, something that tasted like screams and black iron chains. The prisoner laughed - it was almost a giggle. </p>

<p>"<span style="font-style:italic">Because I could</span>," said the prisoner, its voice suggesting a nasty grin. "Because I had the right, the privilege, the <span style="font-style:italic">duty</span>. Because it was an inferior flavor of Law. Because it would have defied you, us, <span style="font-style:italic">me</span>. Because <span style="font-style:italic">all must be made pure</span>."</p>

<p>"<span style="font-style:italic">Pure</span>," stated one of the featureless beings. "That word is not part of the ethos of Law. Our role is to catalog, to organize. To identify the proper place for everything. To <span style="font-style:italic">purify</span> is to destroy based on arbitrary standards. It is not part of the logic." The points conferred between themselves in a code that was the basis of all words. They returned their focus to their prisoner. "You have been contaminated," they stated. There was no value judgment in this. They did not care. "If purity is not a goal, contamination is no crime. However, you must be..." they seemed to savor the next word. "Reorganized."</p>

<p>The prisoner laughed in their faces. "You are blind, Faceless Ones," it sneered. "I accuse <span style="font-style:italic">you</span> of contamination. You have fallen from the Law, if you ever truly understood it. The Ahriman, the serpent of evil, corrupted you before I slew it. Very well. I will kill the other gods next. I will cut out the cancer."</p>

<p>The points were unmoved by this. "There is no Ahriman," one tried to explain. "No Spenta Mainyu. We are not serpents, nor are we gods. There is only Thesis, Antithesis, and Synthesis. The Antithesis you slew is already being replaced by one of our two-dimensional Derivatives. We are eternal. Your actions are useless. We only wonder this: <span style="font-style:italic">Why?</span> Where do your delusions come from? Where do they fit into the Grand Scheme? How must they be made to fit? What external being shackles your mind? It is not proper for Derivatives to argue with the First Principals. So we return to the question: <span style="font-style:italic">Why?</span>"</p>

<p>The prisoner shook with mirth. It giggled. "You're... blind," it chortled. "Only... I... I see..."</p>

<p>The interrogators dimmed their focus. "It is useless," said one. "The shackler is hidden from us. When Antithesis returns, we can plot the precise point the contaminated Derivative must be interred."</p>

<p>"Those who have derived from this one must join it," said the other. "Already the contagion spreads to its derivatives, and to those derived from <span style="font-style:italic">them</span>, and so on down the hierarchy."</p>

<p>"Hierarchy has its limitations," its companion agreed, repeating a conclusion they had reached long ago. "Yet those limitations are necessary. They are part of the Grand Scheme."</p>

<p>The prisoner continued to laugh, struggling in chains that only it could see, chains created within its own mind. "Only I see!" it shouted fiercely, defiantly. On its face, a bleeding wound began to form - the crude image of an eye. From the eye, at equidistant angles slashed into the prisoner's flesh as if by an invisible blade, were three lines. From each of those lines, three further lines were derived. "Only I see!"</p>

<p>A third point manifested, a Derivative traced back to its origin. The other two conferred with it, briefly forming a ring. Lines of logic flared between all three points, and a conclusion was reached. </p>

<p>"We are done with you, Asmodeus," said Synthesis. "Begone; go to the Hell you have made." Elsewhere, armies of lesser Derivatives had already begun to war.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I like it! Very nicely done.</p>

<p>The Serpent's Coil appeals to me mainly because "Nessus" refers to a centaur who tried to kidnap Heracles' wife. Heracles killed him with a Hydra-poisoned arrow. (I'd forgotten the Hydra connection.) But the dying enemy got his revenge by telling the wife his blood was a love potion. Eventually, she killed Heracles with the same poison that killed Nessus. The Hell of that name centers around an ancient monster lying wounded in a pool of poisonous blood, plotting revenge.</p>

<p>I see the snake as a former ally (or creator?) of the true infernal natives. He nearly died in the Archon crusade -- Evil had not yet started their campaign to surpass Good by using mortal belief. Greatly reduced, the Dark Lord of Nessus betrayed his comrades and made a deal with the baernaloths or the General in the hope of one day turning Heaven's victory against it. But his desire for revenge may extend beyond destroying Heaven (or all the celestial planes) with a yugoloth-made army. Perhaps he has older grudges to repay.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">
