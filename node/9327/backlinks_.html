          Githyanki Historical Personalities        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
        <div class="dice_rolls">
</div> <p><span style="font-size:14px">Githyanki Historical Personalities:</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Fune-Zaad (FOO-neh ZAHD):  </span></p>

<p>One of the first of the Githyanki knights, Fune-Zaad is often regarded as a role model for future generations of zealots.  Tireless and unwavering in his loyalty to the Revered Queen, he did not hesitate to carry out some of Her most unpopular orders.  Some believe that Fune-Zaad was particularly instrumental in the extinguishment of all other members of the royal family, though one won't find that detail in Githyanki history books.  Those books do describe how he personally thwarted multiple assassination attempts, at considerable risk to his own life.</p>

<p>Even by knightly standards, Fune-Zaad was notorious as a smiter of heretics.  (Unfortunately, not only were genuine unbelievers purged en masse during this period, a huge number of intellectuals, scholars, artists, philosophers, and similar sorts were tortured and slain as well.)  Despite the swath he cut through the Githyanki intellectual and artistic communities, Fune-Zaad knew his way around a pen himself, and wrote a number of articulate tracts defending the reign of the most recent Queen and picking apart the arguments of various heretics and unbelievers.  More than once his contemporary detractors accused him of 'doing things' with the dead that one ought not to, a practice that githyanki generally regarded as horrific at that time.  (Githyanki knights have been periodically accused of this practice ever since, though it seems to raise fewer eyebrows these days.)</p>

<p>Fune-Zaad was eventually 'retired' by the Revered Queen and rewarded with undeath.  Exactly which form of undeath is mostly uncertain, and believed to be one of the mysteries kept by the knightly orders.  Some outside these orders claim that he was transformed into a fairly typical sword-spirit, while others claim he became a death knight, a vampire, or something else.  It is one of the great historical ironies that Fune-Zaad originated, long ago, from the same warband that Warlord Zetch'r'r now commands.  Whatever his current form, Fune-Zaad is probably not happy about the latter fact.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sar'yel-Reth (saar-YEHL-REHTH):</span></p>

<p>One of the most famous Githyanki playwrights, Sar'yel-Reth's works date back some four thousand years.  Many quotations from his plays have since become common Githyanki sayings.  Sar'yel-Reth was unusually well-traveled for a Githyanki, with a great deal of knowledge concerning the far-flung Githyanki cities (and their various cultural idiosyncracies) and even of enemy and barbarian races.  A few historians have accused the playwright of various questionable political leanings, as he did not hesitate to deal with inflammatory subjects (the githyanki-githzerai war, the possible return of the Liberator, the nature of githyanki-<span style="font-style:italic">graith</span> cultural relations among them), though this idea is inconclusive at best -- his characters espouse a huge variety of political views applicable to his day, and it's less certain which ones Sar'yel-Reth himself favored.  In any case, his work remains very popular among modern githyanki.</p>

<p>Not all that much is known of Sar'yel-Reth's life, beyond his great personal charisma and the fact that he and his troupe personally performed for the royal family on several occasions, bringing them vast honor and status.  He also traveled to and performed in Sigil (!) several times, doing much to popularize the Githyanki arts there, but was eventually slain by an audience member mid-performance.  The official story is that he was killed by a young Githzerai looking to make a name for himself, but some claim differently... Some believe that he was quietly assassinated during a period of particularly vicious infighting among the royal family.  Others believe that Sar'yel-Reth orchestrated his own death, in order to die in as dramatic and 'artistic' a manner as possible.  Still others believe he was assassinated in order to 'heat up' a particularly violent period of the War of Two Skies, while others think he was bumped off by one or another of Sigil's "powers that be" who seriously disliked him.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Ezad'ara (eh-zahd-AHR-a):</span></p>

<p>A renowned scholar even today, Ezad'ara dates back quite some time, to the reign of Vlaakith XXIV.  He is also one of the earlier historical examples of a projective telepath among the Githyanki.  According to contemporary accounts, after Ezad'ara had been driven out by his home city, he deliberately came to Tu'narath and successfully sought an audience with his Queen.  [It is to be noted that some of the line of Vlaakith, particularly in more ancient times, were significantly more accessible than the most recent wielder of the Scepter of Ephelomon.]  He promptly claimed that two members of Her own court were Illithid thralls, and that he could provide proof of it.  It did not take long for Ezad'ara to gain prestige (along with his share of enemies) in the royal court, and it is during Vlaakith XXIV's reign that telepathy begins to be used in a systematic manner as a way to maintain and extend royal control over the Githyanki populace -- not only by identifying illithid thralls and githzerai assassins, but to keep an 'eye' on githyanki malcontents.</p>

<p>Even Ezad'ara's worst contemporary detractors commented positively on his profound personal loyalty to his Queen, and the psion is particularly well-known for his writings on the nature of <span style="font-style:italic">shij</span> (which are still enjoyed by many knights today).  He also wrote on many other subjects, particularly those of interest to psions.  His texts on psi-domination and the nature of the Githyanki mind, however, might make a typical githyanki more than a bit uncomfortable.  While those particular writings are not actually forbidden, they are not usually readily accessible to the general public (being considered too inflammatory for them to handle).  However, many psions, and most telepaths, have read them.</p>

<p>While Ezad'ara enjoyed an unusually long life, he eventually expired, like so many famous Githyanki, in a spectacular manner.  During the course of his service to the Revered Queen, he accidentally discovered what historians referred to "something he ought not to know" or even "a mystery of the royal house."  [Githyanki of more extreme political views love to make claims about exactly what the 'mystery' was -- perhaps something threatening to the legitimacy of the line of Vlaakith and their right to rule.]  In any case, because of this, Vlaakith XXIV very politely and graciously 'asked' him to commit suicide and had one of her personal guards hand him a blade; Ezad'ara took his own life on the spot.</p>       </div>

         <p>As always, a pleasure to read your musings.</p>

<p>I’m a bit puzzled by Fune-Zaad’s fate, though. I get being rewarded with undeath, but why retire him? He was (still is?) the perfect serving agent of the Queen, and it sounds like he would enjoy that role for… well, eternity, if possible.</p>

<p>Does he still exist to present day? I imagine that even if retired, he would prefer to stick as close as allowed to the Queen’s Palace – especially if he’s also been around in the last Vlaakith’s era, considering her undeath and his… “inclinations”. Of course, that also may make it likely that he was destroyed when the Queen was.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;Zimrazim&#039;</em> wrote:</div>More than once his contemporary detractors accused him of 'doing things' with the dead that one ought not to, a practice that githyanki generally regarded as horrific at that time.  (Githyanki knights have been periodically accused of this practice ever since, though it seems to raise fewer eyebrows these days.)</div>
I must admit, it immediately made me think of <a href="http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0446.html" class="bb-url">Tsukiko</a> from OOTS. <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/lol.png" title="Laughing out loud" alt="Laughing out loud" class="smiley-content"/></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

</div><br />
Ah, of course. I even used "retire" in the same sense earlier today.</p>

<p>Anyway, despite undead possibly having a more secluded role, I expect Fune-Zaad would still feel driven to much of his earlier role, considering your emphasis on <span style="font-style:italic">shij</span>.<br />
<span style="font-size:7px">Cue the "Purpose" speech from the Matrix 2.</span></p>

<p>By the way, what does the rumours say on his little fetish after having joined the ranks of the (un)dead?  :mrgreen:</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

          Githyanki Historical Personalities        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Gim'khaa-Suul (gim-KA-SOol):</span></p>

<p>A very powerful warlock from the reign of one of the middle Vlaakiths.  Gim'k was a wizard and scholar, and so unlike the more common sorcerer-warlocks who draw their control of the Arcane by virtue of blood rather than research and study. </p>

<p>He became a close confidant of Vlaakith LXXXIX after winning a great victory in her name (which may have actually been against Vlaakith LXXXVIII), becoming Ghim'khaa-Suul. <span style="font-style:italic">[Githyanki often change their names over their lives, when their social status, caste, or even life circumstances, change.]</span></p>

<p>Alternately revered by astral scholars and held up as a paragon of over-ambition, he set himself to the task of collecting historical texts from earlier reigns and putting them into vast, and locked, fortress-libraries in far corners of the Astral.  Their records were reviewed and purged many times by later Vlaakiths, but hidden caches of documents and arcane writings are discovered to this very day, sometimes in long-overlooked places.</p>

<p>Gim'khaa-Suul was a powerful diviner, and it is said had a knack for seeing the "little picture".  The most famous example of this comes from a story from <span style="font-style:italic">The Battle For The Stonesky Vault</span>.  Gim'khaa-Suul was with the Queen and her generals, reviewing the troops as they musterd for an attack.  Seemingly bored by the procedings throughout, untill passing a particular low-rank githwarrior who he'd seemingly been looking for the whole time.</p>

<p>"You are afraid." he said, and though the warrior tried to hide and deny it, it was plain for all to see.  "Be afraid then.  You will die today.  But only through your sacrifice will this war be won."</p>

<p>Future sages have made competing claims as to how this prophesy worked itself out.  The most common story is that the warrior, no longer fearing the inevidible, held a narrow passage against untold odds.  This story is told mostly by moralists, however, not serious researchers.  A famous play by B'n-saahn (bin-sAAn) has a character called "General Gim" telling this to a total of nine characters, who each contibute to winning the war in their own way, none of which would have worked in isolation.  The account held to be most probable states that the soldier's band was over-run, and she died protecting a warlock who was able to bring down the roof of a critical cavern in an act of despiration that, many battles hence, became a critical factor in the final resolution of the entire campaign.  Hence that one death, and the few seconds it bought, were neccissary.</p>

<p>Gim'khaa-Suul's ultimate fate is unknown.  It is commonly held that he was last seen by githyanki eyes leaving on a solitary and secret mission into the deep Astral.  Loyalists contend that the mission was at the behest of the Queen, while some heritics have claimed quite the opposite, that he fled from the Queen's Honor.  Interestingly, loyalist dogma has never strongly pursued either claim in the long reign of the Vlaakiths, and he remains an enigma, neither a paragon of loyalty nor of betrayal.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p><span style="font-size:9px">Meh.  Not so good as I hoped it'd be.  I wanted a reason for githyanki PC to be able to find lost records "by strange coincidence" but the character lacks consistancy</span></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

          Githyanki Historical Personalities        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Shass'a &amp; Stk-Kaa (shAs-Ah) &amp; (STICK - Ka) :</span></p>

<p>Historical figures whose lives were used as alegories in many githyanki plays and literature, Shass'a and Stk-Kaa are a blend of fact and fiction.  What is known is that they were both <span style="font-style:italic">varsh</span>-caste at the same fortress-nursury, the joint holding of several warbands, hidden deep in the underdark of a prime world.  Shass'a had been of the band of Lapis, while Stk-Kaa was a Bloodstone.  They are an example of <span style="font-style:italic">sho'dai</span> ["Truly-Close"], total devotion to another to the exclusion of all others.  Not as common among the gregarious githyanki as among the <span style="font-style:italic">graith</span>*, but certainly not unheard of.  </p>

<p>Three famous works by Sar'yel-Reth; <span style="font-style:italic">Dark Souls</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">Sons of Death</span>, and <span style="font-style:italic">Sword &amp; Shieth</span>, tell the story of Shass'a and Stk-Kaa, but he took great liberties in the details in favor of dramatic storytelling.  Over time, and due in no small part to to popularity of the plays, the verson of events set forth by the famous playwright are considered historical fact by most githyanki.</p>

<p>Shass'a and Stk-Kaa may have actually been <span style="font-style:italic">sho'dai</span> before their ordeals, but in <span style="font-style:italic">Dark Souls</span> they are rival trainers, sending their students and themselves into increasingly more serious situations to try and outdo each other and claim the greater glory for their warbands. As <span style="font-style:italic">varsh</span> they would have trained and tested many young warriors, that much is certain.</p>

<p>The <span style="font-style:italic">varsh'isk</span> in which they lived was at war with more than one illithid sept, and though the githyanki destroyed the nearer one, another far deeper one attacked while they were weakened from their hard-fought victory.  The <span style="font-style:italic">varsh'isk</span> was destroyed, but the illithid managed to overcome and capture some gith without killing them, and dragged the unfortunates back down into the lower depths.  History has a way of repeating itself though, and the illithid were weakened from their victory, enough so that the githyanki were able to sieze a moment for revolt before reaching the sept.  Most were killed in their desperate escape-attempt, but a few managed to liberate themselves.  Unfortunately, they were now unarmed, weakened, and without provision in what is perhaps the most hostile environment a prime plane can deliver.  How many managed to get away is uncertain, and of those some may have been recaptured.  In any case, it is agreed that their devotion to one another was a deciding factor in the hard-won survival of the <span style="font-style:italic">sho-dai</span>.  Their skills complemented each other, Shass'a of Lapis being a trained psion while Stk-Kaa of Bloodstone was a <span style="font-style:italic">Gish</span>, and they knew each other's skills and minds as well as they knew their own.  Eventually, of all the escapees, only these two survived the horrors and deprivation of the lowerdark, and after a long time (anywhere from "a great many months" to several years in one version) made their way to another far away<span style="font-style:italic"> varsh'isk</span> and back among The People.  </p>

<p>One major detail of the story may have been a fabrication on the part of Sar'yel-Reth.  It is commonly held that Shass'a and Stk-Kaa did not speak overmuch of their ordeals, for there was much pain in the memories.  Still, it is said that one or the other of them had been nearly ready to lay when they were abducted.**  In <span style="font-style:italic">Sons of Death</span>, both were with egg, and they then hatch and try to raise their childen in the hostile environs, with ultimately tragic results.  While this version is certainly possible, the Lapis have an oral tradition that states only Shass'a was with egg, and that while the pair hatched and raised the child in a fairly verdant set of caverns they'd found at the time, they were eventually forced to canbalize the child after moving on.  The band of Bloodstone reject both versions, claiming that both had layed while still captive, but destroyed their eggs in order to deny them to The Enemy.</p>

<p>The pair remained devoted to each other for the rest of their lives.  They remained tied to their respective warbands, uncommon but not unheard of among <span style="font-style:italic">sho'dai</span>.  They each attained great fame and status, due in great part to the skills and knowledge they acquired in their long ordeal.  Eventually, Shass'a was killed in battle with the illithid.  Stk-Kaa went mad with grief, throwing herself into a fanatical quest for vengence, becoming "A sword without a shieth."  She too was killed shortly thereafter.  Such was the genius of Sar'yel-Reth that there remain two interpretations of the conclusion of the story.  Total devotion to another may be the greatest of strenths, for Stk-Kaa's madness is a woe upon the illithid, but it also proves to be her downfall, for unable to live without her <span style="font-style:italic">sho'dai</span>, she seeks her own death.</p>

<p>*There is no parallel institution to the <span style="font-style:italic">graith</span> tradition of marriage.  One warrior usually just joins the the other of their warbands, though the ranking officers must approve of any switch.  Traditionally, the smaller of the two warbands gets the additional warrior, to help swell its ranks.  Occasionally, both <span style="font-style:italic">sho'dai</span> remain tied to their respective warbands, especially if the warriors are in positions of some status or the warband itself is presigious or notorious.<br />
**<span style="font-style:italic">Sho-dai</span> are not restricted to male-female pairings, though these are the most common.  Those considered true <span style="font-style:italic">sho'dai</span> are completely monagamous, but this is not always the case.  Additionally, many <span style="font-style:italic">varsh</span>-caste serve a role roughly equivilant to prostitutes, though with the additional duty to propigate the species, and lacking the exploitation, degradation, greed, and violence associated with the selling of sex in other cultures.</p>
