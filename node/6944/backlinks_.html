         <p>Moogle, you may want to consider using the so-called "lesser planetouched".  "Lesser-planetouched" are planetouched with the Humanoid subtype who are still affected as Outsiders by banishment-type spells.  THey are LA +0, finally an acceptable way to balance the planetouched.</p>

<p>I'm not sure where these are detailed but its in one of the newer WotC books.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I totally support the non-outsider planetouched. The accent in the revised edition is on the extraplanar subtype anyway, not on the outsider type. THe aasimar and tiefling can be banished as easy as anyone else who is not native to a plane, but they are not given the immortality (temporal) and immunity to <span style="font-style:italic">raise dead</span>. </p>

<p>If it were up to me, I'd even remove the "default" darkvision from the aasimar, since celestials should have no default affinity with darkness, but that's just me...</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Indeed Moogle.  Now, I know that we don't want to be going in and making lots of changes from the established material - that kind of stuff should be saved for House Rules.  However, the PW planetouched match up witht he "lesser planetouched" so I think that just changing the LAs of the PW planetouched to +0 and not +1 would not be against WotC's current thinking.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>The two planetouched are LA +1, as they should be. Elemental resistance plus nice ability modifiers - it's a +1. </p>

<p>Now, the githyanki and githzerai at +2? Not sure. I play "psionics are different", so their PR is not as useful against spells. I keep thinking about making them LA +1, but the 'zerai's +6 Dex is still bugging me.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Well, that's not quite true. Native and Extraplanar are just subtypes that determine whether you are prime-born or plane-born, regardless of your creature type. Just as you can have extraplanar humandoids, aberrations, and whatnot, you can have native outsiders. For example, an aasimon born on the Prime Material would be listed as Outsider (Native).</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>That doesn't make any sense to me, though. The "native outsider" type is entirely a convenience created for the sake of the planetouched. If the planetouched aren't outsiders, you don't need it.</p>

<p>Essentially, the "native" subtype means a creature has inherited a mortal soul, meaning it can be raised or resurrected as normal. Most outsiders don't have them (or, more accurately, they <span style="font-style:italic">are</span> spirits or souls).</p>

<p>The rules say that half-outsiders and planetouched get the native subtype regardless of what plane they were born on. This makes sense; they get the ability to host souls from their mortal ancestors. </p>

<p>This all falls apart when you start letting outsiders with no mortal blood become "natives." Where does their soul come from? Are they something you can "catch" from staying in the Material Plane for too long, like an infection? I think giving rakshasas and couatls the native subtype is a <span style="font-style:italic">serious</span> flaw in the rules, and I hate it a lot more than making the planetouched outsiders. Humanoids or native outsiders - I think that's just a matter of opinion, dependent on what inherited traits you think are dominant. If you think that outsider traits tend to dominate mortal blood across many generations, make them native outsiders. If you think their outsider blood is too watered down to manifest itself fully, make them humanoids.</p>

<p>Anyway, I think the extraplanar subtype more than adequately represents the difference between a slaad spawned in Limbo and a slaad spawned in Manhattan's East Village without having to bring souls into it.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>If that were true, the "native" subtype would be completely redundant. But it's not; it has very specific consequences - native outsiders need to eat and sleep, and they have souls. Why should a minor thing as what plane the creature was born on result in such radical physical and metaphysical changes? </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div> You slap it onto creatures that would, by default, be extraplanar, when they actually are not extraplanar - the prime-born outsiders.</div></p>

<p>There's no reason to assume that outsiders are extraplanar by default, though, any more than there's any reason to assume that beasts, giants, dragons, plants, vermin, or humanoids are by default native to the Material Plane. Creature type has nothing to do with what plane you're from - that's what the extraplanar subtype is for.</p>

<p>And, of course, nothing is extraplanar on its own plane. </p>

<p>Outsiders are defined in D&amp;D 3.5 as creatures "at least partially composed of the essence (but not necessarily the material) of some plane other than the Material Plane," which doesn't necessarily mean they're <span style="font-style:italic">from</span> an other plane. Couatls are composed of the essence of Mount Celestia, no matter where they brood. Rakshasas are composed of the essence of Acheron, even if they birth their litters on the Prime. </p>

<p>If they have some other reason for needing to eat, sleep, and having souls seperate from their bodies, that needs to be explained. I can't imagine what it might be.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>If you do rule that anything with prime blood is "native", you may be stretching it a little too far.</div></p>

<p>It's not <span style="font-style:italic">my</span> rule; it's the official rule. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Native Subtype:</span> A subtype applied only to outsiders. These creatures have mortal ancestors or a strong connection to the Material Plane and can be raised reincarnated, or resurrected just as other living creatures can be. Creatures with this subtype are native to the Material Plane (hence the subtype's name). <br />
Unlike true outsiders, native outsiders need to eat and sleep.</p>

<p>There's nothing in the description which says that creatures with mortal ancestors who were born on other planes don't qualify. They only need "mortal ancestors or a strong connection to the Material Plane." There's nothing that says that every Outsider who happens to be a native of the Prime deserves the subtype, either; they need mortal ancestors, or another strong connection. I don't think merely being <span style="font-style:italic">born</span> in the Material Plane qualifies as a strong connection, and I don't think merely being born in some other plane removes that connection.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>. No half-demon can be banished from the Prime ever? Even though it was born and spent the first 500 years of its existence in the Abyss?</div></p>

<p>That half-demon <span style="font-style:italic">should</span> be a native outsider with the extraplanar subtype - so yes, you should be able to banish it back to the Abyss. </p>

<p>You're right that the description of the native subtype says that all natives are considered to be native to the Material, which technically means it should only have the extraplanar subtype when in the Abyss or other non-Material planes, but I think we agree that that's stupid. So, in this case I advocate contradicting the official rule. </p>

<p>Despite the subtype's name, all it really does is represent mortal traits the creature inherits from mortal ancestors - a soul and the need to eat and sleep. Our Abyssal cambion friend should have those traits (merely being born in the Abyss won't change that). </p>

<p>The native subtype should be considered to be entirely seperately from the extraplanar subtype. </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&quot;Bob the Efreet&quot;</em> wrote:</div>It's not just that. There are no outsiders. Couatl aren't outsiders. Hell hounds aren't outsiders. Baatezu aren't outsiders (although they do have an outsider-like type: exemplar).</div></p>

<p>I still think that's a horrible, masochistic idea. Why make the statistics for so many D&amp;D creatures invalid? Because the name "outsider" (like the name "native") happens to be Prime-centered? That makes it worth rewriting the stats for scores of monsters? Call all the outsiders "exemplars" if you want, but I don't see the point of recalculating all their skill points, hit dice, and feats. </p>

<p>The problem people had with the outsider type is a relic of early 3.0 D&amp;D, when all planar monsters seemed to belong to the same creature type (though this wasn't actually true even then - devourers, ethereal marauders, inevitables, and all celestial, fiendish, axiomatic, and anarchic creatures belonged to other creature types, among other monsters). </p>

<p>The introduction of the extraplanar subtype fixed that problem, and the native subtype fixed the practical (as opposed to theoretical) problems people had with planetouched. The vast Planewalker type-redesigning project has outlived its usefulness.</p>

<p>I don't mind just changing the planetouched around, or even the bariaurs - those are just a few creatures who are important PC races. But changing  <span style="font-style:italic">everything?</span></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>If that were true, the "native" subtype would be completely redundant.

<p>Because the native subtype was supposed to distinguish these creatures from the extraplanar outsiders, the so-called exemplars. It was meant to be applied onto the planetouched and half-whatnots, but as far as PW is concerned, the planetouched are humanoid (as they should've been in the first place), so yes, the native tag is more or less redundant. Unless you want Prime-born outsiders, like those mentioned below.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>There's no reason to assume that outsiders are extraplanar by default</div></p>

<p>Yet it was the assumption back in 3E, and that's why the extraplanar and native tags were introduced. The widely accepted - and wrong, yet supported by some spell description text - assumption was that outsider =&gt; extraplanar and vice versa. Hence, one of the few good additions of 3.5, the extraplanar subtype. And one of the many bad additions, the native subtype.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>It's not <span style="font-style:italic">my</span> rule; it's the official rule. </div></p>

<p>And as said before, this official rule is being circumvented by making the planetouched and similar races humanoids or monstrous humanoids instead of "native outsiders". </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Outsiders are defined in D&amp;D 3.5 as creatures "at least partially composed of the essence (but not necessarily the material) of some plane other than the Material Plane," which doesn't necessarily mean they're <span style="font-style:italic">from</span> an other plane.

<p>Rip, look, you're confusing the issue here. You say couatls and rakshasas are composed of the essence of Outer Planes, yet you use them as examples of creatures that have the native subtype, and are therefore Prime-related? </p>

<p>Look, the MM has "warm marshes" as the rakshasa's environmnt entry, and "warm forests" as the couatl's. They both have the native tag. On the other hand,the achaerai has Acheron as the environment, and the extraplanar tag (notice the lack of the native tag). They made the rakshasa and couatl "native outsiders" because they want them as prime creatures in 3E. They left the achaerai as an extraplanar outsider because they liked it on Acheron. See what I'm gettinmg at here? </p>

<p>Once again, for the folks in the back: There is <span style="font-style:italic">no </span>such thing as an extraplanar native outsider. The extraplanar (of the Planes) and native (of the Prime Material) subtypes are <span style="font-style:italic">mutually exclusive. </span></p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>I don't mind just changing the planetouched around, or even the bariaurs - those are just a few creatures who are important PC races. But changing  <span style="font-style:italic">everything?</span></div>  </p>

<p>I'd agree with you on this if Bob was right, but for what it's worth, I'm pretty sure he's wrong. The "change everything" option was an early design idea meant to handle the outsider problems in 3.0. The current planewalker stand on the issue is, AFAIK, make the planetouched, gith, bariaur, bladeling, and the like extraplanar humanoids, and leave everything else as is.</p>

<p>The "native outsider" is another way of saying "Prime mortal", and it is difficult to apply on these extraplanars. As I've repeatedly pointed out above, native outsiders can't also be made extraplanar, and *that's* why planewalker's way of handling things is better - it still leaves room for "native outsiders", but avoids the illogical concept of "native extraplanar outsiders" by making them extraplanar humanoids.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>A half-fiend born in the Outlands, visiting Toril. </p>

<p>Or a half-fiend born in Toril, visiting the Outlands.</p>

<p>If you want me to find an example in an official product, you're out of luck. You're not arguing with Xan here or someone else who cares about such things. My point is that this isn't that this is how WotC is doing things, only that is the way things should be, for a number of reasons. My point is that WotC has <span style="font-style:italic">bungled</span> their own rules in a really obvious, hideous way.</p>

<p>It's not just common sense, it's a game balance issue. Why should my rakshasa (or half-celestial, eladrin, whatever) character from Sigil not have to eat or sleep while your rakshasa character from Eberron does? Why should you be able to resurrect your rakshasa character from Eberron while I can't do the same for my rakshasa Cager? </p>

<p>This double standard twists the whole game out of whack.</p>

<p>Extraplanar means the character is not on its home plane. This subtype affects how certain spells effect the character.</p>

<p>Native defines the nature of a character's flesh and soul. You still haven't explained why being born on one side of a portal as opposed to the other should affect that. <span style="font-style:italic">Should</span> in the in-game sense or <span style="font-style:italic">should</span> in the metagame sense - it fails by both standards.</p>

<p>By the rules, incidently, the half-fiend from the Outlands and the half-fiend from Toril would both be (chaotic, evil, native, extraplanar) while on the Outlands and (chaotic, evil, native) while in the Material Plane, while an elf from the Outlands would be (extraplanar) on Toril and an elf from Toril would be (extraplanar) while on the Outlands. That's a stupid double standard all of its own, but it's not quite so bad as your interpretation: at least planar characters have the same bodies and souls as their prime equivalents, even if spells affect planar-born native outsiders in the opposite way that they should. I quoted the actual text of the rules; I'm not sure why you still don't believe me. </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Because the native subtype was supposed to distinguish these creatures from the extraplanar outsiders, the so-called exemplars.</div></p>

<p>For what reason? The extraplanar subtype already distinguishes them in that way.</p>

<p>The native subtype was invented so that people who wanted to play tieflings, aasimar, or genasi (or fey'ri or tanar'uks) in the Forgotten Realms setting could do so without significant complications. It was a hack of the game rules and there's no reason to read anything more into it that that</p>

<p>Don't get me wrong, it was a <span style="font-style:italic">good</span> thing, but there's no reason - either logically or by the official rules - that it shouldn't be as useful in planar campaigns as it is in the Realms.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>the illogical concept of "native extraplanar outsiders" </div></p>

<p>It's only illogical if you're hung up on the names. Forget about the names: I agree that the names are horrible. If I were choosing the names, I would probably call them "mortal extraplanar reifications," which isn't an illogical combination at all. That's what the names <span style="font-style:italic">mean</span>; it's just that whoever picked the names out was doing so from a confusingly Prime-centered point of view.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>The "native outsider" is another way of saying "Prime mortal"</div></p>

<p>No, no. Look at the actual rules. "native outsider" means "mortal exemplar" - native, regardless of the name, means the character has a soul like a mortal and their body has mortal physical needs. Outsider means the character has an (at least somewhat) spiritual body made from the abstract concepts of the planes of the sort that ordinarily wouldn't have a body/soul duality and wouldn't normally have mortal physical needs.</p>

<p>The line that says that native outsiders are always native to the Material Plane whatever plane they're actually from reads like an editorial afterthought, and makes no rational sense at all. Ignore it, is my advice.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Rip, look, you're confusing the issue here. You say couatls and rakshasas are composed of the essence of Outer Planes, yet you use them as examples of creatures that have the native subtype, and are therefore Prime-related? </div></p>

<p>No, I'm using them as examples of how WotC has misapplied the "native" subtype, presumedly because someone had the idea of how they could prove how versatile it was, but didn't really think about what on in Heaven's name the in-game explanation might be.</p>

<p>Do you have any ideas? </p>

<p>Rakshasas and couatls are outsiders, which means according to the official definition that they contain the essence of planes other than the Material Plane.</p>

<p>I don't actually have a problem with outsiders personifying the essence of the Material Plane. Presumedly such a creature would be the personification of sunlight, or nature, or the stars, or the crystal spheres and the phlogiston, or the space/time continuum. I don't think these creatures should have to eat or sleep, and I don't think they should have a soul/body duality. By the rules, these creatures have a connection to the Material Plane and they're outsiders, so they should be natives, but it doesn't make any sense to use the native rules on them.</p>

<p>Rakshasas and couatls personify flavors of evil and good, respectively. They're clearly outer planar, regardless of what the designers of the 3.5 Monster Manual thought.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Look, the MM has "warm marshes" as the rakshasa's environmnt entry, and "warm forests" as the couatl's.</div></p>

<p>There are plenty of those things on other planes. Even if they tend to be native to Material marshes and Material forests, it doesn't change the fact that they're not reifications of marshes and forests - that would make them elementals or fey, in all likelihood - they're reifications of good and evil, clearly lesser forms of fiends and celestials. </p>

<p>As I said, they're excellent examples of how the native subtype has been misused.</p>

          Aasimar is not native outsider?        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>First off: Outsiders eat and sleep. I don't care what the Monster Manual says, being outsider does not necessarily grant you immunity from these needs. Some outsiders like the baatezu have very unique patterns of sleep, other outsiders like the tanar'ri do not seem to need sleep. Both of these cases are documented in Faces of Evil, and as far as I'm concerned supercede the MM. It's a case by case basis.</p>

<p>I'd say the same thing applies to souls. I'd say half-creatures are outsiders but have souls, and I'd argue that some pure outsiders have souls. At the same time I'm not particularly sure why coatyls have souls, but then I've never interacted with one. In any case I think it's a bad idea to make a blanket statement about the condition of a soul based on monster type. If anything, the nature of the soul should remain a philosophical abstract. What about the Sons of Mercy who believe even the foulest fiend has a good soul buried inside?</p>

<p>Thirdly, we have NOT removed the outsider type. Exemplar is not a type, it is a word used to describe the true outsiders: fiends, celestials, modron, slaad, and anything else that we consider appropriate. While hell hounds are outsiders, I personally would not call them exemplar. And to that effect the term exemplar does not have a exact meaning. It's an incharacter word, whereas outsider continues to have both incharacter meaning and game mechanic rules.</p>

<p>By an large WotC has improved their stance on the issue since 3.0. The vast majority of creatures maintain the Outsider type, and I'm mostly willing to leave this as an individual DM choice. However, planetouched being outsiders...it doesn't work. Bariaur either. For starters, this would mean the majority of PC races for Planescape would have immunity to spells like <span style="font-style:italic">charm person</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">ghoul touch</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">hold person</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">reduce person</span>. It'd mean that they'd all have proficiency with simple and martial weapons (which, now that I think about it, may account for their +1 LA).</p>

<p>Some planetouched without those benefits might deserve not having a LA, but it doesn't seem like a good idea to grant so many characters these attributes.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

You're not arguing with Xan here or someone else who cares about such things. My point is that this isn't that this is how WotC is doing things, only that is the way things should be, for a number of reasons. My point is that WotC has <span style="font-style:italic">bungled</span> their own rules in a really obvious, hideous way.</div></p>

<p>Ah, so. Well, as long as we're talking about the way things <span style="font-style:italic">should </span>be ... </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Why should my rakshasa (or half-celestial, eladrin, whatever) character from Sigil not have to eat or sleep while your rakshasa character from Eberron does? Why should you be able to resurrect your rakshasa character from Eberron while I can't do the same for my rakshasa Cager? </div></p>

<p>As moogle said, outsiders eat and drink and sleep, or at least that's the way it <span style="font-style:italic">should </span>be. Being a native outsider should mean no more than that you were (somehow) born on the Prime Material, and thus your kind should not be considered extraplanar there. It is a type for outsiders only, and only those who are not extraplanar. It is obvious to me that this was the intention of the wizards' design team, and that the native subtype traits (eating, sleeping, etc.) were jammed in just to remedy the planetouched. </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Native defines the nature of a character's flesh and soul. You still haven't explained why being born on one side of a portal as opposed to the other should affect that. <span style="font-style:italic">Should</span> in the in-game sense or <span style="font-style:italic">should</span> in the metagame sense - it fails by both standards.</div></p>

<p>Should in the in-game sense: You are of the Prime. Your soul lacks certain properties that a true outsider's soul has. There is a dualism in your being, as you are not fully spiritual like your extraplanar relatives, nor are you equal parts sould and flesh, like the mortal primes. Your immortal kin either despises you (if fiendish) or feels compassion (if celestial). You belong nowhere. Go figure. I don't like it overmuch, but it can be explained.</p>

<p>Should in the metagame sense: In 3.0, customer service gets drowned in clueless questions about what can be banished by whom from where, and about outsider type implicating extraplanar "treatment". In the revision, the designers cleverly slap the extraplanar tag on the outsiders that should be considered extraplanar on the Prime, and the native tag on those who shouldn't. When someone asks "And what about the planetouched? They should have certain mortal characteristics." someone else replies "OK, just edit the native subtype." And they leave it at that, which would be fine if there were no extraplanar aasimars, tieflings, and half-outsiders. The intention was to make the extraplanar and native subtypes mutually exclusive. There is no clear mention of this in the rules, but nothing is mentioned about the good and evil subtypes being mutually exclusive either, yet we can safely assume they are.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>That's a stupid double standard all of its own, but it's not quite so bad as your interpretation: at least planar characters have the same bodies and souls as their prime equivalents, even if spells affect planar-born native outsiders in the opposite way that they should.

<p>It's not an issue of belief, I thought we were talking about how things should be, not what actually stands in the rules? I didn't write the native subtype, and we apparently agree that it's </p>

<p>What I'm trying to do is explain how the planewalker.com's interpretation works (well, my interpretation of their interpretation). The fact that the wizard's fumbled with the native subtype has little to do with the planewalker version.</p>

<p>Native is as relative as extraplanar. If you are from the Prime, you are native (and not extraplanar) there, and when on other planes you are extraplanar (not native) there. This stands for all creatures, not just outsiders, yet the extraplanar and native tags are added just to the outsiders because they are usually not from the Prime. </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Because the native subtype was supposed to distinguish these creatures from the extraplanar outsiders, the so-called exemplars.</div></p>

<p>For what reason? The extraplanar subtype already distinguishes them in that way.</div></p>

<p>For the reason of D&amp;D audience being a bunch of whiny little bastards that need to have everything spelled out for them, to show that not only is A equal to A, but it is not equal to B. Yes, it is superfluous to you and me and most planescape players. That's why planewalker threw its relevant portion out (the one applying to the planetouched).</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>the illogical concept of "native extraplanar outsiders" </div></p>

<p>It's only illogical if you're hung up on the names. </div></p>

<p>I'm hung up on the names because I'm trying to show how the designer's intent was to make the native subtype to distinguish between creatures extraplanar in relation to the Prime and native to the Prime. And how the "soul stuff" (eat, sleep, raise dead) was added later to compensate for the fact that the planetouched were still outsiders. If we eschew planetouched outsiders, we can eschew the "soul stuff" of the native subtype, which we both agree makes little sense.</p>

         <p>Rip pretty much said what I can say... </p>

<p>RAW, native subtype has nothing to do with whether an outsider is extraplanar or not. Native subtype allows an outsider to be raised/resurrected and requires him to eat/sleep, unlike outsiders without native subtype. </p>

<p>So suppose a rakshasa (native outsider) with Prime as home world travels to the Outlands. It could still be raised and still needs to eat/sleep even in the Outlands. Thus, it'd not lose the native subtype, thereby become native, extraplanar outsider. </p>

<p>So given this as the definition of native subtype, am I right to say that PW.com doesn't acknowledge native outsiders since they have all become humanoids or monstrous humanoids? </p>

<p>From moogle's post, it seems we are also removing true outsider's nature of not needing food/sleep...? </p>

<p>On a side note, are outsiders immortal?</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Exemplars (since I like the word), I feel, should be immortal where people believe they are. They are, after all, manifestations of belief. It'd be intriguing to have an exemplar grow old and die, though.</p>

<p>In a way, having exemplars eat and sleep adds a kind of eerie familiarity to the planes - 'creatures' with the same basic needs as all others, though they may respond to them in different ways.</p>

<p>It works symbolically, too - given the nature of the outer planes, exemplars would then feed upon belief.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Won't be necessary. I'll just state my opinion one final time and try to stay away from further arguments. </p>

<p>1) All official outsiders have either the extraplanar or the native subtype, but never both. Therefore, it is safe to assume that these subtypes are mutually exclusive. <br />
2) If that is so, than the only purpose of the "eats, sleeps, drinks, gets raised" traits in the native subtype description was to make the planetouched seem more mortal. If we remove the planetouched from the outsider type, these traits are no longer required, and the native subtype is therefore no longer required. It remains nothing more than a sign clarifying that the outsider creature is not to be considered extraplanar on the Prime Material Plane.</p>

         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&quot;Nemui&quot;</em> wrote:</div>As moogle said, outsiders eat and drink and sleep, or at least that's the way it <span style="font-style:italic">should </span>be.</div></p>

<p>I certainly agree with the premise that Faces of Evil should trump the MM. </p>

<p>Sleeping and eating is, however, a complicated, supernatural process for most outsiders. Yugoloths have to bury themselves alive to sleep. Tanar'ri never sleep, but exist in a constant hallucinagenic dreaming state. Baatezu sleep only when they're permitted to by their superiors. Fiends may feed on flesh, but they gain sustenance from abstract qualities like terror and hate. Buraqs gain sustenance from serving their virtuous riders. Sword archons never eat or sleep; warden archons eat, but don't sleep. Higher-ranking archons feed on things like the joy of petitioners. Slaadi eat, but what they gain nourishment from is the chaos they cause. </p>

<p>They gain sustenance from abstract qualities, but no outsider is going to <span style="font-style:italic">die</span> from not eating; at most, they'd go into a coma until revivified by some qualitity associated with their plane or alignment. I think of Dream of the Endless when he was trapped inside his prison; he still felt hunger and thirst (for food and water as dreamt by mortals) but he didn't <span style="font-style:italic">die</span>. I think most outsiders are the same way.</p>

<p>Native outsiders sleep and eat like mortals do, is the point.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div> Being a native outsider should mean no more than that you were (somehow) born on the Prime Material and thus your kind should not be considered extraplanar there. It is a type for outsiders only, and only those who are not extraplanar. It is obvious to me that this was the intention of the wizards' design team, and that the native subtype traits (eating, sleeping, etc.) were jammed in just to remedy the planetouched. </div></p>

<p>You're demonstratably wrong about that, Nemui. The native subtype was introduced in the Forgotten Realms Campaign Setting for the sake of the planetouched, in order to make them more playable. This was early on in the 3.0 edition of the game, long before the extraplanar subtype. It was only applied to the planetouched at first. Therefore, it couldn't possibly have been intended as a fail-safe counterpart to the extraplanar subtype. </p>

<p>It was probably in some ways a <span style="font-style:italic">predecessor</span> to the extraplanar subtype, doing things that the latter subtype does better. Now that we have the extraplanar subtype, however, the native subtype still does things the extraplanar subtype does not. There is now no reason that they should overlap.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Should in the in-game sense: You are of the Prime. Your soul lacks certain properties that a true outsider's soul has. There is a dualism in your being, as you are not fully spiritual like your extraplanar relatives, nor are you equal parts sould and flesh, like the mortal primes. Your immortal kin either despises you (if fiendish) or feels compassion (if celestial). You belong nowhere. Go figure. I don't like it overmuch, but it can be explained.</div></p>

<p>But... but... that doesn't explain anything! You repeated the <span style="font-style:italic">symptoms</span>, but not the <span style="font-style:italic">cause</span>.  The symptoms are that the character is born on the Prime and for some reason has a soul, but the explanation I was looking for was why those two things should be connected.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Should in the metagame sense: In 3.0, customer service gets drowned in clueless questions about what can be banished by whom from where, and about outsider type implicating extraplanar "treatment". In the revision, the designers cleverly slap the extraplanar tag on the outsiders that should be considered extraplanar on the Prime, and the native tag on those who shouldn't.</div></p>

<p>No, the simple lack of an extraplanar subtype suffices to identify those outsiders who aren't extraplanar. If you were right, the native subtype (as  originally conceived) would be completely redundant.  The WotC designers haven't shown any penchant for redundancy in their rules; they like things slick. </p>

<p>The native subtype is a hack for the sake of the planetouched. It was designed for the Forgotten Realms setting, not for a planar campaign. It was not designed to clarify the way certain outsiders respond to spells. It was designed to make tieflings and aasimar into better PCs. </p>

<p> As a result, it has some prime-centered biases in the terminology. As originally conceived, the idea may have been "planetouched born in the Realms are somehow different from planetouched born in the planes," but in the current rules there is <span style="font-style:italic">no</span> distinction between the two. </p>

<p>The only requirement of a native outsider is that it has mortal blood or some other <span style="font-style:italic">connection</span> to the Prime, not that it be from that plane.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>The intention was to make the extraplanar and native subtypes mutually exclusive.</div></p>

<p>The two subtypes do completely different things:</p>

<p>1. The native subtype alters the metabolism and thanatology of the character. It is objective, like the outsider type, and in effect no matter where the character goes. It modifies the outsider type.</p>

<p>2. The extraplanar subtype alters the way spells affect the character. It's subjective; it is present on some planes and absent on others. It modifies all creature types.</p>

<p>There's no reason at all that they should be mutually exclusive. To say a character is an extraplanar native outsider is meaningful. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Extraplanar Subtype:</span> The creature is not on its home plane, nor is it in a transitive plane. For example: an eladrin in the Abyss, a Torillian half-fiend in the Outlands, a githyanki in Limbo.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Native Subtype:</span> The character has a soul, though it belongs to a creature type that normally wouldn't. It has a mortal physiology, though it belongs to a creature type that normally wouldn't: instead of feeding on abstract concepts, it feeds on food. Instead of sleeping never, only when ordered to, or buried beneath the soil of Gehenna it sleeps like a mammal does. In a Prime-centered campaign, this would normally indicate that the character is from the Prime. However, the extraplanar subtype can trump this.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Outsider Type:</span> The character is the personification of some abstract concept. The character's body is made or partially made of spiritual matter.</p>

<p>See? The types and subtypes involved work fine that way. Observe their elegant dance! How they harmonize, like notes on a musical scale, like the spheres of the cosmos itself.</p>

<p>If I want to play, for example, a succubus that has been implanted with a human soul as a curse, <span style="font-style:italic">that</span> would be a great example of a native outsider. But what if I want my succubus to have spent eons on the Abyss before she was soul-implanted? The rules as you interpret them would prohibit my awesome character concept. Yet the rules as written define it so perfectly. What to do? Should I be awesome anyway? Yes! I should! I will assume that "extraplanar" trumps "native" and merrily play my awesome character the way I wanted to. </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Native is as relative as extraplanar.</div></p>

<p>Wait, you think the native type goes away when the native outsider is on another plane? So a rakshasa (lawful evil native) from the Prime becomes a rakshasa (lawful evil extraplanar) elsewhere? And before he had a soul and now he doesn't? </p>

<p>That's... not the case. The native subtype is objective. Reread its description.</p>

<p>Or are you saying you think that's the way it <span style="font-style:italic">should</span> be, or you think that's the way Planewalker interprets it? Either way, I don't understand you at all. Why ruin a useful rule by rendering it nonsensical? </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>For the reason of D&amp;D audience being a bunch of whiny little bastards that need to have everything spelled out for them</div></p>

<p>Subtypes are created because they have some specific meaning in the game. Instead of introducing a redundant subtype, any clarifications can be made in the description of the creature itself. </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Now who's sounding like Xan!?</div></p>

<p>I didn't say you were sounding like Xan! I said you were arguing with me as if <span style="font-style:italic">I</span> were Xan, or at least like this was the Arcadian Pony thread which was all about finding obscure examples of unusual uses of the rules and arguing whether or not they were relevant. I'm not interested in that.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>I'd have to disagree that native and extraplanar subtypes are (officially) mutually exclusive. Planetouched aside, couatls and rakshasa are also native outsiders. We know that extraplanar subtype can be gained or lost as one moves about the planes. If the same is true for native subtype, then...</p>

<p>1. A rakshasa can be raised on the prime, but not on other planes.<br />
2. A rakshasa needs to eat/sleep on the prime, but not on other planes. </p>

<p>Why would a creature's eating/sleeping needs be altered just because it's off-plane? And if a raise dead spell works on a creature, the spell works on it regardless of which plane it is on. These are the 2 qualities that distinguish native outsiders from true outsiders. This is the reason why native subtype is restricted only to outsiders, while extraplanar subtype can be applied to any creature type. </p>

<p>But since I understand PW.com to make the following changes....</p>

<p>1. Outsider Type: As written in SRD, except it may or may not need to eat/sleep.<br />
2. Planetouched: Change from native outsider to humanoid, monstrous humanoid, etc. </p>

<p>Given the 2 changes above, the only use of native subtype as a game mechanic is to make some outsiders like rakshasa and couatls "resurrect-able". I don't think too much is lost if these 2 creatures can no longer be raised. In this case, I think it's best to get rid of native subtype. </p>

<p>There is no need for native subtype if all the native subtype defines is the absence of the extraplanar subtype. (We have magical beasts with extraplanar subtype, but no magical beasts with native subtype.) And there would be no reason to restrict it only to outsiders.  </p>

<p>This brings me back to my original question in my earlier post - does PW.com still acknowledges the native subtype? </p>

<p>I'd suggest we scrap it altogether.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Yes. Generally, that's what having a soul means.</p>

<p>Other differences include the fact that tanar'ri don't sleep, according to Faces of Evil. They feed on terror more than substance. Succubi also feed on life energy like vampires do. A "native" succubus would have to sleep like a human (or possibly like an elf, if she had an elven soul), and would have to eat mortal food or die.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">
