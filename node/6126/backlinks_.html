And, like a bodily, physical cancer these lies begin within ourselves; a potential that waits within us all. You have only to whisper it and it begins, harmless at first like that single cell, but in the end leads to pain and death. Release it. You have only to release it, unlock that potential and spread its misery. </font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>&nbsp;</span>It’s just a tiny little thing, a single little lie: “I actually regret it you see, what I did to the solar, the Maeldur et Kavurik.” </font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></font></span></p><p /></p><p align="center" class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">****</font></font></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>&nbsp;</span>The Solar, one of the firstborn of Chronias, one of the shining beacons of the Sevenfold Burning Mountain, and one of the chosen heralds of the Lords of the Celestial Mountain, he looked down on the ravaged landscape that stretched out before him.

If there were to be a conflict there, directly, the Baernaloth would stand little chance of surviving intact… </font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>&nbsp;</span>Daru ignored the pain and continued in a cold whisper, “I have seen the future.

A future where they stare out at the planes through barred and buttressed gates, prepared for a siege that does not come, and too afraid of bringing it upon themselves to unleash their wrath on the unclean.” </font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">“They will watch as evil washes over the innocent. They will shed their tears till they have no more to weep with, and then they will rationalize their inaction with the words of the blindly righteous.” </font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">The Solar struck him across the face suddenly and swiftly, dashing him onto the ground, leaking blood and darkness. The Baern snarled bestially as he picked himself up from the ashen soil. But as he turned towards the Solar again and cleaned the dust and blood from his maw, there was not a glimmer of anger on his face. No, there was a look of smug triumph. </font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">“How quick you are to rise to anger and fury.

Before he had ventured down into the pit he had keenly felt that he was not being told all of the reasons behind his mission. There had been a subtle current of change in the hosts of heaven of late. Celestia had taken a number of seemingly unrelated and quixotic actions outside of the great crusade in Baator, the Guardinals had gone silent and abruptly withdrawn from the conflicts, and the Passions of Arborea had grown ever more bold as if they were preparing for something momentous in the coming weeks. On top of it all there was war in the Outlands at the very base of the spire as Neutrality had birthed another race of equal but opposite mores. </font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">All of creation had gone mad, and he was an island in the midst of it, trying to make sense of the chaos. Surely the fiend was not telling the whole truth, they rarely if ever did, but even if there was some glimmer of fact in what it was saying… perhaps it might not be too late to change the course of events. It was for the greater good after all. He was not consorting with evil out of any desire but to make things right, to impose a greater order and meaning upon the planes for the betterment and harmony of all creation. If harm came through this, it would only be to him, and he was willing to become a martyr if it would prevent what the fiend had spoken of. </font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">And so he stood there, a single tear dropping from his face and falling into the bitter soil below, and all the while the fiend caressed his face like a lover.

He said nothing, told nothing, tugged no strings but simply watched the sorcerers make their own decisions. It ended with a silver edged knife erupting through the neck of one of the two and being left to die in agony. Its last moments were spent looking up as its fellow vanished in the sudden glimmer of a gate. Amalak had opened it by channeled the power of his dying comrade to power the spell that would hurl him free of the fortress and tear through any anchoring wards the lawful fiends might have erected. </font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">And Daru smiled as the other arcanaloth bled out onto the floor and whispered its death rattle up to him, the darkness that stood there in the gloom. </font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">Daru turned, one deed accomplished, and slowly walked up from the underhalls to the topside of the fortress. The Gloom Father walked between the dead and the dying, the organized patrols of hundreds of Baatezu, and the remaining yugoloths as they were drug to the surface and executed one by one. Daru did nothing to help them as he moved towards the rippling mass that was the Maeldur et Kavurik. </font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">“Hello my old and dearest friend.

The neutral fiends had been taken utterly by surprise when the Relentless appeared through the portal that Lydzin had been given by a source in the courts of Bel. She’d never heard of her before, an Erinyes with the oddest white eyes. But she’d locate her later since this was a favor that she’d doubtless have to pay up on if she profited from it. But she pushed that out of her mind and returned to the present. </font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">The arcanaloths that had surrounded the creature that Lydzin looked down upon had gone mad with panic at their sudden attack, stunned and horrified for reasons unknown. Some of them had wept and screamed like children. They seemed incapable of accepting that they could have been found and put under siege. </font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>&nbsp;</span>Lydzin scowled at the weakness of the defenders as she stepped forwards and crushed the skull of an injured but still living Mezzoloth. </font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>&nbsp;</span>“…I have no idea what it is my Lady.” The second in command of the mobile fortress, the gelugon wizard Jeird-athaca said as his frost coated mandibles quivered in uncertainty. </font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>&nbsp;</span>The pit fiend circled the creature slowly, followed by a contingent of eighteen heavily armored cornugons that served as her personal bodyguards. The yugoloths had left no records in the fortress regarding the beast except for a book that had been carried by an arcanaloth who had died defending the creature. The book was blank, the magic that had been woven into it apparently cursed to prevent its contents from being read by any other than itself. </font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>&nbsp;</span>But between the insane ferocity that the ‘loths had displayed defending it, and the words that her source had given to her, Lydzin was intrigued. “Power to raise your status in the eyes of Baator. Power to put your name among that of the Dark 8.” That was what she had been told by her source. That and a location in Colothys. Despite her power and her millennia old knowledge, Lydzin was clueless regarding the beast. </font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>&nbsp;</span>She turned to the gelugon, “Gather several of the korachons and have them assist you in moving the creature from here to the Relentless.

Lydzin found herself continually walking out to the deck of the fortress and for hours staring at the massive bulk of the creature that they had found. During the hours that it had taken them to approach near one of the portals to Maladomini, she had pondered certain things. </font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">Whatever the creature was, it was clearly important to the yugoloths. They had defended the fortress like fanatics, but they had been completely outnumbered from the start. But whatever the thing was, it would be worth something to a great many people even if she didn’t yet know what manner of creature it was. </font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">And above, the Bells of Othrys chimed and called out their eerie siren song, seeming to whisper down from the jet vault above. Lydzin gazed up into the black and starless firmament and pondered her future, mulling over her options, as the Maeldur suddenly and without cause began to softly cry. </font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>&nbsp;</span>An hour later she found herself standing upon the deck again and watching the beast after having spoken to her immediate commander. She had told Nyruzalk, a pit fiend under the command of Dagos, that she had captured a high-ranking Tanar’ri alive. She gave no mention of the Maeldur, nor how she had gained details of the yugoloth fortress. Nyruzalk had ordered her to return immediately to Baator with her prize. </font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>&nbsp;</span>She chuckled as she recalled making contact with and offering the slimmest details of the event, the true event, to agents and subordinates of Levistus, Baalzebul, and Mephistopheles. Those three numbered the Lords of the two major factions in Baator’s infernal politics, and the most powerful independent and unaligned Lord. With luck she would spark a bidding war, prize unseen, and vault herself into a high-ranking position within their courts and out of the immediate play of the Blood War. Greed and ambition danced in her eyes. </font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>&nbsp;</span>And above, the Bells of Othrys chimed eerily, seductively, like the dark, mocking laughter of a god. </font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>&nbsp;</span>“My Lady?

The Relentless contained a number of mortal petitioners bound to great devices that allowed those with the petitioner’s true name to communicate with them. The devices bound to the petitioners then transcribed the messages, sealed them and inscribed upon them the name of authorized recipients and the location of the sender.

But orders were orders and they would return to Baator immediately. Executions of her own troops for suspicion of subterfuge would occur afterwards. Still, she was certain now to gain promotion for this given the interest of the Lord of the 9th. Looking down at the blob of flesh nestled in the basin they had constructed for it, Lydzin laughed and grinning up into the dark of the sky. </font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></font></span></p><p /></p><p align="center" class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">***</font></font></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><em>“There’s a condition.” “There’s always a condition – whether they tell you about it or not.

It could have sent itself home, it could have found safety, but it only wanted to forget. </font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">The Maeldur wept with joy as it hurtled towards the Styx, soon to be washed of the hell that it had endured for so long. He only wanted to rid himself of the things that he had been told, the miseries that he had seen, and the agony of his existence that bore him down like an anchor stone to the river below. He could not be truly free so long as he knew the things that had caused his fall. </font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">Enraptured by its impending release, it turned its mind to its saviors. And, with a thought, he cast them away to safety as heroes of the celestials that had seen fit to send them. They vanished as tears ran down the multitude of eyes across the Maeldur’s rubbery surface. Release was imminent as the river grew larger and larger. Then he saw them. </font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">The waters of the Styx rippled from the waiting forms of the hydroloths and there, first and foremost among the waiting fiends, he saw Daru. The Lie Weaver stood naked in the water, waist deep, his arms raised up into the air expectantly. Marraenoloths waited at the rivers edge in their skiffs and insectile mezzoloths guarded the banks, and there in the water the Baernaloth stood, smiling and laughing like a perverse mockery of a prophet awaiting a sign from the heavens. </font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>&nbsp;</span>His shouts of joy and tears of happiness became screams of terror as the Maeldur plunged into the putrid river. He tried to stop it, he tried to prevent it all from happening again, he tried… oh he tried… but the fiend was upon him instantly to plunge his head below the surface of the water, submerging him and stealing away his memories and his taste of freedom in a mockery of baptism. </font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>&nbsp;</span>And there as the Baernaloth forced him under the surface of the Styx, he looked up as the light from above faded, blocked out by the fetid river and the looming form of the fiend’s hand. Together, as his mind and consciousness began to drift away, it seemed all like a shadow descending upon him from above, like a wastrel descending out of the cloudless skies of the Waste to touch upon his head. </font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>&nbsp;</span>Daru held him under till the struggling ended, expunging the lies and truth alike, robbing him of all that he had suffered and all that he had recovered. And as it was washed away and the darkness swallowed up the Maeldur et Kavurik, Daru smiled skyward and looked down upon the eyes of the fallen angel with unmitigated pleasure. </font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>&nbsp;</span>“My creation, my child, I am so very pleased in you…” </font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></font></span></p><p /></p><p align="center" class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">***</font></font></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">The darkness lifted and the being who had been the Maeldur twitched his multitude of eyes and awoke. He looked up with blank confusion, unaware of where he was or even who he was. The sky was cold and black, a void in which he saw distantly a series of hovering, floating volcanoes all alone in the darkness. </font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">The Maeldur blinked again and focused on a kindly voice that seemed to address him. He looked around at the smiling, jackal headed sorcerers that stood surrounding him, all waiting expectantly. One of them smiled at him directly, his eyes white and snake-like, the others seemed to wait on his word, deferential in some way. </font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">“Greetings my old friend.

This makes the second such collection by Delemthar regarding the nature of one of the 13. Delemthar’s current whereabouts are unknown:&nbsp;</font></font></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>&nbsp;</span>Most known details regarding Daru Ib Shamiq, sometimes known as ‘The Lie Weaver’ and other times as ‘The Penitent Fiend’ come from Pihnmid’s Translation, an ancient and sometimes suspect collection of excerpts of the Book of Inverted Darkness. </font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>&nbsp;</span>This text describes one Daru of the clan of Baern, first among the fiends of the three glooms, and sires of the General of Gehenna. Almost always mentioned therein and in other sources in conjunction with Daru, is one Maeldur, or Maeldur et Kavurik said to have been a native of Mount Celestia before his fall from grace. All sources describe Daru Ib Shamiq as the prime instigator of this event, though the reasons and rationale differ wildly. </font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>&nbsp;</span>Pihnmid claims that this was due to Daru sharing some blasphemous truth with the being known as the Maeldur that caused the celestial to turn his back upon the heavens. Pihnmid may also have been Daru himself as some other sources have claimed, including one, ‘Gospel of the Thricefold Exile’, supposedly penned by a Shator high priest of Apomps. </font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>&nbsp;</span>This latter source refers to another Baernaloth, ‘The Blind Clockmaker’ as being the brother of ‘The Lie Weaver’. The exact wording used in this source does not necessarily imply blood relation, but it seems strongly hinted at. According to the Shator source, Daru, despite being one of the weakest of the group of Baern known as The Demented, has schemes and plans in place that stretch across the planes themselves and thousands of years into the future. Only one other, who is never mentioned by name, is described as having perhaps greater goals and more far reaching aims than the Lie Weaver. </font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>&nbsp;</span>To quote the nameless Shator author, “The so-called Penitent Fiend has spread a litany of deceptions about his own past and his own nature, many of them whispered into the ears of sages, wizards and scholars over the millennia to the point where they gain a libelous mass, turning them from utter lies into accepted truth. Simply put, nothing about Daru should be taken at face value, even more so than his other kin among the thirteen.” </font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">The Lie Weaver’s appearance is perhaps the most mundane of his other twelve kindred. He appears ancient, diseased, and physically wasted as if from the ravages of time and atrophy by inactivity. Daru’s only overt physical flaw is his apparent frailty and a dry, rattling, intermittent cough. For one of his kind he seems weak, average, and terribly, terribly mundane. Lies upon lies, deceptions upon deceptions, a thin veneer above a living blasphemy. </font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>&nbsp;</span>When taking another form, Daru generally keeps only one vestige of his true self: oddly white or clouded eyes save for an unusually small pupil, regardless of what race’s form he wraps himself in. When taking these forms he never presents himself as anything more than what he would appear to be; nothing special, nothing noteworthy; average. When found in his true form, always when he wishes to be found in that form, he affects a persona of apathy. He may claim to be tired of existence, oddly regretful for his past actions, not repentant truly, but wishing to take some things back now that they have served their original purpose. He has even gone so far as to fake his own death at the hands of those seeking him out to further this deception as ‘The Penitent Fiend’. </font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>&nbsp;</span>For those seeking him for reasons varied and ill advised, Daru is said to lair somewhere in either the Gray Waste or Gehenna, with some obscure sources claiming that he posed as mortal for many years in the gatetown of Torch. The minor estate said to have been his, now a crumbling but well-known ruin, is known as Daubei’s Obscure Woe. Little is left, though local legend claims that ghosts, or ghost fiends haunt the structure, something impossible according to all scholarly knowledge of the subject. </font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>&nbsp;</span>There are also claims of an intermittent portal somewhere in the ruins, supposedly leading to Daru’s lair wherever it actually exists upon the planes. But despite this being true or not, no natural animal will lair in the vicinity of the ruined estate. Additionally, while clerics detect no evil rising above the background of the region’s vicinity to Gehenna, they uniformly feel that something is simply… wrong… in the locality. </font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>&nbsp;</span>But regardless of these questions, Daru is true to his name: The Lie Weaver. A word here, a name there, selling half-truths and subtly seeding falsehoods into otherwise truthful material; the fiend has ruined otherwise virtuous and powerful men, perverted nations, created strife where there was none before, and been a blight unto the multiverse since of old. But of course, he does not do these things himself, he allows others to do it themselves of their own free will, unknowingly acting by proxy for him. Of all the things that are suggested regarding the Lie Weaver, there is no direct evidence to place the hand of a master archfiend behind any of them. </font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">There is such a temptation to place the Baernaloth at the heart of a master conspiracy of Evil upon the planes, simply to absolve us of culpability in any heinous act. It would be so terribly easy to do the things we do and push blame onto this outside source and wash our hands of the matter entirely, and therein the Lie Weaver would win another victory as we slide towards the pole of evil by our inaction and failure to take responsibility for what we ourselves have done. </font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></font></span></p><p /></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span>&nbsp;</span>But even for those things that Daru Ib Shamiq seems likely to played a part in, to set the stage for what would come, to plant the seeds of evil in fertile soil, as Madam Opus in Sigil might say herself on such matters, “Alas, I cannot prove a word of it.” How fitting that a treatise on The Lie Weaver might be itself sprinkled throughout with just so many falsehoods. </font></font></span></p></p>   </div>
