</div> <p>My personal views on how Urban Planescape should look and feel. <br />
You'll notice that I took some creative liberties, such as destroying the Forgotten Realms in a sidenote (it felt <span style="font-style:italic">good</span> :twisted: ), but generally did my best to keep the text as broadly defined as possible. <br />
Feedback appreciated. </p>

<p>---------------------</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">NOT SHADOW</span></p>

<p>The <span style="font-style:italic">Urban Arcana Campaign Setting </span>rulebook states that the world has changed, that "<span style="font-style:italic">magic has suddenly become very real, and creatures that before were only found in fairy tales and nightmares now walk the streets</span>". Humans in the know explain that the "<span style="font-style:italic">walls between reality have become thinner</span>". This is true enough, though the term they use to describe the fantastic creatures coming from elsewhere is a misnomer. These new beings should not be collectively referred to as "Shadowkind", even though some few of them may indeed hail from the Plane of Shadow. They are simply planars, come to this world through trans-planar portals.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">EARTH FORGETS</span></p>

<p>See, this Prime Material Plane, known to most as Earth, was once connected to many other planes - Outer, Inner, Transitive, and even alternate Primes. However, the magic of Earth has long since diminished, due to complex cosmological circumstances, and the planar connections were severed. The elves, ogres, demons, and the rest were locked out - not that many of them took any notice. Earth has forgotten, as both the fantastic creatures and the magic became myth... Nevertheless, the magic eventually came back, and the planars followed. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">EARTH REMEMBERS</span></p>

<p>Within the past few years, certain organizations have noticed a steady growth of magic potential in the world. Some of them have used the short time they had to prepare for the opening of the ancient cross-planar portals that soon followed. Gradually the portals reactivated, and humans of Earth stepped back onto the planes for the first time in hundreds of years. Soon enough, the first few planars passed in the opposite direction, bringing their varied influences into the mix. <br />
Now, the Prime Material Planes, including Earth, are generally not considered an interesting destination for planewalkers - the popular belief is that there is little to see and less to do on the Prime. Still, many planars recognized an opportunity in exploiting the plight of a world that, until recently, was almost entirely devoid of magic. Traders, belief-hunters, and various opportunists have slowly been passing over the planar boundaries and onto Earth, all looking for their piece of the cake. <br />
The assumption in Urban Arcana is that the majority of Earth's human population had somehow managed to subconsciously ignore the presence of the planars (the "shadowkind"), but this is plainly wrong. It is clear to all but the truly clueless that the mythical beings are no longer mythical, and that magic is real again. While different regions of Earth choose to deal with these facts in different ways, shutting our eyes is no longer an option. For better or worse, Earth is once again a part of the multiversal society.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">MEANWHILE, ON THE PLANES...</span></p>

<p>So, what has been happening out on the Planes while we were out of the loop? Where to begin... </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold"> - Sigil: </span>Let's start at the hub. The Cage has changed, but not beyond recognition. It's still torus-shaped, the Lady is still in charge, the dabus still speak in pretty pictures, the Powers still can't come in, and various factions are still trying to prove that their belief systems are superior to everyone else's. Other than that, well...<br />
The air is somewhat less breathable, although it never was much to begin with. The Ditch is still greenish-brown, the Hive is still a dung heap...<br />
The architecture is still blade- and spike-oriented, although usually glass and metal are used in place of stone and wood. <br />
Communications have improved, the messenger guilds replaced by a network system utilizing both magic and advanced technology. Apparently, the Lady now mazes even those that oppose her will on the web, so consider yourself warned, b3rkz.<br />
Small gas-powered vehicles have put the sedan chairs out of business long ago, but relatively recently the subway lines were finally activated, and the traffic on the surface has become bearable again.<br />
The denizens still come in all shapes and sizes, Some claim that the City has been slowly growing in radius throughout the past few centuries, as more and more primes, planars, and proxies keep drifting in (and, eventually, out).<br />
The Kriegstanz is still on, and it is still a tricky game of bluffs, backstabbing, and base betrayals, but a new key factor has appeared - the media. The several information networks are closely involved in the faction game, and their importance is recognized by all parties. The influence of major networks extends far beyond the Cage, usually across the Outlands and even into the first few layers of some Outer planes, though it is somewhat diminished on the Inner and Prime planes.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold"> - Outer Planes: </span>Even though some gate towns and layers have been slipping across the borders and back, all the thirteen planes of the Great Ring (including the Outlands) are still in their place. All have changed to some degree over the centuries, particularly the regions populated by mortals. The divine realms and exemplar domains are also evolving, albeit more slowly. Despite the technological discoveries that have made transport faster, lives easier, and weapons deadlier, belief is still the name of the game in the Outer Planes: the Chaos is still chaotic, the Law is still lawful (more so, if anything), the Blood War is still raging, kept in motion by the kindly celestials, and the rilmani are still tiresome meddlers.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold"> - Inner Planes: </span>These realms have not changed much. Energy and Element care little for the fleeting achievements of blood, bone, and sinew. What little change there is can be found mostly in foreign settlements: the dao and dwarf mines of Earth are modernized and more efficient than ever; the City of Brass has imported many of the wondrous technological novelties from the Outer and Prime planes; the ancient four Citadels of Entropy are now a single multi-planar military complex, working at full capacity. Speaking of which, within the past century or so, some Inner Planes have seen a dramatic increase in independent refugee settlements; many Primes are seeking shelter on Air or Water after their worlds have been destroyed or rendered inhabitable at Critical Point (see "Alternate Prime Planes" below).</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold"> - Transitive Planes: </span>The Astral, Ethereal, and Shadow have seen little change since the days of sword and sorcery. Unconfirmed rumors mention "informational demiplanes" forming spontaneously in the Silver Void, possibly as a byproduct of heavy traffic on the widespread communication networks. In the Deep Ethereal, most khen-zai domains have fallen, their mass genocide project failed. The Shadow is better explored, although still sparsely populated. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold"> - Alternate Primes: </span>There are too many Prime Material planes in existence to address individually, and little can be said in general about their historical progress. <br />
One thing worth mentioning is that certain Arcadian historians have concluded that most Prime planes currently seem to be near what they referred to as Critical Progress Point (CPP). CPP represents a relatively short period in the development of a mortal civilization during which it obtains enough power (supernatural, mundane, or both) to destroy itself, but not the required degree of sophistication to harness that power effectively. Typically, Prime civilizations that survive their CPP become stable and prospective, while those that don't usually send their Prime Material plane into a long slump, after which a longer recovery may or may not follow. Examples include the Prime worlds of Athas and Abeir-Toril, the former still slowly recovering, the latter just starting its post-apocalyptic downward spiral. <br />
Earth's chances of survival are still unclear, and one could argue that much depends on the degree of success in the current process of reintegration into the Planes. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">MODERN BELIEF </span></p>

<p>Divine Powers still roost on the Outer Planes, as distant as ever, feeding on mortal faith and demanding respect. It is difficult to estimate how much the recent "urbanization" of the planes has affected them. On one hand, they still maintain their little realms in much the same way they've been doing for countless centuries, and petitioners are still regularly created to populate those realms. On the other hand, many Prime worlds (Earth among them) went through an era of rationalization, where deities have been more-or-less discarded as outdated concepts... On the third hand, a number of Prime worlds (not to mention the Planes) still have a visible presence of interventionist deities, and engage in traditional worship. On the fourth hand, who can really say when it comes to the Powers?<br />
One more thing: In the previous century, a new trend of divine worship quickly became fairly popular on the planes. Powers with similar portfolios but from different pantheons are being lumped together into single entities with varying avatars. Thor is Zeus is Indra, or some such. An offshoot of the old Athar faction calling itself "Unifying Chorus" is promoting this viewpoint, and whether they are wrong, right, or still-wrong-but-becoming-right (what with the belief-shaped reality and all) remains to be seen.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">MODERN MAGIC</span></p>

<p>As said before, magic exists. Due to obscure planar alignment, some Prime Material Planes have experienced a temporary decrease in magical potential, similar in effect to the nullifying trait of the Spire. Earth's "downtime" is over, and the magic potential is there again, waiting to be rediscovered. On the Planes, magic was present all this time (and still is), but is no longer omnipresent - in time, the planars learned ways to shape the world according to their needs without (much) magic, through (mostly) mundane means. The rise of technology on the Planes was not as meteoric as it was on Earth, since it was easier (and still is) to achieve some things by simple magic than by complex mundane science. Still, spell-slingers are not found at every corner, planar travel can be achieved with little or no magic, and mundane means of mass destruction have the advantage of being much cheaper and more easily obtained than their arcane counterparts. <br />
Even though general education is readily available, magic theory and practice is rarely, if ever, taught at public schools, while the basics of modern science usually are. As far as magical education is concerned, an institutional course, as opposed to individual apprenticeship, is the norm these days for those gifted and fortunate enough. In spell-slinger guilds and other magical societies, the trend is standardization and collective progress, and strictly individual pursuits are discouraged. The result - fewer powerful mages and priests, and more powerful organizations. Still, some spell-slingers see this reduced and less versatile competition as an opportunity for the ambitious. <br />
The above mainly applies to learned, mortal magic and psionics. Native magic- and psionic-users, such as the exemplars, dragons, illithid, and others, did not change much; it is still easier to use your inborn powers than to adapt to mundane means, however tempting the technological wonders may be.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">MODERN TECHNOLOGY</span></p>

<p>A human planewalker from Earth will probably not be particularly awed by the technological achievements of the planars. Almost any mundane equipment that can be found in the Cage or on the Planes exists on Earth in one form or another (and vice versa). The design of planar tech may seem unusual to an earthling, sometimes even bizarre, but the basic effects are fairly well known in most cases. Exceptions exist, but on those rare occasions when the planewalker encounters flying cars or disruptor ray guns, the items are usually made by combining magic and technology. <br />
In fact, it is well known that complex technology and complex magic do not mix well, nor easily, so magic items are never mass-produced in factories. Some will say such difficulties are to be expected when combining methods based on fundamentally different principles, but some will say just about anything. As said before, examples of magically empowered tech and mechanically infused arcana have been recorded by reliable witnesses, and some of them didn't even explode, either.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">MODERN PLANEWALKING</span></p>

<p>Right then. So, after answering the where, how, and what with, only the why remains. Why does an Earthborn turn to planewalking? What's in it for him? A number of things, actually: </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">- Motive One: See the Worlds </span><br />
They are infinite in both size and number, the Planes, and each one very much, but not quite entirely, unlike Earth. The curious and the adventurous might want to explore these brave new worlds simply because they are there. Those who visit M. Estevan of the Planar Trade Consortium can easily get a job escorting shipments of lesser importance - the PTC is always on the lookout for clueless primes, you know.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">- Motive Two: Protect Your World </span><br />
Many see the new frontier as a threat, whether potential or active. Earth-based organizations with an interest in the supernatural - Department 7, Shizuka Ni Ugoku, and many others - are looking for capable and open-minded agents, primarily for scouting missions. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">- Motive Three: Live Your Belief </span><br />
Your mind shapes reality, albeit on a miniature scale. If you join others who share your beliefs, anything is possible. The Kriegstanz is still active throughout the Planes, even on this backwater Prime world: emissaries of various factions and sects (by now, the difference is purely academic) are recruiting. Find one that suits you, and he should set you up with a task to prove yourself dedicated to the cause.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">- Motive Four: Gain Personal Power</span><br />
There is more to life than this. The horizons of humanity are being broadened, and rapidly. Those who ride the wave will be the movers and shakers of the new age. Those who don't will be forgotten. The ambitious will seize the day, jump the portal, tumble to the chant, survive, grow, and prosper. Where there is will to power, there is a way.</p>       </div>

It's not "modern," but it shows a direction that I think it is good.</p>

<p>Nemui's scheme doesn't go quite far enough for my tastes; simply using Planescape as it is with more advanced non-magical technology kind of misses the point, to my mind. I'd like to see more things like <a href="forums/viewtopic.php?t=507" class="bb-url">the Endless Sewers of Erebus</a> - modern mundanity made mythical; the planes rendered nearly unrecognizable.</p>

<p>And no, I don't think any of the things I've written on this forum have gone far enough either.</p>

<p>I really like the idea of Critical Point as a recurrant theme.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Nemui, who do you see as being responsible for the monitoring of each individual Critical Progress Point on each Prime world?</p>

<p>I'd like to see a kind of inter-planar bureau of scholars responsible for cataloguing every world and their progress up to and beyond the CCP. Of course, the Arcadian historians might be enough for this though... </p>

<p>The scholars would have to be extremely impartial... agreeing to an oath of non-interference since there are likely to be a few members who would want to act in order to ensure the transitional period is as "bloodless" as possible. There may even be some who wish to halt a world's progress or divert it so they are spared the effects of the CCP.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>The thing is, I was trying to make room for a degree of continuity between the old and new Planescapes, leaving things as little defined as possible. The new planes (Erebus, Atomic Hades, what have you) are supposed to fall into this setup easily. I'm fine with "rendering the planes nearly unrecognizable", but you have to explain what happened, since most people playing UPS will be familiar (to a extent) with how the planes worked in the old PS setting. You can turn Arborea into the Land of Stories, but you have to explain how and why it happened.</p>

<p>Re: The CPP thing. I wrote that more or less accidentally, since I was listening to Stereolab's <a href="http://stereolab.koly.com/songs/lyrics.php?lid=105" class="bb-url">Ping Pong</a> while typing <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/smile.png" title="Smiling" alt="Smiling" class="smiley-content"/>  I don't see the planars as overly concerned for the fate of the primes, particularly the immortals that had probably seen things like this happen before. It's a natural (sic) cycle. "Ka is a Wheel, say thankya".<br />
If a campaign needs a presence of celestial interventionists, sure, but I wouldn't accentuate it too much.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Eh, I dislike doing away with the Astral War and Shadow(not the Plane of Shadow, Shadow), as they kinda define the setting to me. Of course, the Urban Arcana-Astral War-Urban Planes line is only one of the many ways the planes could have been modernised, and the most important thing about this project is letting DMs use planescape with a modern twist, so we should really have a few different ways for the planes to get there(preferably(sp?) with most not even involving Earth, as there are plenty of players who'd object to that sort of thing), and include them all in the download.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I like both, although I lean more toward what Nemui suggests because it fits with a setting I'm writing (I can't have an Astral War due to a lack of Githyanki... [grumble grumble]) </p>

<p>In my setting (a sifi one) elves, dwarves, ogres, etc. are actually aliens, so a lack of magic doesn't prevent their existance. I can't decide on an explination for elf/dwarf/etc legends, though. I have two choices...</p>

<p>1): When magic did exist, they used it to travel to earth (as humans did to travel to other worlds) </p>

<p>2): they never existed of earth, but have entered our legends due to the fact that memory isn't entirely limited to flowing with the timestream (something like this happened in a book I read, but I can't remember the title...)</p>

<p>I like the bit about magic dropping off for no specific reason, I may use it in my setting</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>So, let me get this straight - this idea of the "Urban" planescape is a debatable process that doesn't go far enough - basically becoming something like planescape but with Earth and earth-like technologies more present - or it goes to far - resulting in something that isn't planescape at all?</p>

<p>Why not just smash "Alternity" and "Planescape" together? I mean, it would give enough technology and alienesque touch, but still retain the more mythical/mystical/magical realist elements of Planescape? I guess that might not be going far enough... </p>

<p>My other concern I suppose is - why has no one brought up anything like Cyberpunk or Steampunk? If someone has, please let me know! I mean, both genres could well apply to Planescape, relatively easily too, for a more modern setting. Take the Anime "Sakura Taisen" - machines combined with demons (in a biotechnological sense) or just demons attack the world of Earth (circa 1920s) from another dimension (basically...), but Earth is defended by actresses/opera stars/show girls in Steam powered armor suits that function off of the energy of their souls using steam powered weaponry (particularly, a steam-powered Bazooka!). Of course, this is just an example of what could be done with and or to planescape in order to "modernize" or "urbanize" the setting...</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>One thing for me is that I really dislike the idea of an "Earth" or single primeworld where technology and modernism spread from.</p>

<p>Primes probably often call their worlds by similar names, or don't have names for their prime at all.  Also remember most primes and prime worlds might never see the outer planes.</p>

<p>The way I see it is a modernized Planescape setting is one where enough primeworlds have developed (and begun to believe in) technology to influence the outer planes to change.  It happens little by little with tech seeping in all the time (Mines of Marsallen in Acheron, &amp; ect.).  This does not mean that there are no sweeping changes on the planes.  In fact it would make sense as the industreal revolution seems to have followed a similar path in several instances around the world.  </p>

<p>Basically, normal Planescape is the setting before most modern technology and thought has reached a break even point.  A point at which enough primes (and planars) believe in the ideas enough that the tech works well enough to be truely useful on the planes.  In normal Planescape there are technologically advanced Primes and Prime worlds, they may even be fairly common, but they are not the majority and even if they are belief takes time.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>To be honest, I agree with you - its just that I am also impressed by the enthusiasm for an Urban Planescape. Also, which prime material plane do you think would have advanced far enough for the technology to come from? My money is either on Cerillia or Athas (Cerillia in time I believe would discover technology like Earth has and Athas lacks the religious interventions against technology - besides the Psychic Dragon Kings <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/tongue.png" title="Sticking out tongue" alt="Sticking out tongue" class="smiley-content"/> ) I would have suggested Mystara, but that would also imply that the Savage Coast becomes... not savage.. or something... Maybe all the technology just comes from the Spelljammer campaign setting? Afterall, it really is the most far along next to Planescape. Of course, I would consider a everflaming scythe (stick that can make a scythe blade of flame appear without need of charges or being recharged) as advanced technology and they are supposedly common place in Sigil! I guess what people consider advanced technology versus Modernization is very different.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>In other words the Tech itself is nothing new.  It is the idea and its use that is new.  It is the paradime of urbanization and industry that is new.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Mystara had a high tech level - including nuclear reactors - thousands of years ago, during the era of Blackmoor. Its gnomes have, in the present day, created WWI-style biplanes and flying cities with their own "fantasy physics" technology.</p>

<p>I agree with Gerzel (and Dante). There are a lot of places in the various D&amp;D worlds for advanced technology to come from. You could argue that Sigil could be transformed <span style="font-style:italic">tomorrow</span> if its planewalkers stumbled on the right portal.</p>

<p>Why not have all (or most of) the worlds advance together? Urban Oerth, Urban Krynn, Urban Aebrynis could all be sub-settings.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>In other words the Tech itself is nothing new.  It is the idea and its use that is new.  It is the paradime of urbanization and industry that is new.</div></p>

<p>Actually, you make a great point. Although, from what I've seen on the forum, most people are going with the idea that the technology is either new or from earth (generally speaking). Though, I think it would take such a massive paradigm shift on the prime worlds in order for Planescape to be affected with the same paradigm change. Although, a lot of the weaponry and stuff on Planescape I would consider to be much more advanced then “modern” stuff like a gun. I mean, seriously – who needs a tape recorder (even a digital, forever-lasting ion battery-powered tape recorder) when you've got a mimir? No batteries, records everything and all you have to do is ask for what you want and it finds you that information - so long as the mimir has any information on what you asked about.</p>

<p>Hmm.. good point. Actually, in most D&amp;D campaign settings, Gnomes are the most technologically advanced in a mechanical, engineering, non-magical (not always) sense.</p>

<p>Your absolutely right! If we urbanized the Prime worlds first, then urbanization of Planescape would be so much more simpler and I like the thought of sub-settings. This even gives Urban Planescape a much broader ground to work with. However, what of Spelljammer? I mean, regardless of the other campaign settings – it is as sci-fi as D&amp;D gets – without crossing over into Alternity.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p> I'm currently writing a crossover between Planescape and Star*Drive (Alternity's flagship setting), and one thing I'm having to look into is the effects that the modernization of the Planes, as well as the influx of technologically-developed offworlders, has on the established Prime spheres.</p>

<p> Of course, I'm also trying to figure out the interaction between driveships (and other technological spaceships) and spelljammers.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>IIRC, this is the idea. However, Urban Planescape assumes that a player character is either an Earth prime or a planar. It's easier to use modern Earth as a parameter for building the modern planes than to update each and every D&amp;D setting (at this point). </p>

<p>Just a question of priorities, IMO. Planescape implies adventuring on the planes, and we don't need to know the exact progress level of Mystaran gnomes for that.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I sorta favor the idea that the modernization stems from a single prime, and came almost overnight.  A sudden, jarring change.  I'm not particular at to which prime is the source.  <br />
Logically, it would start in Sigil, and then spread from there.  Some Prime sets up shop selling modern firearms, amo, medicine and consumer goods at affordable rates (for planars.  Back home, the prices woud be exorbent, due to the metals he is being paid in).  Word spreads, the some among the Golden Lords sees an opportunity, finds the source of these commodities, and starts buying in bulk.  The market becomes saturated (in Sigil), so they begin to sell to major planar groups.  <br />
In Hell, Bel, always on the lookout for new advantages in the Blood War, realizes how useful modern firearms are, and begins to develope the infrastructure nessisary to mass produce them.  Observing the power and the ease and efficiency of it creation, and begin to duplicate the processes they witness.<br />
In Hades, the 'loths would begin to develope the infrastructure they need to produce weapons and arms, which they would probably then sell the Hell and the Abyss or use to equip their own mercenaries.<br />
In Limbo, some slaad would start using modern goods, others wouldn't.  Infrastructure would be shaped from the soup when needed, and allowed to dissolve back into chaos when not.<br />
In Arborea, medicine and consumer goods would provide the impetus for change.  Eladrin on Pogo Sticks comes to mind.<br />
In Elysium, beneficial goods, like medicine and sanitation, would be embraced.<br />
In Celestia... same as Elysium and Arborea I guess.<br />
However, the single most importent event in the Great Reboot.  The sudden appearence of the infrastructure needed to support the full extent of modern technology almost overnight would rapidly spread to the other planes, advancing their infrastructure to similar levels.  Prior the Great Reboot, infrastructure would only really develope on the lawful planes, and then only to the level of the early industrial revolution</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p> See, I very much like this idea-- it throws the arrogant Planars for a loop and serves as a reminder that Primes and Prime worlds can be <span style="font-weight:bold">important</span>. Since the Planars still have a vast magical edge, of course, this shock doesn't last long.</p>

<p> Having a more-or-less centralized source of the modernization also allows for a certain dramatic contrast, as you can compare Earth Primes to the Primes from other worlds, or the Out-of-Touch (or even Out-of-Town) for whom the new technologies are still somewhat baffling. The similarities between arrogant Planars and arrogant Earth Primes can also be a source of either humor tension, depending on how it's played.</p>

<p> It also gives a counterpoint to Sigil, having a second central location that massive plots can revolve around-- possibly with heroes finding major plots that are caught between the two worlds.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

          Urban Planescape, My Take On        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>What draws me to the Urban Planescape Project is the great addition it would be to the D20 Modern game. I'm also drawn to the projects complexity. In my opinion , Urban Planescape can't be just fowarding TSR's Planescape storyline a couple of millenia and adding D20 Modern's earth as another destination for an enterprising Planewalker. Urban Planescape should benefit from the same foundations as Planescape ; I'm sure most agree with me. </p>

<p>If I was to write Urban Planescape I wouldn't mention Earth at all. I don't think Earth is of any consecuence to such a multiverse. We would crawl back to old world arrogance if we placed Earth prominently within the Multiverse. I would use the D20 Modern Rules to govern play. I would use the same character class system and allow the non-human races as playable characters within the class system.</p>

<p>I dare not mention storylines because I admit I'm still lacking some general story knowledge from the planescape line ( i haven't read all the books). But I will share my thoughts as they surface.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">
