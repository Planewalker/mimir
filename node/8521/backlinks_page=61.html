         <p>Ya'shenn attempts to contact the Portmaster's mind for a moment.  <span style="color:darkblue"><span style="font-style:italic">~The port still stands</span></span>, she observes dryly.  Of course, both she and Portmaster Ib'm are undoubtedly aware that that had been a near thing.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>Benyamin</em> wrote:</div>He politely asks a few questions of the Git'ribani outside about their journeys and the events that led to their appearance in Starmantle, occasionally maneuvering the conversation toward their next port of calling.</div></p>

<p>The psion is quite cordial and polite to the newcomer, but -- especially once she realizes his association with the Band of Silver -- scanty when it comes to actual useful information.  This Xer'mun already seems more observant and patient than many of Gith's children.  Between these two things she might reasonably wonder, privately, what sort of associations this newly-come warrior might have with the Silver Eyes.  The psion might indeed <span style="font-style:italic">love</span> to be able to improve relations where the Eyes are concerned, but she, as well as others in their <span style="font-style:italic">rrakkma</span> band, had quite literally just given offense to none other than Mist-of-the-Mind herself.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>Benyamin</em> wrote:</div>I offer my blade and council in service of the People on the Black Fleet as a sign of brotherhood from Silver. May the sons of Gith move as one to the aid of our siblings.</div></p>

<p>Hopefully this was an idea on the part of Gish Lis and not Mist-of-the-Mind's doing.  In contrast to Ii'Jyka'Vaar, Ya'shenn seems politely interested in the newcomer, but she does not yet speak.</p>

<p>[Actually, I'll do a Sense Motive as well.  Would like to get a general read of the commanders following the meeting, and of Gish Lis and his sub-commanders in particular.]</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Azthri'zhan'kel makes note of what proceedings she is allowed to witness, though more often than not she finds herself in the role of observer. Withdrawing a worn, leatherbound journal, she begins sketching warband insignia, adding notations concerning colour and warband name if applicable and does the same to any pirate insignia for further record. She glances up as Xer'mun speaks, wondering what stories he could tell of adventures long gone.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>[Gather Info on ships crew composition and attitudes]</div></p>

<p>Ii'jyka'vaar sets herself to the task of finding out who's who in the Black Fleet.  Lehr'Asj'tor the Onyx is convinced he is in dept to Ii, for Master Pale would be well within his rights to claim him as a deserter (which he is, having fled Pale soon after the Queen's fall).  As a member of the Black Fleet himself, Lehr knows much about the other crew, and about recent developments.</p>

<p>Styrrn left with most of his core officers, about a dozen githyanki.  The crews of the ships are mostly graith, with squads of githyanki enforcing Styrrn's orders.  Since he fled, the graith crews are going to be sizing up the remaining githyanki even more than usual.  More blades, whether from Sigil, the Astral, the Underdark, or Baator itself will be welcome.</p>

<p>Still, Styrrn, and through him githyanki rule, has been beneficial to the pirates; the wealth of sacked cities and the githyanki fleets' dominance of the sea lanes have conspired to make the pirates of the inner seas, masters of their world rather than the hunted wolves they were, when strong navies sought to protect the trade routes.  Styrrn was shrewd, for a graith not to mention a githyanki, and read others well, whether it be allies or enemies.  The graith captains of the five best sloops-of-war can be counted on (after a fashion) as can Styrrn's First Mate, the graith pirate Red Dread.</p>

<p>Red Dread was captain of the <span style="font-style:italic">Pride</span> before the incursion.  Styrrn defeated her in single combat, but spared her (alone of the entire ship's crew, it is said) making her his right hand when it came to running the ship.  Though she has been openly contentious with Styrrn, she has carried out every order.  There might be a danger of her wanting the captaincy back, but she has learned to fear and respect githyanki blades.</p>

<p>Of githyanki blades, only a few remain after Styrrn's departure.</p>

<p>There are only two Duthka'gith; Khem the Sharp (very dragonish looking, very skilled in battle), and Av'dra the Dun, a mind-warrior fond of daggers and having a reputation for ... consorting with graith too closely.  Indeed, there are three graith half-dragons among the crew who are loyal to the half-gith-half-dragons.</p>

<p>The most prominent of the pure-blood githyanki is Varsh-Mil.  It is said he "held a dagger" for Styrrn, and is likely feeling rather betrayed right now.  As a Varsh-caste teacher of the young, he is skilled in all three arts; mind, magic, and blade.  He has the habit of speaking to others as if they were children, especially the younger githyanki, but his skill and knowledge cannot be denied.  He is band of turquoise and worked at many Varsh'isk connected to Githmir and other major cities on the Astral, and is very well-traveled and cultured.  Varsh-Mil is especially disdainful of the graith, and there is mutual dislike between him and the duthka'gith. </p>

<p>Another Turquoise from Githmir is Gav'jji the Swift.  He is the most able sailor and navigator among the githyanki, rivaling the best the gaith have to offer.  Why Styrrn left him behind is anyone's guess, but it is fortunate for the fleet.  It is known that Gav'jji had turned renegade and joined a crew of gith pirates well before the incursion, but had proved himself true githyanki when Toril was invaded.</p>

<p>Shar'shau is more interested in money than most githyanki.  He has the best rapport with the graith pirates than any other githyanki, understanding them on a level other gith cannot.  He was a smuggler in Git'riban for a time, but also joined the incursion when it was launched.</p>

<p>Xailen the Brewer has a tea house in Starmantle, and may be reluctant to join the fleet in this endeavor.  Lehr is confidant that Ii'jyka'vaar can convince him, though.</p>

<p>Mlar-Kav'natch is a master artificer.  She is quiet and interacts seldom with Lehr'Asj'tor, so he knows only a little about her.  She was not fond of Styrrn, especially his advances, and Lehr believes she chose to stay instead of accompany Styrrn.</p>

<p>There are six Swordwraiths aboard the Sloop <span style="font-style:italic">Raven's Claw</span>.  As undead, they no longer have their mind-powers, and cannot dimension-door.</p>

<p>A psion, K'rr'jakak of the Voidwalkers, is a psychoportation specialist who transports the swordwraith into battle.  His personality is very intense, even manic, and Lehr avoids him as much as he can (which isn't enough, as a teleporter, K'rr can be anywhere he wants, antagonizing whomever he wants)</p>

<p>There are a few younger warriors, rank-and-file githwarriors whose officers were slain.  They amount to twenty or so.  They tend to follow the lead of whatever ranking githyanki is present at the time.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

Withdrawing a worn, leatherbound journal, she begins sketching warband insignia, adding notations concerning colour and warband name if applicable and does the same to any pirate insignia for further record. She glances up as Xer'mun speaks, wondering what stories he could tell of adventures long gone.</div></p>

<p>As Azthri sketches designs, she notices an insignia embossed onto the shoulders of Xermun's armor, close enough to be a clasp for a cloak or simply a warband badge: A silvery eye stands upon a field of black, while a double-edged blade slices down the center and serves as the iris. This is not the normal identification for the Band of Silver. Not as obvious but easily seen are the ceremonial wrappings around Xermun's arms. <span style="font-style:italic">Tir'su</span> inscriptions scroll across each band in what appears to be psionic ink, proclaiming- <span style="font-style:italic">Xermun gi'Ij'akzul, Rish-i-Ghaik of the Silver Stalkers, rish of the Ullitharid...rish of the Tamer....</span></p>

<p>Xermun would have briefly acknowledged the young Gith during the interlude before the leaders adjourned. His conversation seemed fixed on the more veteran members of the Blades of Git'riban and their stories of forming a rrakkma and their fight against Illithid House. Du'minh, being one of the earliest and one of Sight's slayers, becomes his most invested discussion.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>Zimrazim</em> wrote:</div>The psion is quite cordial and polite to the newcomer, but -- especially once she realizes his association with the Band of Silver -- scanty when it comes to actual useful information.

Between these two things she might reasonably wonder, privately, what sort of associations this newly-come warrior might have with the Silver Eyes.</div></p>

<p>Should Ya'shenn  notice his Order's badge, the image might scream allegiance to the Silver Eyes. However, if a member of the Eyes, why wear such a conspicuous sign? Why such ostentatious wrappings?</p>

<p>[Zim, Xermun hasn't addressed Ya'shenn for the same reasons as Ii'Jyka'Vhaar. I figured she was with the Council when he introduced himself to the Git'ribani outside the Customs House.</p>

<p>There are no graith even on the fringes of the githyanki crowd (they know better), but plenty of unfamiliar githyanki, some without obvious warband insignia, abound.  </p>

<p>The Commanders are getting their fleets in order and briefly concurring with each other.  Lahar's forces get set to move out quickly.  It is now known that he can transport three thousand githyanki, but currently has only three pilots for every two ships.  The Ruby and Garnet forces are the largest, but will likely be ready to move before the Black Fleet.  The Silver have several small, fast ships in addition to an Astral Brig and a few Astral skiffs.  His forces are likely to reach Urmlaspyr first.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>Azure</em> wrote:</div>Ya'shenn hears his mind send to hers ~ I don't know that this honor was bestowed truly to honor Na'rai, Ii'jyka'vaar, and Kirath. Still, 'Boots wander the battlefield where they may.' and this course of action may prove itself.</div></p>

<p>Gy-Nath can easily sense some amusement from Ya'shenn over the mental contact.  </p>

<p><span style="color:darkblue"><span style="font-style:italic">~I did observe that none of the other commanders seemed eager to absorb the Black Fleet into their own numbers.  It has occurred to me that the Black Fleet may serve as a left-handed reward, as well as a test.  Firebringer Lahar is a bit fond of tests, I think.  What more ironic reward for defying Pale than command of a crew that I might call 'questionable' or 'unreliable,' and that blunter githyanki than myself might call, and </span>have <span style="font-style:italic">called, 'scum?'  </span></span></p>

<p><span style="color:darkblue"><span style="font-style:italic">~...If you are at all concerned about my ego or pride?  Although I do wonder whether or not I should read a deliberate slight into the matter... I did not seek out the position that Ii'Jyka'vaar and Kirath currently hold, nor am I so inclined in the first place.  Considering what we already know of the Black Fleet, at least one or two duel challenges from the crew are a likely possibility -- something that Ii'Jyka'Vaar, in particular, would meet with pleasure.  I do not yet know Na'rai of Jade well, but I do not believe she is another Pale.  Kirath and Ii'Jyka'Vaar are both likely to give consideration to my advice, even if they do not always heed it.</span></span></p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&quot;Azure&quot;</em> wrote:</div>Gy-Nath greets Xer'mun briefly but very formally. He introduces himself as Kith'rak of the Blades of Git'riban, and introduces the other members of the war-party. Githees Ii'jyka'vaar, he mentions last. Already she is talking to a Black Fleet githyanki she met their first day at the Customs House.</div></p>

<p>Naturally, Ya'shenn notices how Gy-Nath introduces Ii'Jyka'vaar last, and manages not to smirk at that small but consistent discourtesy.  Even though she values Ii'jyka'vaar far more highly than she once had -- indeed, many times over, given the knight's unexpected willingness to defy Pale.  </p>

<p>While she doesn't stare, it is easy (especially for Xer'mun, no doubt) to follow the psion's gaze as it takes in the badge and carefully reads the <span style="font-style:italic">tir'su</span> on his wrappings.  </p>

<p>Once etiquette permits, the psion bows very politely.  <span style="color:darkblue">"It is a pleasure to meet a <span style="font-style:italic">ghaik</span> slayer so celebrated, one before whom Tamers cower."  </span> <span style="font-style:italic">Azthri'zhankel will be overjoyed!  Ha!</span>  <span style="color:darkblue">"It must pain you to be separated from the Underdark for any length of time.  No doubt one such as yourself has many stories to tell; I would be delighted to hear such, as time permits."</span></p>

<p>In truth, Ya'shenn is more wary than that.  Xer'mun is apparently here with the blessing of his commanders... and not all githyanki would be quick to associate with the scum of the Black Fleet.  True, their group had been on <span style="font-style:italic">rrakkma</span> until interrupted by a skipping portal.  Gish Lis had been willing to go against Mist-of-the-Mind's wishes, which had been heartening, but she cannot be at all sure of this newcomer's purposes or politics, other than a very likely association with the Silver Eyes.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Ii'Jyka'Vhaar makes a mental note to let the Duthka Gith to Du'min, as she isn't particularly interested at all in the church of Tiamat and her cronies..</p>

<p>She asks Lehr'Asj'tor to send several messages for her, as she doesn't want to burden Ya'shenn with her needs and wants..</p>

<p>Whilst she send s him on errants, she first has him buy some writing equipment for her, so she can write notes to be send.. Whilst he is then send on correspondence missions, she chats away with the smaller gith who are not affiliated, trying to sense their motives and see how she can use them in the fleet..(1st roll of gather info)</p>

<p>She asks Lehr'Asj'tor to find out who is currently running operations on the Raven's Claw, if anybody.. (2nd gather info roll)</p>

<p>She also has Lehr then send a message to both Na'rai and Kirath.<br />
In this note she states; <br />
~<span style="font-style:italic">"I have no intention of wanting to own or dominate the fleet as a whole, nor do I see myself ruling the "Pride", I do however have interest in running ship on board the "Raven's Claw",I hope we can come to a mutual agreement that is beneficial to us all in the coming period of cooperation that we will see ahead..<br />
Githees Ii'Jyka'Vhaar"</span>~</p>

<p>Another note is then send to Shar'shau;<br />
~<span style="font-style:italic">"I would like to have word with you, for I would like to see your use continue on board the ship I hope to command, and would like to see your expertise come to fruit for us.. any time you are able to meet me, please do so as soon as your able, as we have a short schedule and are supposed to sail soon.<br />
Githees Ii'Jyka'Vhaar"</span>~</p>

<p>Yet another note, this time to Gav'jji the Swift;<br />
~<span style="font-style:italic">"Gav'jji of the Turquoise, although I can see your proficiency and mastery of the skills of sailing and navigation as useful to the fleet as a whole, I would like to see you handle such things from the ship I hope to command, please let me know your thoughts on this topic as soon as is convenient.<br />
Githees Ii'Jyka'Vhaar"</span>~ </p>

<p>Ii'Jyka'Vhaar then proceeds to go to the address of the tea shop of Xailen the Brewer, hoping she can find him quickly, and have a chat.., notifying Lehr'Asj'tor that she will be there if he needs to find her for reply messages and such..</p>

<p>Whilst walking through town she muses about what she could want/ do with Mlar-Kav'natch the Master Artificer and the six Swordwraiths and K'rr'jakak of the Voidwalkers, who are resident on board the ship she covets..</p>

<p>The githyanki pirates around seem to be speaking with each other in hushed tones about the change in leadership.  A few quickly leave on their own errands, and others come in to inquire what want on.  The general mood is uncertainty and apprehension.  Those that come in, inquire, then leave again, genrally move off in the same direction down the warfs.  Likely, the Black Fleet is having its own meeting somewhere in the port.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

Before leaving to deliver the dispatches, Lehr informs Ii that the teashop is in a stone building  a short walk from the Customs House.</p>

<p>(back to that later)</p>

<p>The Githyankis' business proceeds apace.  Lahar's forces move as one to a point a couple of miles out to sea, leaving him his personal Brig to catch up in.  The gesture is intended to allow Pale to move out first.</p>

<p>The Silver fleet githyanki prepare to move quickly.  It is not lost on the other githyanki, though none of the other Silvers bid Xer'mun farewell, he is obviously not hurried to leave with them.  Indeed, as Gish Lis turns to the new commanders and the Git'ribani, he lets them know that since Xer'mun is "well known" to their own Psion, they can send important messages through him.  He then consults for the last time with Lahar, Raa-shiis, and Gish Zjaa.  Other Silvers similarly join with the other commanders' forces.</p>

<p>*Kirath*</p>

<p>A duthka'gith steps up and introduces himself to Kirath &amp; Ar'dru {DM: Come Back Az!}  He is extremely dragon-ish, and could as easily be taken for half-human or half-lizardfolk as for half-gith.  He speaks in perfect githyanki, though.  He is Khem Brun'ally the Sharp, of the Black Fleet.  He is joined quickly by another duthka'gith.  She is very different, and instead of Khem's red scales, her skin is ashen grey.  She has large swept-back horns over her dreadlocked hair.  Her face is not dragon-ish, but her teeth are very sharp.  She is Av'dra the Dun, a mind-warrior. </p>

<p>They politely inform them that the githyanki of the Black Fleet are holding their own conclave about their next moves.  Many of the highest ranking remaining are meeting at a local githyanki tea-house.</p>

<p>*Ii'jyka'vaar*</p>

<p>Gy-Nath intercepts the Knight before she can leave.  <span style="color:darkblue">"You are already taking your charge, I see.  I still believe we must return to Sigil as soon as possible, and joining this Black Fleet seems the best option to find the portals we seek.</span></p>

<p>{DM: If Ii'jyka'vaar wants to go to Xailen's tea-house, Gy-Nath and most of the party will accompany her.  Players are free to accompany too.  We just got the party back together, wouldn't want to split it again now}</p>

<p>*Ya'shenn*</p>

<p>Ya'shenn sees Gy-Nath intercept the knight as soon as the black fleet githyanki she spoke with left her.  Ya'shenn's instincts tell her something is going on, and evolving quickly.  Kirath and Ar'dru are speaking with two strange duthka'gith.  Az'thri stands eagerly sketching insignia.</p>

<p>*Xer'mun*</p>

<p>Still sensing happenings on the periphery of the group as well as the groups of commanders, Xer'mun Sees Gish Lis plant a Silver in each of the fleets to help coordinate their efforts.  The Silver are the smallest fleet, the fastest, and the most ready to depart immediately.  They will undoubtedly arrive in The Dead Stones first.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, several more "black" gith slip down the street and disappear into an alley a couple of blocks to the west.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>Zimrazim</em> wrote:</div>
While she doesn't stare, it is easy (especially for Xer'mun, no doubt) to follow the psion's gaze as it takes in the badge and carefully reads the <span style="font-style:italic">tir'su</span> on his wrappings.  </p>

<p>Once etiquette permits, the psion bows very politely.  <span style="color:darkblue">"It is a pleasure to meet a <span style="font-style:italic">ghaik</span> slayer so celebrated, one before whom Tamers cower."  </span> <span style="font-style:italic">Azthri'zhankel will be overjoyed!  Ha!</span>  <span style="color:darkblue">"It must pain you to be separated from the Underdark for any length of time.  No doubt one such as yourself has many stories to tell; I would be delighted to hear such, as time permits."</span></p>

<p>In truth, Ya'shenn is more wary than that.  Xer'mun is apparently here with the blessing of his commanders... and not all githyanki would be quick to associate with the scum of the Black Fleet.  True, their group had been on <span style="font-style:italic">rrakkma</span> until interrupted by a skipping portal.  Gish Lis had been willing to go against Mist-of-the-Mind's wishes, which had been heartening, but she cannot be at all sure of this newcomer's purposes or politics, other than a very likely association with the Silver Eyes.</div></p>

<p>Xer'mun seems to acknowledge the psion's perusal and remarks with courtesy. Xer'mun returns the bow respectfully. <span style="color:grey"><span style="font-weight:bold">"It is an honor to meet a true <span style="font-style:italic">ralisk</span>. Your bold decision echoes through the streets. Few would have rode ahead of Onyx to ready the People. I do miss the hunt, but the silver winds shift as they may. It is the duty of my Order to serve the People wherever the foul <span style="font-style:italic">ghaik</span> worm their tentacles.</p>

<p>I would be glad to share accounts of past hunts, as well as hear more of your own."</span></span></p>

<p>Ya'shenn can tell he is genuinely impressed by some action Yashenn or the Git'ribani have made. Was it her choice to fly with the Knight to warn Starmantle? Or to ally with the Firebringer against Pale? Or both? If she chooses to focus on his demeanor, she will read that it is a real compliment and likely both.</p>

<p>When he has the chance, the hunter gives Kirath a knowing look and bows the deepest he has yet. His voice rings boldly through the din as he says, <span style="color:grey"><span style="font-weight:bold">"<span style="font-style:italic">Sarth</span> Kirath of Copper, may your blade never falter. The People will not soon forget the might and name of the Copper Ring."</span></span></p>

<p>Despite being alert to the situation around him, Xermun truly pauses when he says this to Kirath. The undertone of his words floods with the mutual understanding and honor shared by veterans of terrible battles. The Darkfields still burns fresh in the slayer's mind.</p>

<p>Xermun positions himself to follow Gy'nath and the Knight should they leave. He continues his vigilance and neither moves to bid Silver off nor add to Gish Lish's words. If the leaders do not head for the tea shop, the giph will take his leave and follow the few "blacks" who are still making their way to wherever they are going.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>A simple act that speaks volumes.  <span style="font-style:italic">I am well repaid for saving this lot from impressment and eventual undeath.

Gish Lis is certainly aware that the Git'ribani already have a telepath among them.  As usual, Ya'shenn controls her expression, but she wonders whether any passing psion can sense her anger even from a considerable distance. </p>

<p>Once Gish Lis turns away, she speaks with Xer'mun again.  While the psion's tone has not exited the bounds of courtesy, it is less warm than it had been.  <span style="color:darkblue">"You are a very courteous gith... Coordinator.

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>The Crowd of Githyanki is beginning to break up, and Lahar bids the Git'ribani farewell for now.  The Garnet and Ruby forces of the red fleet are the most numerous, but thanks to Ya'shenn's and Ii'jyka'vaar's early warning, ready to take to the sea.</p>

<p>Ii'jyka'vaar leads the way to the teahouse, having been informed by Leyr'Asj'tor where it can be found.  Kirath and Ar-dru are similarly led by the duthka'gith, trailing the rest of the party.  It is a walk along the warf for a good distance before turning up the hill at a small cross-street between warehouses.  Up the hill a short distance, the street splits, going around a small promontory of bedrock.  Along the right-hand fork, built right up to rock, is a large stone building of the same material.  It may have been an inn at one point, but now it is roofless and partially ruined.  A wooden door still stands at the ground floor, but it is hacked-at and burned, and currently wide open.  In the doorway a small knot of four githyanki are present.  The party is walking up the hill, and the githyanki duck inside before they arrive.</p>

<p>{ DM note: party now consists of; Ii, Ya'shenn, Azthri, Kirath, Ar'dru, Du'minh, Na'rai &amp; Sthar, Gy-Nath, K'tch, Sark'ja, Ha'kanaa, and Kitiir }</p>

<p>The party enters the partly ruined building.  The rubble has been cleaned up so that there is a large empty space, turning what was the interior into a walled courtyard of sorts.  There is a small door down a flight of steps to one side that seems to lead into the rock itself.  There are a few githyanki here in the front parlor.  Indeed there are a few tables and benches, as well as an abused bar counter.  A pair of githyanki step out and share drinks with a couple of those out here.</p>

<p>The githyanki here are githwarriors from the <span style="font-style:italic">Pride</span>.  Varsh-Mil is one of those who came out to serve the others, and he will dominate any conversation.  He can tell the caliber of those he deals with very quickly, complementing their gear, their order, or their warband, in such a way as to let it be known that he has a sharp eye and a quick mind.</p>

<p>Another githyanki steps out of the cellar with a tray of beverages.  He is Xailen the tea-brewer.  He introduces himself to the newcomers, and invites them to come below and get a cup before he quickly goes back in himself.  He will return in a few minutes with another tray, and Varsh-Mil will inform anyone who is inclined to follow him below that there is no need.</p>

<p>Mil knows the actions of the commanders, and who Na'rai, Ii'jyka'vaar, and Kirath are.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Unlike Ii'Jyka'Vaar, Ya'shenn is not yet aware of all the interesting little details about the crew of the Black Fleet that the knight knows.  Still, she does what she can.  </p>

<p>In stark contrast to the <span style="font-style:italic">githees</span> (once again...), Ya'shenn calmly sips her tea and thanks Xailen politely for the beverage.  While she has no reason to suspect poisoning or drugging, she tries to determine whether fierce pirates might not slip something 'extra' into such a seemingly innocuous drink, for their own intoxication.  She also takes the time to gauge the relationships between these githyanki of the Black Fleet:  who are the most dominant of the crew present?  Who seems to like or dislike whom?  The psion is visibly fascinated by Ii'Jyka'Vaar's strong reaction to what, to her, appears to be a polite and intelligent <span style="font-style:italic">varsh</span>.  </p>

<p>Perhaps Ii'Jyka'Vaar is actually more perceptive than Ya'shenn would normally give her credit for?  The psion decides to keep this Mil occupied for the moment.  Her battle-sister had given her no signal to follow.  </p>

<p>Ya'shenn catches Mil's gaze and, if need be, introduces herself, very politely and without either fanfare or self-deprecation.  <span style="color:darkblue">"You have heard of all that has transpired, yes?  I am quite curious about your present plans, as well as those of your battle-brethren.

Still, considering how forcible impressment tends to..."</span> the psion cannot help but smile (and for a moment her eyes are alight!)... <span style="color:darkblue">"<span style="font-style:italic">not end well</span>, I doubt that conscription needs to be a concern for the crew of the Black Fleet.  I do hope we can come to an agreement that all parties find adequate." </span></p>

<p>A simple act that speaks volumes.  <span style="font-style:italic">I am well repaid for saving this lot from impressment and eventual undeath.  Perhaps I should have left them to their respective fates.</span>  At least it does much to explain Xer'mun's presence.  She had begun to warm to him, too, Eyes or not.  Gish Lis is certainly aware that the Git'ribani already have a telepath among them.  As usual, Ya'shenn controls her expression, but she wonders whether any passing psion can sense her anger even from a considerable distance. </p>

<p>Once Gish Lis turns away, she speaks with Xer'mun again.  While the psion's tone has not exited the bounds of courtesy, it is less warm than it had been.  <span style="color:darkblue">"You are a very courteous gith... Coordinator.  I'm sure you will be welcome among this group.  One can hardly refuse a dedicated <span style="font-style:italic">ghaik</span> slayer."</span></div></p>

<p>Xer'mun's eyes firm for a moment before he answers her civil response to Gish Lish's words. <span style="color:grey"><span style="font-weight:bold">"The Blades of Git'ribani have made a name for themselves on this Prime among the People, however short they have been here, though all noble sons and daughters of the Liberator are due respect. It is the way of the Void, as a <span style="font-style:italic">Tu'narathi</span> knows. However, I am merely a Second to a true <span style="font-style:italic">ralisk</span> as a Double-Edged Mind. I am but a voice to Silver, while you have the mind to speak even to the Firebringer himself. The role of Coordinator is still yours." </span></span></p>

<p>Xer'mun bows slightly to end the conversation in a formal fashion. His tone betrays no slight in his words. The giph, however, has referenced the fact that Ya'shenn is "well known" to the Firebringer, perhaps in an effort to appease the offense or as a reminder that the Git'ribani have made a splash with their appearance in Starmantle that the Fleets haven't fully processed yet.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Varsh-Mil simply smirks at Ii'Jyka'vaar's rudeness.  When she walks away he continues to converse with Ya'shenn and the others.  He is civil and well-spoken, with an abundance of personal charisma (and an overabundance of physical beauty).  There is a slight air of arrogance about him, though, as may be evident in the highly knowledgeable.  As a teacher/trainer he is appalled at the upbringing of the native Sigilans, but he is just polite enough to express it with sympathy instead of distain.  </p>

<p>His demeanor changes somewhat when Kirath and the duthka'gith enter.  He glowers at them, and quotes scriptures of Gith against the worship of powers and the mixing of gith and non-gith blood.  He does not speak to or confront them directly, though, except to acknowledge Kirath briefly as "Warlock" { DM note, he would have greeted Ii'Jyka'vaar and Na'rai first, and formally, when the Party arrived. }</p>

<p>*Ii'jyka'vaar*</p>

<p><span style="color:orange">"Well, I admit that 'not being executed by a Knight of Vlaakith' has recently become very high up on my list of motivations.  You wish me to sail with the fleet, Githees?  I'll not refuse, certainly.  In fact, I have been preparing for this."</span>  Xailen replies.  </p>

<p>He does not reply to Ii's suggestion that they speak alone, however.  She looks around and sees that there are more githwarriors in here, drinking tea.  There is a large hearth with three different huge cast iron kettles on the fire.  Situated around the room are a number of skulls and severed heads of various graith races, mostly hanging from the rafters in nets.  There are also a huge collection of herbs, both hanging and ground up in glass jars.</p>

<p>Before Ii'Jyka'vaar can say anything more, Xailen grabs one of the kettles and pours her a tall mug, using a small screen to strain out the herbs within. He garnishes it with a leaf from one of the hanging herbs.  The drink is hot and aromatic, and is perhaps the most delicious beverage she has had ... well, ever. </p>

<p>{DM note: The 'damage' to the building is old and pretty much cleaned up, indicating that this building was taken from the graith by force either during the incursion or somewhat afterwards.  Xailen will offer a brief explanation to this effect should Ii ask again, but she would realize the damage was not new.}</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Ii'Jyka'Vaar is a little frustrated that he doesn't go into more detail as to why he would so easily join the fleet at her request, if it is indeed to her request at al, if not her rank and position. </p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">~"why mention the execution edict of Vlaakith?... He must be becoming personally thus advanced in power that he has to worry about Vlaakith's old edicts perhaps still being carried out by those in power or those who wish to enforce that old edict for their own agendas???..."~ </span> </p>

<p>She muses that thought as she sips the brew she has been given, momentarily forgetting her earlier request, as it stands, when her thoughts return, she isn't bothered about that anyway, plenty of time on the fleet to do so again....</p>

<p>She says to Xailen; <span style="color:green"><span style="font-weight:bold">"Your brew is very nice indeed, it's refreshing to enjoy a brew without worrying if it contains any alcohol.., do tell me the story of this building and how it got into your "possession" if you would be so kind, and indulge me also in perhaps enlightening me , is your non refusal, because of my specific request, or because of my position/ rank?."</span></span></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>*Ii'Jyka'vaar*</p>

<p>Xailen smiles and nods to Ii'Jyka'vaar.  <span style="color:orange">"Your position is an intimidating one.  Look at you, a heavily armed harbinger of death, riding a war-wyvern, flies into port.  When Mil told me the Black Fleet had a Knight, I thought "Well, would I rather wait for stories of this foray, or see this adventure myself?"  The adventure won out, so It's free tea til we travel, since I can only take a few casks with us."</span></p>

<p><span style="color:orange">"As for the teahouse?  It was a graith tavern before we came.  Starmantle was conquered easily, but there were some pockets of resistance.  This building is in a defensible position, with an ample amount of supply storage, kitches, bed, etc.  You get the picture; it was commandeered by the graith guardsmen for defense.  I was one of the sarth in the assault here, and I admired the building and the fact that was still ... mostly ... intact.  So, with the help of some cohorts we cleaned it back up a bit and made it a teahouse.  The door into the rock there is still stout as ever, and keeps graith thieves out of my herbs whenever I'm away.  I keep the burned front doors as a warning.  I trap 'em if I go anywhere for more than a day.  The windows, too."</span></p>

<p>Xailen seems pretty nonchalant for having admitted to fearing Ii blades.  Fear may be why he decided to sail, but he says so with a shrug and keeps pouring tea.</p>

<p>Another githyanki slips up behind Ii'Jyka'vaar so silently and quickly that she is not aware of him until he speaks.</p>

<p><span style="color:indigo">"Like Xailen, I thought to myself "Shall I see misadventure for myself?"  Styrrn thought not.  I, on the other hand, think this will very interesting."</span></p>

<p>Ii'Jyka'vaar turns to see a githyanki shorter than most.  His hair is completely white (almost unheard of among githyanki, and he may dye it so) that frames his head like a lion's mane; no braids, beads, dreads, pins, tails, or anything (also unusual for githyanki).  He looks older than most other githwarriors here, including Xailen and herself, but his mannerisms betray an overabundance of energy.  He only comes up to Ii's chin, and he measures his height against her with a wide grin.</p>

<p><span style="color:indigo">"Your position IS impressive.  Your rank?  Well, I don't think anybody cares very much around here anymore.  The Black Fleet has a non-traditional command structure, as more befits being pirates, outcasts, thieves, and scallywags.  Styrrn commanded though a combination of ruthlessness, guile, diplomacy, intimidation, and tactics.  You certainly have the intimidation down, and your diplomacy seems pretty good so far.</span></p>

<p>Xailen re-fills this other githyanki's mug, but with a combination of herbs unlike what he gave Ii.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Xailen smiles and nods to Ii'Jyka'vaar.  <span style="color:orange">"Your position is an intimidating one.  Look at you, a heavily armed harbinger of death, riding a war-wyvern, flies into port.  When Mil told me the Black Fleet had a Knight, I thought "Well, would I rather wait for stories of this foray, or see this adventure myself?"  The adventure won out, so It's free tea til we travel, since I can only take a few casks with us."</span></div><br />
Ii'Jyka'Vaar keeps impassive as he recants impression of her and the fleet.. when he mentions th etea, she replies; <span style="color:green"><span style="font-weight:bold">"It will be good to have your brews on board the ship, and I will make sure you have ample opportunity and resources available for your brews whilst we sail.."</span></span></p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>Azure</em> wrote:</div><span style="color:orange">"As for the teahouse?  It was a graith tavern before we came.  Starmantle was conquered easily, but there were some pockets of resistance.  This building is in a defensible position, with an ample amount of supply storage, kitches, bed, etc.  You get the picture; it was commandeered by the graith guardsmen for defense.  I was one of the sarth in the assault here, and I admired the building and the fact that was still ... mostly ... intact.  So, with the help of some cohorts we cleaned it back up a bit and made it a teahouse.  The door into the rock there is still stout as ever, and keeps graith thieves out of my herbs whenever I'm away.  I keep the burned front doors as a warning.  I trap 'em if I go anywhere for more than a day.  The windows, too."</span></p>

<p>Xailen seems pretty nonchalant for having admitted to fearing Ii blades.  Fear may be why he decided to sail, but he says so with a shrug and keeps pouring tea.</div><br />
<span style="color:green"><span style="font-weight:bold">"An interesting story regardless, are you able to set <span style="font-style:italic">magical</span> traps or rather more mundane ones?..""</span></span> (she seems genuinely interested in this) </p>

Styrrn thought not.  I, on the other hand, think this will very interesting."</span></p>

<p>Ii'Jyka'vaar turns to see a githyanki shorter than most.  His hair is completely white (almost unheard of among githyanki, and he may dye it so) that frames his head like a lion's mane; no braids, beads, dreads, pins, tails, or anything (also unusual for githyanki).  He looks older than most other githwarriors here, including Xailen and herself, but his mannerisms betray an overabundance of energy.  He only comes up to Ii's chin, and he measures his height against her with a wide grin.<br />
</div><br />
When the smaller Gith suddenly speaks from behind her, she spins round with a murder in her eyes, and she fights the urge to strange the smaller githyanki with her bare hands.. her eyes flare up in silverish light (a by product of the use of psionics), seemingly she blurs from sight.. and speaks through gritted teeth from behind her mask; <span style="color:green"><span style="font-weight:bold">"I advise you not to do that ever again, if you value your life worth of continuing.."</span></span> her fingers seem to cramp a bit whilst she fights the murderous urge, then straightens her fingers and relaxes a bit.. though this seems a bit hard for her to do..</p>

<span style="color:indigo">"Your position IS impressive.  Your rank?  Well, I don't think anybody cares very much around here anymore.  The Black Fleet has a non-traditional command structure, as more befits being pirates, outcasts, thieves, and scallywags.  Styrrn commanded though a combination of ruthlessness, guile, diplomacy, intimidation, and tactics.  You certainly have the intimidation down, and your diplomacy seems pretty good so far.</span></p>

<p>Xailen re-fills this other githyanki's mug, but with a combination of herbs unlike what he gave Ii.</div></p>

<p>Maybe its her gritting or the fact her voice has to come from behind the mask that makes the intimidation not fully come to the fore.. but this seems Ii'Jyka not to bother.. regardless of all this, she did nearly try to strangle the man, whether he knows it or not is somewhat irrelevant.. ~<span style="font-style:italic">"murder swims through her head, songs of blood and murder, so sweet, but her own inner voice pierces through, "happy thoughts, happy thoughts!", and with that the murderous clouding of her mind seems to subsume.."</span>~ then simply stays silent for the duration of this mans reply, only replying with a blank look and subdued voice...; <span style="color:green"><span style="font-weight:bold">"Who are you?.."</span></span>..</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

Intimidate on small Githyanki

<span style="color:indigo">"I'm the Voidwalker.  You are the Knight.  The Sorcerer and the Jade Kith'rak are here as well?  What about the Blades of Git'riban?"</span></p>

<p>With that, he disappears, teleporting away suddenly.</p>

<p>Xailen enlists a githwarrior to help him pour two more trays of tea-mugs.  He also gives another pair a couple of smaller kettles to take outside.  He tells any remaining to also go out and join the meeting in the bar-room.</p>

<p>Soon, he is alone in the tea-cellar with Ii'Jyka'vaar.</p>

<p>*Party*<br />
<div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div><br />
[Sense Motive on the githyanki present. Who's in charge? Who likes/dislikes whom? What's going on here?]<br />
Sense Motive<br />
I rolled 1d20+14, the result is 9, 14 = 23.<br />
</div></p>

<p>Varsh-Mil seems to dominate the group of mostly rank-and-file githwarriors, and his cursing of Styrrn's name echoes among those present.  These are githyanki betrayed by Styrrn, left behind because they were considered unimportant, unwanted, or simply unliked, by Styrrn or one of his closer cronies.</p>

<p>The Duthka'gith are given a wide berth by other githwarriors, though the look of awe is hard to mistake in some.  Among themselves, the female warrior is the more extroverted personality, and speaks eagerly with Kirath and Ar'dru.</p>

<p>There is also a female githyanki sitting alone on a stool near one end of the high bar, observing the gathering.  </p>

<p>Ya'shenn sees another githyanki; short, with white hair like a lion's mane, appear suddenly on the roofless second floor.  It acts as a kind of balcony over the 'bar room'.  </p>

<p>Two more groups of gith soon arrive.  The first group is seven gith sailors led by Gav'jji the Swift.  They are dressed in pirate fashion, with light or minimal armor and swift blades.  Soon behind them are a similar group of nine githwarriors in rich gear lead by Shar'shau.  Lehr'Asj'tor, Ii's contact in the fleet, is also with this second group.</p>

<p>Generally, the greetings and conversation are friendly, but light.  Varsh-Mil helps make introductions.  He speaks mostly with Na'rai of Jade.  Her sarth, Sthar, fetches the rest of her squad; six elite githwarriors with heavy gear.  The Varsh is particularly  complementary to the Jade, and Ya'shenn senses the political undertones.</p>

<p>Mil asks questions about other locales, and shares some tactical information himself.  <span style="color:blue">"The Pirate Isles are our playground.  There is little trade in the West, but swift and bold graith ships increasingly run from Sembia.  Cormyr's Navy guards The Neck, a straight east of here into their own smaller sea.  They have not ventured forth ... yet!  Styrrn, I'm sure, saw no profit in going that way, if they were to try to break out and attack The Dead Stones."</span></p>

<p><span style="color:purple">"I too see little profit in the west.  The Dead Stones are largely looted.  There is nothing there but rebels and refugees.  The Eastern lands on the Sea were hardly touched by the Incursion.  Plenty of trade that way. "</span>  Shar'shau replies.</p>

<p><span style="color:blue">"The west holds little profit, maybe, but how much Honor?  Would you leave your siblings trapped in a profitless passage, if you could save their blades for a better battle?  I may hold the Firebringer in less regard than some others here, but his words, at least, were true in that regard, as were yours Na'rai of Jade.  Let us save as many blades for the ENEMY as we can."</span></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Ya'shenn listens quite attentively to the flow of conversation, paying much attention to whatever she can gather of the personalities of the participants.  Her eyes scan the githyanki present for whatever warband insignia they may still wear, as well as for any other visible clues about them.  (She even attempts to analyze whatever assortment of varied warband insignia Mil might be wearing.)</p>

<p>After Mil speaks, she addresses the pirates of the Black Fleet as a whole, though her attention is focused most on Shar'shau and Gav'jji.  <span style="color:darkblue">"I agree.  As you all have likely heard, our intention is to set sail for the Dead Stones, along with all of you who are willing.  Assisting our brethren in Urmlaspyr would benefit <span style="font-style:italic">everyone</span>, and the preservation of githyanki lives is invariably a detriment to the Great Enemy.  I hardly need mention that assisting them is itself honorable, and that most githyanki in such straits would be highly grateful for such help -- as you yourselves might feel, were you in a similar position.</span>  </p>

<p><span style="color:darkblue">"The moral arguments themselves are strong, and stand on their own, but in case anyone is not fully convinced by these, I will offer a coldly pragmatic argument.  The opinion of others is not <span style="font-style:italic">tangible</span>; it is not something you can hold in your hand like a gold piece; yet it is not less valuable.  That good regard may be less reliable, in some ways, than gold, but it can bring rewards that cannot be bought.  As for the reputation of the Black Fleet...."</span>  she makes an expansive gesture with one hand, but does not elaborate. <span style="color:darkblue">"With the disappearance of its captain, the remaining crew of that fleet now stand to <span style="font-style:italic">alter</span> that reputation, in whichever direction its members may wish. If the Black Fleet were to participate in a deed of might and honor such as this, others would remember it."</span></p>

<p>Inwardly, Ya'shenn feels even more forked-tongued than usual as she says this.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><span style="color:darkblue">"There are other pragmatic considerations, as well.  For example, if some of you were to decide to split from your main force -- which I cannot recommend -- you would lose the advantage of safety in numbers.  While I do not doubt the ferocity of any member of this crew, the <span style="font-style:italic">graith</span> might manage to mount a strong counter-attack at any time, and you would not want to find yourselves isolated from your brethren, a tempting target for hordes of barbarians desperate for revenge.  The smaller your own numbers, and the further away you become from others of our own kind, the more difficult it may become to control even the <span style="font-style:italic">graith</span> who choose to follow you.  Even if you were fortunate enough not to meet organized <span style="font-style:italic">graith</span> opposition, you would only be in a position to attack smaller and less tempting targets, due to your smaller crew.</span></p>

<p><span style="color:darkblue">"There might be <span style="font-style:italic">some</span> sort of loot to be had, even in a picked-over location -- even if it only comes in the form of looted weapons and gear from fallen enemies.  Knowledge is itself a form of treasure, and if any of the barbarians at our destination have information of any use, they can be parted from it easily enough."</span>  Ya'shenn doesn't add that she is a telepath; considering the likely number of pure scum and criminals among this crew, at least <span style="font-style:italic">some</span> of them must be aware of what her dagger means.  <span style="color:darkblue">"If there is a gold piece in Urmlaspyr left to take, I am more likely than most to find out about it."</span>  She looks over to Na'rai of Jade.  <span style="color:darkblue">"However, I believe we are seriously constrained as to space.

         <p>Shar'shau sneers, <span style="color:purple">"Yes, yes. We've heard more than enough pontification about honor and duty from the Varsh already, without the newcomers piling it on too."</span></p>

<p>It is the duthka'gith Khem who replies first to Shar'shau, <span style="color:darkred">"If your desire were to remain here, you should have slunk into the Custom's House and reported to Ib'm.  Those who came here are for sailing, wherever the Black Fleet goes.  It remains only for us now to choose a new command and a direction."</span>  He looks pointedly at Ii, Na'rai, and Kirath.  The newcomers begin to realize that their command of the Black Fleet is far from assured, despite what Lahar and the other commanders said.  <span style="color:darkred"> "I for one am for upholding the other Fleets' recommendations.  We should sail for The Dead Stones with the other fleets and aid in the evacuation.  Of course, if we find anything there worth keeping, then keep it we shall.  We sail under the Jade, the Knight, and the Warlock.  Or at least we keep this appearance for the graith.  It would actually be easier than one of us, who the graith already know, taking command."</span></p>

<p><span style="color:darkblue">"I agree with our cousin,"</span> Gav'jji the Swift speaks up, <span style="color:darkblue">"But in any case the newcomers should join our fellowship officially.  Mlar-Kav'natch bring out the skull."</span></p>

<p>The female githyanki who sat apart silently steps forward.  Out of a sack she pulls an illithid skull guilded with fine crystal and metal lines in complex patterns.  It is recognizable as a control skull from one of the astral ships.</p>

<p><span style="color:darkgreen">"Take the skull and swear to serve the interests of the githyanki of the Black Fleet.  It is a formality, but an important one to us."</span></p>

         <p><span style="color:darkblue">"Beautiful,"</span> Ya'shenn murmurs under her breath, as the captain's skull makes its appearance.  While she takes this situation entirely seriously, the psion is simultaneously <span style="font-style:italic">enjoying</span> the same situation a great deal.  Something about dealing with the variegated scum, misfits, and renegades of the githyanki race appeals to her, while a different aspect of her psyche, undoubtedly influenced by her Tu'narathi upbringing, finds it repulsive.  Then, <span style="color:darkblue">"Styrrn left <span style="font-style:italic">that</span> behind?"</span></p>

<p>Ya'shenn rises to her feet; the ritual nature of the scene is reflected in an increased formality in her own demeanor.  <span style="color:darkblue">"Anyone may rightfully question what the interests of the Black Fleet even <span style="font-style:italic">are</span>, at this point in time.  Look at yourselves, siblings, and cousins.  It is already apparent to me that those of you who sailed under Styrrn are not even in agreement among <span style="font-style:italic">yourselves</span> on this point, yet you would have us swear to that which you yourselves do not know?  The nature of the true interests of the Black Fleet must be made wholly clear before any oath is proper."</span></p>

<p>She looks to the very draconic-looking duthka'gith, Khem.  <span style="color:darkblue">"Honored cousin, your words... they seem to suggest that the Black Fleet may be finding it a bit... difficult to keep its barbarian sailors under control, especially with Styrrn now absent.  Why else volunteer outsiders like ourselves for this purpose?"</span>  Ya'shenn looks to Ii'Jyka'Vaar, then to Kirath and Na'rai.  <span style="color:darkblue">"Should the <span style="font-style:italic">githees</span> Ii'Jyka'Vaar, Na'rai of Jade, and Kirath of the Copper Ring take command of the Black Fleet, it will not be as a polite fiction."</span></p>

<p>She sends to Ii'Jyka'Vaar:  <span style="color:darkblue"><span style="font-style:italic">~Counter proposal:  The identity of the new commanders of the Black Fleet shall be determined here and now, and the oath will be to serve those commanders faithfully for the duration of the voyage... within reason, of course.  I need not mention Pale and unreasonable orders...  You in turn will swear to do right by the crew to the best of your ability.  You may have to duel for the privilege.  Do you want this?</span></span></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

When Ya'shenn sends her the mental communication, Ya'shenn can feel the hatred for this farce seep through, even if its just mental communication.

         <p>It is Av'dra the Dun who replies to Ya'shenn and Ii'Jyka'vaar, <span style="color:red">"The primary interest of us in the Black Fleet is <span style="font-style:italic">survival</span>.  We have all taken this oath, despite or personal and political differences, to watch out for each others' lives.  Our heading of sail matters not.  Our lives matter greatly to us.  Whomever we choose to follow, and it will be our choice; though I still have much respect for the Firebringer he does not command the Black Fleet ... whomever we choose to follow as commanders must swear not to squander our lives neither needlessly nor recklessly."</span></p>

<p>Gav'jji the Swift adds to her words, <span style="color:darkblue">"Indeed.  Each of us will re-affirm our own oaths to the Black Fleet, if necessary, so that all may witness them.  Any who refuse will not sail with us.  As for the Knight, the Jade Kith'rak, and the Warlock; if you have no interest in even symbolically <span style="font-style:italic">joining</span> us, why would we consent to have you <span style="font-style:italic">leading</span> us?"</span></p>

<p>The words are spoken with pride, and Xailen interjects quickly to try to calm things down, <span style="color:orange">"No one is implying that you are anyone's puppet, Githees.  Indeed your rebellion against Master Pale provides more than enough proof that you are not.  But you must understand that each child of Gith here is their own person.  If you are to command, it is by mandate from the fellowship.  I have no doubt you could compel much obedience through violence or the threat thereof, but with all due respect, I think that would be a mistake."</span></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>The Black Fleet gith look unhappy about Ii'Jyka'vaar's request.  Some merely look annoyed while others frown.  Several are about to protest at once, but before they can, Na'rai sweeps in and takes the skull.</p>

<p><span style="color:darkgreen"><span style="font-weight:bold">"That will not be necessary, for me at least."</span></span></p>

<p>She holds the skull aloft wit one hand.  With the other, she removes her jade and silver mask.  All see that her face is heavily scarred, including tentacle scars from at least one unsuccessful attempt by a mind flayer to remove her brain.</p>

<p><span style="color:darkgreen"><span style="font-weight:bold">"I, Kith'rak Narai of The Jade Tower, swear my blades to service in The Black Fleet, to defend the lives of my siblings.  If I am to lead, then to the best of my ability I will strive for victory.  If I am to follow, I will obey any reasonable order.  I will do this until the time comes for me to leave this band of githyanki.  So I swear."</span></span></p>

<p>The Black Fleet githyanki look at each other.  It seems they approve, at least enough to be satisfied.  Na'rai then passes the skull to her Sarth, S'thar, who also makes an oath before passing it, in turn, to each of Na'rai's elite Jade warriors.  The Jade, including S'thar, each specifically include in their oaths a promise to obey Na'rai's orders.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Ya'shenn takes up the skull.  Rather than holding it high in the air, she holds the captain's skull before her in one hand, slightly below her own eye level.  As a gifted historian, she recalls that Gith pirates had drunkenly argued, and githyanki naval crews had more soberly argued, over this point; a captain's skull might be held aloft as trophies were, but others believed that holding an illithid skull above them symbolized illithid superiority, which was of course unthinkable.  </p>

<p>While she speaks in a conversational tone, the psion is addressing the entire audience.  <span style="color:darkblue">"I had hoped that the leadership of the Fleet would be determined with certainty before this point." </span> She isn't happy about taking an oath to an unknown quantity, especially after <span style="font-style:italic">tlai'kajorr</span> Pale.  The pirates of the fleet are likely feeling exactly the same way, though.</p>

<p>The psion's demeanor and tone become more formal and ritualistic once more.  She might surprise everyone by uttering a single sentence in the almost unfathomably ancient tongue of the Forerunners:  <span style="color:darkblue"><span style="font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">"Death to the Enslavers!"</span></span></span><br />
  <br />
Ya'shenn returns to the modern githyanki dialect, primarily to be understandable to her audience, though her refined Tu'narathi accent is even more in evidence than usual.  <span style="color:darkblue">"I, Ya'shenn of the Double-Edged Mind, of the Band of Amber, do take this oath in the presence of my brothers and sisters.  I and the People of the Black Fleet shall be a single crew.  Bearing in mind the purposes of our current mission, I pledge my skills and abilities to defend and preserve their lives as I am able, provided the People of the Black Fleet do the same in my case.  Once the identity of the Black Fleet's leadership has been sincerely agreed upon by its crew, including those of us who are newcomers, I shall obey the reasonable orders of those commanders.  All this I shall do until the time comes for me to leave this band of githyanki."</span>  The psion returns once more to the Forerunner language:  </p>

<p><span style="color:darkblue"><span style="font-weight:bold"><span style="font-style:italic">"This I swear as a child of the Liberator and an ardent despiser of the illithid."</span></span></span></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Emboldened by Ya'shenn and Na'rai, Azthri'zhan'kel adjusts the cloak of her old warband and reaches for the skull once Ya'shenn has finished with it. The Hiver githyanki is impressed by the weight of the skull, different from the humanoid ones in her satchel. Her eyes narrow behind the red lenses of her spectacles and Derog's presence in her mind seems roused by the familiar heft of a ghaik skull. </p>

<p>For a moment the Plague-healer is silent. She peers at the skull and hisses ferally, drawing her sword and holding it with the blade pointed downwards over the skull. Her githyanki is surprisingly good, with only a slight trace of Sigilian accent.</p>

<p>"I, Azthri'zhan'kel, sole survivor of the Band of Carnelian, though born afar from my People, do swear on my sword and honour to use my skills as a healer and warrior to the benefit of all gathered here in the Black Fleet. I pledge my loyalty and service for such time as it is needed by this crew and its officers. May our victories be many, our losses few and may we act as catalysts for the furthered survival of our race. Should I face death, I will not flee from it. Should I be ordered to take my own life, I will not flee from it. So shall my oath be bound and unbroken."</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Athri'zahn'kel snaps out of her trance when the skull is taken from her hands.  She looks into the face of Sark'ja.  The Git'ribani seems genuinely impressed, and looks on the hive-gith with a new respect.  She takes the skull.and holds it ahead of her as it to show it around.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">"This ain't the first crew I've raided with, berks."</span> Her planar cant accent couldn't be more different from Ya'shenn's flawless Tu'narathi and Azthri's surprisingly unaccented githyanki<span style="font-weight:bold"> "I'll join your crew.  To slay or be slain, defend or attack, as fortune dictates, so long as I berth with these brethren.  I, Sark'ja do swear.  Death to The Enemy!"</span></p>

<p>Among the pirates, Gav'jji smiles at the simple words of a gith pirate.  Varsh-Mil shows approval of the more verbose and honorable oaths of the others.  He smiles wider with each one up to Azthri's oath, and he looks at her with approval.  But when Sark'ja speaks, the Varsh sighs and shakes his head.</p>

<p>The other githyanki pirates seem to approve of each one, though.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">
