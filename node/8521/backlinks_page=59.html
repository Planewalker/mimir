         <p>Ya'shenn is mildly surprised by such blatant display of wealth, but feels that she should not be; <span style="font-style:italic">he's a half-dragon, what were you expecting?</span>  Tu'narath had had its share (if not more than its share) of unusually powerful individuals, and some of them enjoyed the possession of such luxuries.  Still, even by those standards, the Firebringer is a bit over the top.  The psion begins to mentally calculate what quantities of metal, food, hardwood, leather, sundry spell components, and other prerequisites of warfare could be purchased just with the treasures in this one room.  Even considering that Lahar himself is more of a psion than a warrior, it seems odd to remove perfectly good ballistae only to replace them with gold and silk.</p>

<p>She also wonders what the future of the People would look like if the Firebringer were to have a major influence on it -- even more influence than he wields already.  She doubts that Lahar could possibly be worse than Pale in that regard, though.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>Azure</em> wrote:</div>"Welcome, children of Gith. Welcome aboard the Fury. To those I have not yet met, I am Firebringer Lahar of Bloodstone. Please, enjoy my hospitality, but I must first handle a matter of command."</div></p>

<p>The psion bows with the same formality she had previously demonstrated upon first meeting Lahar, back in Sigil.  Ya'shenn wants the short warlock to have the opportunity to speak, of course, so she is silent for the moment.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>Azure</em> wrote:</div>Morover, though I see your reasoning in having dropped the illithids' heads over Hlondeth as a warning, you do not fully appreciate just how valuable of objects they are. True, each represents one less ghaik to plague the multiverse, and I cannot argue that this is their principal value, but they are also critical for our efforts to rebuild the fleets...</div></p>

<p>If Ii'Jyka'Vaar is present, Ya'shenn looks toward the knight for a moment, but refrains from mentioning that not <span style="font-style:italic">all</span> of the illithid heads were dropped over Hlondeth.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

True, each represents one less ghaik to plague the multiverse, and I cannot argue that this is their principal value, but they are also critical for our efforts to rebuild the fleets.

If I may be so bold as to enlighten the "choice" of part of this Rakkma to drop the heads of our great enemy over Hlondeth, it was by order of the  Kith'rak Gib, honored as she is, that made Kirath drop his heads over the ghaik city, not by choice of his own.</span></span> Ii'Jyka'Vaar says this in as neutral a tone as to not overstep any bounds that she could, but still help Kirath in saving his face..</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Much has transpired in the past few days alone; Ya'shenn has to think back to the battle over Hlondeth.  </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>Bladedancer</em> wrote:</div>"Although the order was given. The trophy that the Knight has did not come from the raid on Holendeth so I see no reason for punishment."</div></p>

<p>An uncomfortable position for Ya'shenn to be in.  She does not want to contradict a knight so publicly, particularly one who has acted as such a staunch ally.  She does not want Kirath to suffer more of the Firebringer's anger.  She <span style="font-style:italic">definitely</span> does not intend to deceive Lahar.  Even if the fact that he is a half-dragon is... uncomfortable.  <span style="color:darkblue">"Firebringer,</span>" she says in a rather calmer tone of voice than Lahar himself, <span style="color:darkblue">"I was at a control skull myself at the time, after the original pilot expired in battle.  I believe that some confusion <span style="font-style:italic">may</span> exist as to who actually issued that order, and under what circumstances."</span> </p>

<p><span style="color:darkblue">"In any case, I would like to speak on Kirath's behalf myself.  Master Pale did not only intend to forcibly impress the forces that Kirath was leading.  The necromancer sought to capture all of the githyanki forces here at Starmantle -- Captain D'aynn and all the rest -- by surprise.  If it were not specifically for the warlock's involvement, Master Pale might well have succeeded.  The necromancer had taken considerable pains to conceal his destination from us; it was Kirath who was able to obtain that information."</span>  </p>

<p>Ya'shenn seems slightly embarrassed for a moment.  Of course.  As a double-edged, the psion is <span style="font-style:italic">specialized</span> in extracting information from others.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Azthri'Zhan'kel silently observes the four githyanki, carefully scrutinizing their mannerisms to the best of her meagre ability. In particular, she is attempting to pay close attention to the dynamics of the chain of command. A morbid curiosity stirs within her as she steals a glance at the illithid head, idly wondering if she could possibly manage to fit one of their skulls into her satchel alongside those of three of the barbarians who had been responsible for the murder of the Carnelians. Astonishingly, the rogue returns to her original position in the group and bows low, refusing to even lift her head as she dares to address her superiors.</p>

<p>"Firebringer, Githees, Psion Ya'shenn; should we not seek out this Kith'rak Gib as soon as circumstances permit, despite the debated origin of the order? Though I am woefully ignorant of the construction of our kindred's ships, the motives behind such a suspicious act must be questioned, especially in light of the present situation."</p>

         <p>Lahar paces, watching his own bare feet softly pad the floor.  He catches Ii pulling out the illithid head out of the corner of his eye.  It catches his attention, and he does not take his eyes off it, though he speaks to Ya'shenn.  <span style="color:red"><span style="font-weight:bold">"And being in control of an astral skiff, you have noticed an illithid skull is the main component of control.  Few pilots not involved in the flying ships' construction and maintenance bother reflecting on the critical importance of this single part ... a part difficult to obtain under the best circumstances.  In addition, it must be completely intact.  I have seen too many ruined by not just by the circumstances of combat but also by careless or over-exuberant removal after the fact.</span></span></p>

<p>Lahar chuckles to himself, over some private joke, perhaps.  His amusement almost bursts into mirth, but he sees the other githyankis' eyes on him. <span style="color:red"><span style="font-weight:bold">"*ahem* ... So valuable are ghaik skulls that I have issued edicts to the graith concerning them.  Any individual who presents three severed illithid heads will be counted not-foe, and spared githyanki blades.  Any guild, adventuring band, caravan, ship, or other such moderate organization that presents nine illithid heads via emissary shall be counted not-foe.  A city, graith king, or nation that presents eighty-one illithid heads via three emissaries will be not-foe."</span></span>  He pauses to see if anyone gets the joke before continuing, <span style="color:red"><span style="font-weight:bold">"So, if the Yuan-ti of Hlondeth are smart about it, they may yet earn a reprieve from further githyanki retaliation by sending us many of the same heads your forces took that day.  Heads with shattered skulls, now useless to our engineers."</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color:red"><span style="font-weight:bold">"The fact remains that whoever the idea really came from, Gib knew the skulls' value to me and said nothing.  I believe it was done .. or rather not done ... intentionally to anger me, and make me punish Kirath.  It also has the side effect of making us somewhat more dependent on her dragon allies ... and duthka'gith with wings ... "</span></span>  Lahar gives Ar'dru a smirk and a nod.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Kirath takes the strip of command in stride knowing one such as him did not really deserve or even want it. He knew Geb was using him but didn't really care as it was a means to an end. Anything to get out of the underdark and to put the hurt on some  ghaik collaborators. Politics was never his forte and with no command he didn't need to be a slave to it anymore.</p>

<p>During the conversation in which he surprisingly defended at every turn by members of his impromptu warband  even by the unsettling Knight Ii'jyka'vaar and the young Azthri'Zhan'kel.  A warm feeling that he hasn't felt since before the doom of the Copper Ring fills his cold heart camaraderie. </p>

<p>After the conversation dies down Kirath turns and bows to Lahar saying </p>

<p>"Greetings Fire Binger Lahar  I take full responsibility for the orders given and borrowing your ships. We did not have the time to seek permission to take the ships as the information we received that the yuan-ti of Hlondeth was harboring illithids was time sensitive. Now with all due respect (he winces slightly when he says this)  if you could put your anger aside for now we should figure out what are we to do about Master Pale. If it were up to him every son and daughter of Gith would serve his agenda as the walking dead under his command. "</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Ya'shenn samples the liquor, but to such a cautious extent that she can reasonably expect to be mocked over it.  The psion does not anticipate that Lahar would try to drug or poison them, and her psionic disciplines (should she choose to use them) would be as effective on alcohol as on any other toxin.  Perhaps she simply likes being in control of her mental faculties...</p>

<p><span style="color:darkblue">"Ah, I am remiss..."</span> The psion provides proper introductions for those with whom Lahar is not yet acquainted... unless, of course, anyone in their group seems particularly reluctant to be properly introduced.  </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>Azure</em> wrote:</div>He wipes a flaming drop from his lips and inquires as to what plane-hopping adventures brought the Sigilan githyanki to this world. He listens to all with rapt attention, especially tales of killing ghaik.</div></p>

<p>Ya'shenn realizes that she ought to show an appropriately zealous enthusiasm when the subject of <span style="font-style:italic">rrakkma</span> comes up, but is, at this moment, much too cynical (and under stress, thanks to dealing with Pale) to really <span style="font-style:italic">feel</span> a great enthusiasm for it.  Of course, the fact that she has not a single tentacled trophy to her own credit from said <span style="font-style:italic">rrakkma</span> may play a part.  It would be pleasant to share Az'thri'zhan'kel's raw illithid-hating vigor right now.</p>

<p><span style="color:darkblue">"In truth, while neither group was expecting the other, Kirath's arrival in Hlondeth was very timely for us."</span>  While she describes how their group became marooned by a skipping portal, the psion does <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> mention that by now she thinks they were probably tricked into using that particular portal.  It simply seems far too convenient to be otherwise.  She is happy to emphasize the battle-ferocity of Kirath, Ii'Jyka'Vaar, and Ar'dru in particular.  </p>

<p>It occurs to the psion, not for the first time, that Lahar remains a stranger to her to a great extent.  To what extent do the Firebringer's wishes and goals truly agree with their own?  With <span style="font-style:italic">her</span> own?  </p>

<p>Still, she <span style="font-style:italic">had</span> offered to brief him on the situation.  </p>

<p><span style="color:darkblue">"Firebringer, I have certain questions of my own... and my siblings may as well.  The two psions now aboard Pale's vessels... your own?"</span>  <span style="font-style:italic">Why both githyanki then, if his crew are almost all half-dragons?</span>  <span style="color:darkblue">"If they happen to be what brought you to Starmantle...I would like to inquire what brought them to the city."</span>  While interested in this subject, Ya'shenn is even more interested in what Lahar's relationship to the necromancer had been up to this point.</p>

<p>[Sense Motive, to try to get a sense of what Lahar is really thinking/feeling, and also to get a sense of how subtle/transparent he is.  (Leaning strongly toward 'subtle' at the moment.)  Ya'shenn would like to try to figure out his current opinion of:  the party in general; Ya'shenn and Kirath in particular; Pale, and Mist.  Due to his high level, she may not be able to guess much, but we'll try.]</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>[Sense Motive: Lahar is genuine, in his emotions at least.  When he says he is angry,  Ya'shenn can sense it empathicly.  When he is welcoming, she can feel his anger dim into a pale ember.  Being genuine is not the same as being honest, however.  Lahar is indeed probing the party for information, though he is being polite about it.  He likely has his own interests in Sigil., was well as here (and possibly on multiple Incursion worlds, if he's interested in Sigil).  From his demeanor, though, he has little deception about him, and he is likely to answer questions honestly.  As for what he thinks of the party, he is genuinely welcoming.  They are honored ghaik-slayers, and he treats them as such.  Pale and Mist garner a careful respect as rival commanders.  He seems to think that Pale's presence is a complication, but will talk before fighting.]</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>A true Hiver, Azthri'Zhan'kel pours herself a generous portion of one of the beverages. The doctor's nervousness is palpable and all present will note that she seems to be drinking more to steady her nerves than truly savour the vintage. After her third round she reaches into her satchel, placing four graith skulls and two large leather-bound books onto the table in front of her.  The skulls themselves are adorned in tir'su carved deep into the surface. Azthri'Zhan'kel gestures for anyone interested to take a closer look and grins wickedly.  Those who do will note very detailed descriptions that are transcribed with the clinical detachment expected of a mortician.…..as well as a short, though revealing series of tir’su carved on the foreheads of each gleaming specimen: <span style="font-style:italic">Executed by Azthri’Zhan’kel, last of the Carnelian warband.  Justice reigns.</span></p>

<p>She straightens her posture and blinks, recalling to mind what she knows of Sembia, though her presently inebriated state makes the task somewhat difficult. The Incursion had hit the graith kingdom hard, though it managed to survive the barrage of attacks remarkably well. An acute feeling of shame for drinking so heavily in the presence of others of the People works its way into her brain and she folds her arms across her chest.</p>

<p>“Consider these a small tribute, Firebringer. I wish they were illithid skulls, now that I know of your dire need for them.  The spellbook from the graith wizard and the journal of the leader of the murderers might be of use….I could not translate their language. Speaking of <span style="font-style:italic">rrakkma</span>, I am......embarassed to admit I have never undergone a first <span style="font-style:italic">rrakkma</span>. The circumstances surrounding my early years were not.....conductive.....to the cultivation of a proper githyanki, despite my acceptance into a warband during the Incursion. Even those among us who are Git'ribani are far better than I, so I ask for your pardon if what I say or do is out of line, so to speak. ”<br />

         <p>Sick of politics and manipulation Ar'Dru takes Lahar at face value and is delighted at the turn of events. He drinks what would be a ridiculous amount for any with a lesser constitution favouring potent short drinks rather than long, quaffing ones. </p>

<p>He listens appreciatively to Lahar's tales and adds a few of his own, sharing the credit where appropriate but not hesitating to tell of his own skill, producing skulls of notable foes to emphasise his tales where appropriate, occasionally standing to demonstrate th fencing techniques he used to best his foes.</p>

<p>Noting the restraint on the part of Ya'shenn and Ii'Jyka'Vaar Ar'Dru turns to them in a friendly, though somewhat stern manner.<br />
"Sisters, the liquor is plentiful and our host honorable. Drink deeply lest you cause him to think that you have no steel in you."</p>

<p>He nods approvingly at Azthri both as she drinks and when she produces the skulls. "You truly have Gith's blood in you little sister!" he exclaims. "A shame your were not raised with the people but no matter, you are now and you'll soon have a Ghaik for your head-bag."</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Azthri'Zhan'kel practically glows at Ar'dru's encouraging compliments and eagerly makes mental notes of the impressive fencing maneuvers the winged duthka'gith displays. The skulls mentioned by Ii'Jyka'Vaar and those Ar'dru presents as he relates his own deeds elicit a sense of strong admiration and kinship as well, knowing her treatment of her foes was not unusual. It is not long before the doctor starts a fourth round, pushing her set of skulls further forward. </p>

<p>"You may keep one if you wish, honoured brother!" she smiles. "I am hardly worthy of your praise, though I shall accept it nonetheless." </p>

<p>After she finishes the last drink, raised to Ar'dru in respect, Azthri'Zhan'kel eyes the empty glass, somewhat amazed at her own daring.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

We have managed to hold two cities in southern Sembia, and the countryside around, but the graith are gathering their forces as we speak.

In fact, my ships are mostly empty.  I have little more than enough gith to pilot them, for I had planned on evacuating as many as I can.  I do have a few surprises for the graith armies as well, but protracted battle is not what I would council.  I will try to convince the fleet commanders to leave Starmantle with skeleton crews in order to ferry as many gith from Urmlaspyr as possible."</span></span></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>While she might ordinarily be considered a 'difficult to goad' personality, apparently being admonished by a duthka'gith, in front of another duthka'gith of high status, is actually sufficient to goad the psion.  Ya'shenn drinks more of the (really quite excellent) liquor than she had intended.  Of course, she's much too paranoid an individual to knowingly get drunk, so this change likely means that she's drinking 'with restraint' rather than 'ridiculously little.'</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>Azure</em> wrote:</div>"My true business is in the Dead Stones; Urmlaspyr in southern Sembia. Our forces there are soon to be besieged from two sides, and the commanders must decide what is to be done. I wonder at Pale's presence, for he had a good thing going in the border regions of two graith empires in the south. That he sees the need in Sembia and brings his forces is encouraging, after a fashion, but I wonder if our ideas about our course of action are the same?</div></p>

<p><span style="color:darkblue">"Pale has made a similar claim:  that Urmlaspyr is his own destination as well.  If that is the case, I find that I must wonder why he felt it so necessary to attempt to take Starmantle by surprise, and to attempt to use conscripted forces to do so."</span>  Both heavy sarcasm and bitterness are evident in the psion's voice.  <span style="color:darkblue">"I could also wish that the necromancer had actually revealed Urmlaspyr as his destination before his hand was forced.  I have at least some reason to believe that his ultimate destination is... beyond Urmlaspyr... but his desire to visit the Dead Stones does appear to be sincere."</span></p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>Azure</em> wrote:</div>In fact, my ships are mostly empty. I have little more than enough gith to pilot them, for I had planned on evacuating as many as I can. I do have a few surprises for the graith armies as well, but protracted battle is not what I would council. I will try to convince the fleet commanders to leave Starmantle with skeleton crews in order to ferry as many gith from Urmlaspyr as possible."</div></p>

<p><span style="color:darkblue">"Firebringer, this certainly would seem to leave us with a conundrum."</span>  The psion speaks with heavy irony.  <span style="color:darkblue">"Pale appears to be gathering forces for a major attack.  Including forces which are not eager to be so gathered.  He also seeks ships:  in fact, he was quite eager to poach those of Starmantle's githyanki captains.  I cannot object to his apparent goal of fighting <span style="font-style:italic">graith</span> at Urmlaspyr.  Still, if his goal is such a desirable one, one must wonder why he is so willing to ambush and conscript his own People in pursuit of it."</span></p>

<p>In the ancient, cultured cities of the Astral -- at least in Ya'shenn's experience -- it would be rare to present such a trophy with such fanfare, for the simple reason that barbarians are seldom considered worthy foes.  <span style="font-style:italic">Of course, barbarians that are capable of extinguishing an entire warband would surely be considered a 'worthy foe,' no?  Destroying the destroyers of one's own warband is no easy task, either!</span>  </p>

<p><span style="color:darkblue">"It is very good that you extinguished the destroyers of the Carnelian, sister."</span>  With mild curiosity:  <span style="color:darkblue">"Sister, might I examine the journal and spellbook for a moment?  I cannot guarantee that I can read the language myself... particularly if it is one of the innumerable languages of human <span style="font-style:italic">graith...</span> but an understanding of linguistics is almost a prerequisite for a telepath."</span></p>

<p>[Ya'shenn doesn't have <span style="font-style:italic">read magic</span>, but if the spellbook contains any regular text such as an introduction, in Draconic perhaps, she might understand it.]</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>"I would be rude to refuse! What is mine is my warband's, with the exception of my surgeon's tools and a few small trinkets." Azthri'Zhan'kel nods at Kirath. She pours a glass of razorvine brandy mixed with a blend of pleasent herbs and makes a note to enquire about the recipe. After a few iips the doctor rests against the back of the chair, eyes half-closed in a pensive expression, seeming older for a brief moment. Derog smoothly extracts control from her in that moment.</p>

<p>"Firebringer, would it be safe to assume that this.....Master Pale could be planning to engage your forces even as we speak? Wouldn't it be to your advantage to land the first strike? Don't have superior numbers?" Derog leans forward, steepling his fingers. "Forgive me for my impaitence. I'd rather avoid a massacre if possible. Better to cripple him now."</p>

<p>Derog fixes a calculating look around the room before letting Azthri'zhan'kel resume control. </p>

         <p>Ii'Jyka'Vaar simply raises a eyebrow to the sudden serious remark by the newcomer, but does not raise objections to her comment.<br />
Also noting the multiple interest in the 2 books of arcane knowledge, she lowers her hand and finishes what is left of her drink, then says;<br />
<span style="color:green">"If you would all excuse me, I have some pressing private actions to perform.."</span>, with that said, she slinks off to her quarters, goes into her room and locks the door.</p>

<p>She then places the Nagamaki on her lap after sitting down cross-legged. she begins to trance and after several minutes, she is in a semi delusional state, the air around her seems to waver, as if from great heat, almost like a mirage..<br />
The whispers in her head become stronger and more defined, loud enough to make her head sway, she bobs and weaves her head in her snakelike fashion, the ripples in the air now almost touchable and humming ever so slightly with the power of her ritual.<br />
<span style="font-style:italic"><span style="color:orange">"Asssk..."</span></span> the voice commands..<br />

What is mine is my warband's, with the exception of my surgeon's tools and a few small trinkets." Azthri'Zhan'kel nods at Kirath. She pours a glass of razorvine brandy mixed with a blend of pleasent herbs and makes a note to enquire about the recipe. After a few iips the doctor rests against the back of the chair, eyes half-closed in a pensive expression, seeming older for a brief moment. Derog smoothly extracts control from her in that moment.</p>

<p>"Firebringer, would it be safe to assume that this.....Master Pale could be planning to engage your forces even as we speak? Wouldn't it be to your advantage to land the first strike? Don't have superior numbers?" Derog leans forward, steepling his fingers. "Forgive me for my impaitence. I'd rather avoid a massacre if possible. Better to cripple him now."</p>

<p>Derog fixes a calculating look around the room before letting Azthri'zhan'kel resume control. </p>

<p>(Sense Motive: Did anyone catch the shift in her personality )</div></p>

<p>Lahar, who had been merely sipping his drink, quickly downs it.  He holds the glass in his hand and a radiant heat is felt, like a stove.  The glass starts to soften. <span style="color:red"><span style="font-weight:bold">"If Pale wants to attack me, he will burn.

But no, I have use for Pale.  It is Mist that worries me.  Pale is an instrument, a powerful one it is true, but nonetheless he is no tactical commander.  He has no strategy beyond increasing his own personal power, be it in the form of arcane might or authority.  Mist is a different creature altogether.  She has a plan, hatched in darkness with a hundred shadows working it forward, of this I am sure."</span></span></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Azthri'Zhan'kel mulls over her choice of phrase carefully, as it is clear from Lahar's reaction that Derog's "subtle attempt" to encourage decisive action has set the gears in his mind whirling. She decides against speaking for the present time to discourage her chances of uttering a fatal reply. It is a great relief when Ar'Dru takes the initiative. The Hiver idly considers permitting Derog to fully manifest when around a safer environment to exploit his use as an incorporeal undead, then reminds herself that the chances of any member of the warband permitting her to live after such a revelation are obscenely low. However, a plan begins to take shape at Lahar’s mention of tools. She recalls observing a strategic board game played by her mentor and three opponents, whom her mentor had defeated easily by unexpectedly moving a series of pawn pieces.<br />
 <br />
“<span style="font-style:italic">Even the lowliest among us can achieve a victory.</span>” The older githyanki had stated when Azthri’Zhan’kel questioned her technique. “<span style="font-style:italic">Yet that victory is not always an assurance they will survive to achieve another.</span>” </p>

<p>The doctor wonders if perhaps she should offer to become one of those pawns, though Derog vehemently protests.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>Azure</em> wrote:</div>"Mist is a different creature altogether. She has a plan, hatched in darkness with a hundred shadows working it forward, of this I am sure."</div></p>

<p>Ya'shenn is uncharacteristically silent for a while, gazing into her wineglass.  As the Firebringer finishes his drink, the psion ceases drinking entirely.  She is frankly intimidated by the forceful... it would be tempting to call it 'fiery...' personality of this commander of the Band of Bloodstone, though as a matter of course she tries to keep this fact far from her expression.  The psion also highly doubts that she could be the only githyanki to ever feel similarly.  She gives the Firebringer plenty of time to respond to Ar'dru's question, should he wish to do so.</p>

<p>Lahar cannot possibly have missed the provenance of the long, slender dagger she wears.  Liberator only knows what he thinks of that aspect of the situation.  The psion also wonders for a moment whether she, Ya'shenn, herself, might not be one of those hundred shadows, however much she might wish otherwise.  There had been one piece of information in K'tch's mind that she had not shared with the others.  The fact that anything she had found in K'tch's mind might be either truth or complete disinformation does not help.</p>

<p><span style="color:darkblue">"I am not certain that even she anticipated this turn of events.  Certainly I did not."</span>  <span style="font-style:italic">If she did, she is much more fearsome even than her reputation.</span>  <span style="color:darkblue">"I can share with you what I do know of her, and much that I have heard, but what I do not have is the knowledge of her grand plan."</span>  <span style="font-style:italic">Or do I?  Curse it, was it not Mist-of-the-Mind, and not Pale, who uttered that detestable order?  You would trust anything from her, under the circumstances?</span></p>

<p>To Lahar, silently:  <span style="color:darkblue"><span style="font-style:italic">~Ask your questions, Firebringer; I will answer as I am able.</span></span></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

He takes from her mind mostly tactical information; composition of forces, Pale's state of mind, mannerism changes when Mist takes control, statements and conversations which may give clues as to their plans, and the like.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Soon, other githyanki arrive at Lahar's ship, Commanders Ra-Shiis and Zjaa.  Both seem extremely familiar with Lahar.  Indeed, it is soon revealed that they were sub-commanders of his during the Incursion.  Evidently, only his core elite troops were duthka'gith.  Most of his troops were githyanki of the bands of Bloodstone, Ruby, and Garnet.</p>

<p>Lahar then begins to talk about the current political situation, and the commanders follow his lead.  Soon the party is brought up to speed on the situation as it exists on Toril.  </p>

<p>{DM some of this is recap, some new}</p>

<p>The githyanki troops have split into camps.  Commands have been reassigned and decentralized.  Each Commander (often also called Captain, especially in the fleets) has her own loyalty, and attracts like-minded warriors (and, likely, spies).  The largest power blocs are the Apocalytes, The Ascendancy, and The Cult of Tiamat.  The Heartforce and the Silver Eyes have some elite units (like the Jade the party has already met), but both prefer to try to influence the Apocalytes instead of risk their own resources.</p>

<p>The Ascendancy is centered in southern Sembia and, at least until Pale moved his forces, the borderlands between Amn and Tethyr.  All the Knights abandoned their units and banded together in Sembia under The Claws of Death, a red dragon dracolich.  It is a member of the Court of Vlaakith from the neg-energy plane, one of the only non-githyanki to be so honored.  The Claws of Death thus unites the three camps of the Ascendancy, as well as The Cult of Tiamat under its banner.  The dracolich rules southern Sembia from the city of Daerlun, but its borders are threatened.  To the west, the armies of Cormyr are preparing for a MAJOR campaign against the githyanki.  So far they have driven the githwarriors from their own territory and secured their borders (though dragons still stalk the mountain passes).  A lesser threat lies to the north and east, for though the armies of Sembia were crushed, the territory of northern Sembia was never occupied by the gith.  The cities of Sembia have received help from outside, and successful insurgencies have reclaimed the cities of Selgaunt and Saerloon for the graith.  They haven't the strength to mount a major offensive, not yet, but they get stronger every day.</p>

<p><span style="color:red"><span style="font-weight:bold">"Besides, our intel may be wrong.  Supposedly, the graith are disorganized due to their typical barbarian bickering.  Deserters from the allied companies, once loyal to Vlaakith's overlord, have dispersed north and banditry is epidemic.  Not all the 'aid' from other graith was helpful, either.  Foes of the Sembian graith have sent many agents, and then there are of course the slaves of Powers, always working their own patrons' wills to the detriment of other graith temples.  Even so, I would be a fool to ignore the treat from northern Sembia and the Dales.  We githyanki only really hold the cities of Daerlun and Urmlaspyr, and some buffer territory.  Most of 'our' territory in Sembia is actually burned-out villages without a single githwarrior to garrison them.  Graith scouts scurry like rats through these ruins, and the they may be far better informed about us than we are of them."</span></span></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>Zimrazim</em> wrote:</div><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>Azure</em> wrote:</div>"Then there is Westgate, a pirate city but day's sail from the Dead Stones of Urmlaspyr. I know of six portals, but none are easy to use."</p>

<p>"I must admit, the idea of sending you behind the barbarians' backs to cause chaos on your way back to Sigil intrigues me. I am loath to part with the ships to transport you, however."</div></p>

<p><span style="color:darkblue">"Westgate,"</span> Ya'shenn muses.  <span style="color:darkblue">"In what manner are these portals difficult to use?  Difficult portal keys, or hordes of easily angered <span style="font-style:italic">graith</span>?  Or both?"</span>  <br />
</div></p>

<p><span style="color:red"><span style="font-weight:bold">"Yes, yes, and yes, depending on the portal.  Of the two easiest in my opinion, one manifests under a bridge spanning the river which runs through the city.  It manifests under a similar bridge at one end of Hull Street in the Clerks Ward.  The key is a boat without a bottom.  A difficult vessel to sail, assuredly.  Then there is the light tower in Westgate.  Another portal manifests in one of the upper windows at dawn.  Its key is a wax-dipped feather.  The Sigil end is unpredictable, however, and could as easily dump you in any number of bad spots.  The other known portals are mostly in or near the open market in the center of Westgate.  The <span style="font-style:italic">graiths'</span> main tower and jail is in the center of the market too, and in fact one of the manifestation points is in one of the middens.  I will warn you, the barbarians are wise to us now, and anti-teleportation magics permeate their dungeon."</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color:red"><span style="font-weight:bold">"Westgate is dangerous, but the regime that rules it is not hostile to us.  Many are former pirate lords who we used to help conquer the Dragon Reach. </span></span></p>

<p>Lahar smiles and takes another drink. </p>

<p>Lahar begins the tale, but Captains Zjaa and Ra-Shiis often chime in, for they were part of Lahar's personal strike team during the Incursion.  One of the tasks given to the Firebringer was to scour the pirate isles of the Sea of fallen Stars.  A difficult task considering the number of islets and hidden villages.  Lahar identified among the pirates of the isles, one powerful port whose <span style="font-style:italic">graith</span> were ruled by a small(ish) but magically adept green dragon.  Lahar put his forces on recon, and went with a small party to the pirate's port.</p>

<p>Ra-Shiis proves the most jolly tale-teller, laughing at some of the episodes;  Lahar finding a portal in the inn's "haunted" bathtub, Lahar deciding to burn the slave market, Lahar attacking the jail in the orcs' quarter after one of their number was captured (then deciding to declare war on the local orcs for their affront), Lahar smashing in the door of the humans' leader and beating up her guards ... with his mind.</p>

<p><span style="color:red"><span style="font-weight:bold">"Yes, well, my PLAN was actually to offer her 'emissary terms'.  She accepted and lived.  I ordered her to go, with one of my skiffs and a trio of githwarriors, to fly to the uttermost east of the sea, and deliver the message</span> A ship on a westerly course will not be harmed by the githyanki.  All others, and all villages found inhabited, will burn. <span style="font-weight:bold"> I then relayed the same order to my forces and ordered them fly to the east as well, before sweeping through the isles.  By the time they arrived at where we were, I had slain the dragon and conquered the town.  The surviving leaders then formed the core of a growing armada of pirates heading for Starmantle, Westgate, and other ports on the western end of the sea.  We conquered Westgate and the Dragon Reach without committing substantial githyanki forces, for the worst scum the barbarians can boast of did it for us!</span></span></p> <div class="dice_rolls">
