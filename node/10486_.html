          Primordials in Planescape        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
        <div class="dice_rolls">
</div> <p>To a certain degree there already are Primordials in Planescape canon, and it's not a 4e thing.  While 4e has grouped all of the elemental princes (like Imix) and powers (Akadi, Grumbar, Kossuth and Istishia) into Primordials, the concept of Primordials is something that's quite common in Myths.  Obviously Greek Mythology being the most apparent source of such beings with the Titans whom the Gods overthrew, and who certainly do exist in Planescape canon.  And Norse Mythology has the Jotun, who are in some ways also Primordials.  There's Pan Gu and Nüwa from Chinese Mythology, the Asuras of Hindu mythology can sort of be seen as such beings.  And Tiamat as described in Babylonian mythology (and not D&amp;D where she's totally different) was also such a being.</p>

<p>Though 4e's concept of Primordials, seems to me to be one they ripped off from White Wolf's Exalted, which I never even played or know much about.  But the backstory from Exalted seems to be where they tried to invoke something from the concepts of such ancient beings and actually succeeded in having a compelling myth origin.  4e certainly falls flat of what White Wolf did with Exalted.</p>

<p>However the way Primordials are generally presented is in a much too simplistic way, usually with Primordial=Bad.  While most of the Greek Titans were seen as bad even if they it was only because Chronus opposed Zeus, Gaia (who sided with the Gods in Exalted backstory, 4e has no such equivalent) and Rhea are usually seen as the more benevolent Primordial powers.  Nüwa the Chinese serpent Goddess could probably be in the same category as Gaia and Rhea, being sort of the Earth Mother types.  While it's certain that many myths go on about forces of chaos which the Primordials represent who carelessly destroy and recreate.  But there are some like Pan Gu and Ymir weren't quite forces of destruction, but rather ones who's death created a lot of the worlds.</p>

<p>Going into Paizo's latter articles of Dragon, they even went far enough to suggest that Queen Morwel and by extension the Eladrin Court of Stars were in fact Primordials.  And I know there's plenty of references around Planescape and other D&amp;D canon about obscure ancient powerful entities.</p>

<p>So putting aside the specifics of all these myths, what do you think the role and real dark of the Primordial Powers are?</p>

<p>While I think some of them are certainly forces of nature, many of them are just like any other Power out there, except they've been around longer.</p>

<p>But I'm interested in what some other thoughts are, and what might there be that could be a Primordial Power.</p>       </div>

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>A lot of the obyrith backstory from Fiendish Codex I ended up as primordial backstory in 4e, with primodials becoming the oldest demon lords. Even more so, the demons vs. Gods backstory in Fiendish Codex II pretty clearly evolved directly into the 4e primordial story. Apart from that, the distinguishing quality of a primordial is its elemental nature - the gods are Astral beings, and primordials are their elemental counterparts. Ymir, born from ice and mist, would certainly be a primordial, but recasting the Greek titans, other than Gaia and Rhea, perhaps, would force some changes. Not all 4e primordials are evil, though most opposed the gods. Many of the gods are evil, of course. I tend to assume the four elemental rulers must have either sided with the gods or made some kind of truce.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>I'm not completely satisfied about the Primordial backstory, and in Exalted what seems to be the other big inspiration of 4e's Primordial backstory, it has Gaia and Autochthon siding with the Gods.  The other Primordials in that became things like Neverborn and Yozis, similar to how I guess some Primordials became possibly Obyriths (who will be brought back in the Demonomicon) and Demon Lords, and others may have Primal Spirits or Archfey.  For all intents and purposes both Primordials and Gods would be Powers, it's just that they are respectively Primordial Powers and Astral Powers.  I think another difference is that Primordial Powers just aren't dependant on belief the way Astral Powers are.</p>

<p>And while Gaia is mostly benevolent, I read that their was one time in some Greek myth where she unleashed the Gigantes against the Olympians because she was dissatisfied at the way they treated her children the Titans.</p>

<p>Though I'd say that there probably were a bunch of Primordials who never fought in 4e's Dawn War, and generally reached a truce later through their non-involvement.  These would probably be ones like Gaia, Rhea, N&uuml;wa, Akadi, Grumbar, Kossuth, Istishia, the Princes of Elemental Good, and a few more.  While some of the others became something else.  In FR's retconned backstory, it was Ao himself that brought some sort of truce and gave Toril to the Gods and Aebir to the Primordials.  </p>

<p>Of course 4e's Dawn War, seems to be something that Tharizdun caused when he cast his Seed of Evil into reality.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>My impression is that the primordials objected to the gods attempting to bring stability to the world they were endlessly reshaping - that it was a philosophical difference that would have required some kind of war to hammer out regardless of what Tharizdun was doing.</p>

<p>Most of the gods vs. primordial war seems to have been between gods and primordials, with demons (primordials corrupted by the evil seed) only showing up afterward. I do notice that 4e has Dagon as substantially older than corrupted primordials like Demogorgon and Orcus, so perhaps obyriths are a completely different class of being, not connected to primordials.</p>

<p>I really like the gods vs. primordials story when it comes to D&amp;D mythmaking - not myths inspired by real world deities, but in filling out the Greyhawk pantheon and so forth. I wouldn't consider it to be the "real" version of events with regard to Planescape, since it happens much too early for the gods as such to be around at all. The Wind Dukes of Aaqa battling the obyriths is what "really" happened, with the myths came later. But still, there seems to have been some kind of primal struggle in the Inner Planes before they settled in their modern structure, and Law and Chaos were in contention before the Wind Dukes were even born.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I don't like the idea of bringing 4E fluff into 3.5 and earlier versions, especially into the Planescape setting.  <br />
This is especially since the Primordial fluff doesn't match that of 3x... or 1e/2e for that matter.<br />
4E is suggesting that the primordials are from the Previous Age/Previous Multiverse/Antediluvian era much like the aboleths, which simply wasn't the case in 3x.  <br />
In 3x and 2E, elementals sprang at the very beginning of the current Multiverse along with the elemental planes.</p>

<p>4E expects us to believe that they are as old as the elder evils, which simply is not true, because the antediluvian elder evils come from a previous Multiverse that possesssed very different physics (and of course, I threw out the idea that some elemental and genie sages claim that the tears in reality that lead to the Far Realm are, in fact, time portals leading to the previous multiverse.  I was surprised and delighted to find this theory mentioned in Lords of Madness as well), and the Elder Evils are every bit as inimical to elementals as they are to everything else (except probably obyriths)</p>

<p>In 3x/Planescape the only creatures that would fit the Primordial fluff are the Titans, Obyriths, Baatorians, Tharizdun, Ghaunadaur, The Patient One, and the deities of antediluvian aberrations such as the aboleth.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>BTW, Ripvanwormer, I am developing something similar to the Primordial vs. Gods thing in regards to the Previous Age/Multiverse.  Basically, there is a prevalent belief/theory that the first gods went to war with the Elder Evils and won.  This occurred at the very beginning of the current Multiverse, not long after the elemental planes were spawned by the Ethereal.  The Elder Evils were, of course, significantly weakened and fewer in number already due to the destruction of the previous multiverse.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>It depends on your definition of "gods," really. The powers appear rather late in the Hellbound timeline, though it's suggested they may have been secretly around for considerably longer. Most 2nd and 3rd edition sources have the gods created by mortal belief, so one wouldn't expect to see them until after mortals came around. <span style="font-style:italic">Lords of Madness</span> suggests the faith of the aboleth servitor races created the first gods, who helped overthrow the aboleth empire. <span style="font-style:italic">Elder Evils</span> says that before the time of the gods was the time of primal forces, beings of godlike power but not dependent on mortal belief. That's generally my opinion on the subject. I think if there was a conflict at the very beginning of the current Multiverse, gods as they are commonly known today were not involved. I'd expect a war with the Elder Evils to be between beings from Outside and native entities formed from the primal forces of creation, resisting the incursion. These native forces may have been the ancestors of what is now known as the forces of Law, Chaos, Good, Evil, and Balance, or the ancestors of the eldest elementals, or both. </p>

<p>I think the 4th edition primordials lore is very good for myth-making, but I'd rather "reality" - the "actual" history before the myths took shape - was more complex.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>Hyena of Ice</em> wrote:</div>I don't like the idea of bringing 4E fluff into 3.5 and earlier versions, especially into the Planescape setting.  
</div>
This is both about bringing 4e fluff to earlier editions, and bringing PS fluff to 4e, and anywhere in between.
<div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>
This is especially since the Primordial fluff doesn't match that of 3x... or 1e/2e for that matter.
4E is suggesting that the primordials are from the Previous Age/Previous Multiverse/Antediluvian era much like the aboleths, which simply wasn't the case in 3x.  
In 3x and 2E, elementals sprang at the very beginning of the current Multiverse along with the elemental planes.
</div>
Beyond the comparisons to Exalted, I see that they sort of tried to use common elements in the many mythologies around the world, of the idea of the ones before the Gods.  They're more of something from the Previous Age as opposed to the Previous Multiverse, as there's certainly a difference between the Far Realms influence and Primordial influence.  I find it somewhat ironic that when the Titans ruled in Greek Mythology, it was called the Golden Age.</p>

<p>I think that in a PS setting that used the lore of the Primordials in it, there would certainly be philosophies sympathetic to the Primordials, as it wouldn't be of the simplistic "Primordials are unchecked forces of destruction" that 4e canon and many of their designers make them out to be.  I'm certain some would see there has been a great imbalance caused by death and imprisonment of many of the Primordials.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>""It depends on your definition of "gods," really. The powers appear rather late in the Hellbound timeline, though it's suggested they may have been secretly around for considerably longer. Most 2nd and 3rd edition sources have the gods created by mortal belief, so one wouldn't expect to see them until after mortals came around. Lords of Madness suggests the faith of the aboleth servitor races created the first gods, who helped overthrow the aboleth empire.""</p>

<p>The example you gave from Lords of Madness is incredibly subjective however, as that belief is simply one shared/emphasized by the Aboleth-- it is part of their belief of the creation cycle.  </p>

<p>The Spelljammer setting often mentions a race of creator deities (the Jann or something like that) that spawned the main races and then disappeared.</p>

<p>My take on it is that (and correct me if the canonical sources decimate my argument as I am not as heavily immersed in them as you are-- I mean how do you remember all of this stuff, wow!) before the creation of mortals and the Outer Planes, the first deities (who were semi-primordial) were born from the Astral.  They creaqted the first mortal races, etc. and those mortal races spawned entire pantheons of powers through their beliefs.  As to how such beings could be born before the existence of mortals-- just because there are no mortals does not mean there is no belief.  There are numerous ways in which the first powers could have been born, including from the beliefs of aberrant... aberrations and Elder Evils, or from the nightmares of such beings *esp. ones insane by their standards-- remember that the Elder Evils have no concept of law, chaos, evil, good, or balance unless they have been heavily exposed to the ideas of the current multiverse, such as Ghaunadaur, The Patient One, and Tharizdun.*</p>

<p>""Elder Evils says that before the time of the gods was the time of primal forces, beings of godlike power but not dependent on mortal belief.""<br />
It is strongly alluded to in several 2E sources as well.  The thing is that very few of those elder evils/primal forces are still around, and most that are were imprisoned by the powers and quasi-powers (the only ones still around are those who adapted to and submitted to the new multiverse-- Ghaunadaur being the only true example I can think of at the moment, though the surviving Obyrith are also examples of such.)  The ones who remained Inimical to the new Multiverse were, of course, imprisoned (e.g. Tharizdun).  <br />
I do not think Tharizdun is quite as insane as people make him out to be.  I think his ultimate goal is not so much the destruction of all creation, but rather, the destruction of the current multiverse and all that has been tainted by it (which would likely include himself)  In other words, he wants a return to the way things were before the current Multiverse, to the Previous Age.<br />
This seems to be the goal of most of the antediluvian Elder Evils as well, and this is where I got the idea that there was a war between them and the newly-born powers of this Multiverse.<br />
Elder Evils (and LoM) states that the previous multiverse/age was ruled by different laws of physics.  You can imagine what would have had to take place in order to change that to the way it is now.  I doubt the Elder Evils would have allowed that change lying down.  <br />
We also know that this occurred very early during the creation cycle, because I remember one of the "Planes of--" books mentioning (sadly I am unable to find it again) that an entire Carceri Sphere, Abyss Layer, or Acheron Cube (can't remember which) was formed around the body of a Sleeping One (the sleeping ones are described in Inner Planes, in regards to the Paraelemental Plane of Ice)</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Much is made of the aboleths' perfect memories, however. </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>The Spelljammer setting often mentions a race of creator deities (the Jann or something like that) that spawned the main races and then disappeared.</div></p>

<p>No, you're thinking of the Juna. They're not deities; they're a race of three-sided aliens. They didn't spawn the main races; they just seeded them on the various worlds. They're just an incredibly ancient, powerful mortal race. </p>

<p>That's actually from <span style="font-style:italic">Fiendish Codex I: Hordes of the Abyss</span>, page 126. The 92nd layer of the Abyss, Ulgurshek, is a draeden, a type of being originally described in Frank Mentzer's <span style="font-style:italic">D&amp;D Immortal Set</span>, but very similar to (and, likely, identical to) the Sleeping Ones in the Paraelemental Plane of Ice. </p>

<p>The draedens did go to war against the earliest Immortals in their original context. The dispute was that the draedens hated matter and prefer to "swim" in planes of pure void, while the Immortals preferred planes of substance and form. The draedens lost and mostly went dormant, waiting for the entropy or disaster to destroy all the hated matter and leave the planes nothing but delicious void once again. Those draedens who remain active are normally found in the depths of space and the Astral Plane, where there is little substance to disturb them. </p>

<p>As I said, a lot depends on what your definition of a "god" is. The class of gods active in the multiverse today seem to be a relatively recent innovation, younger than the aboleths and obyriths. It was stated explicitly that obyriths such as Dagon existed before there were any gods. There do seem to have been godlike entities who were far older, however. If you wish to consider the primal beings who existed while the planes were first being formed "gods," that's probably valid, but they do seem to be a distinctly different class of beings from the gods known today. </p>

<p>The Far Realm exists beyond time - before the beginning and after the end of all things, outside the cycle of creation and destruction rather than before it. The primordials and "gods" are creatures born within Time, part of its great cycle. The beings called "Elder Evils" in the book of that name encompass many different classes of beings; some of them are Far Realm entities, some of them would be considered primordials in 4th edition, some would be considered gods or other entities. I would draw a sharp distinction between what Far Realm entities desire, which can vary, but primarily means shattering the circle of Time entirely and drawing everything into the Far Realm; what draedens desire, which is to return everything to a state of pure void, but not to shatter Time or interfere with the boundaries of the Far Realm at all; and what primordials desire, which is to return the mortal world to a state of primal chaos, not void. </p>

<p>There were probably a lot of different ways multiverse could have developed after creation, and a lot of the early conflict had to do with determining what the laws of nature would be, or if nature would even have laws. <span style="font-style:italic">Guide to Hell</span>'s creation myth describes the Twin Serpents decreeing the Rule of Threes, Unity of Rings, and Center of All precepts. I'd treat this as metaphor, but something like this probably happened, with the Astral forces imposing order and physics on elemental Chaos. That's a different struggle than the one with the draedens, though, and different from the conflict with the Far Realm entities (which haven't yet been able to invade in force). </p>

<p>As a rough timeline: </p>

<p>The Far Realm doesn't really fit into the timeline at all. It attempts to impinge itself upon Time-bound reality, but hasn't completely succeeded. If it did succeed, all history would cease to exist and every event would be drawn into the nonlinear existence of the Far Realm. There may be a rupture at the end of time, and before the beginning of time, when the Far Realm is more accessible and the boundaries between the multiverse and the Realm Outside are more or less meaningless, but if the Far Realm ever completely won, the multiverse would be unable to recreate itself. </p>

<p>At the beginning of time, the planes were formless and void. The draedens existed. At some point they came into conflict with the forces that created the elements and the planes of alignment, and went into dormancy.</p>

<p>As per 4th edition, there may have been some sort of conflict between the primordial ancestors of the elementals, who preferred substance to be in a state of chaotic flux with no permanent forms, and with the first Astral beings who desired stability and form. The elemental beings would have been as opposed to the draedens as their Astral counterparts, since both preferred substance to pure void. This may evolve into the 3rd edition war between the Wind Dukes and the obyriths, though the Wind Dukes were originally elemental beings and the obyriths are apparently from the Abyss. I think there may have been a war between the current elemental rulers, who wished to divide the elemental chaos into discrete planes (and succeeded), and other elemental beings who desired the Inner Planes to remain an indistinguishable mix. </p>

<p>That brings us to the present age, when most of the planes are filled with substance and form and a certain amount of stability holds sway. </p>

<p>That's three different conflicts, and three different Ages, though all take place within the current multiverse. There may have been other cycles of the Multiverse, but only the leShay are thought to have survived from previous multiverses.  </p>

<p>It's been suggested that Tharizdun and Ghaunadaur are beings from the Far Realm, though this hasn't been verified. Tharizdun seems, like the draedens, to wish to reduce everything to pure void. Unlike the draedens, he doesn't want anything to survive, even himself. He simply wants the universe to end; there's no indication he desires the Far Realm to assimilate it, however. Ghaunadaur doesn't seem to have any goals other than madness.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>I am well aware.  They are different classes of beings indeed, but they all possess similar goals and qualities.<br />
1. They are inimical to all matter and life in this Multiverse<br />
2. They wish to reform this Multiverse, usually either to be more like the Far Realm, or, more commonly, to what it was before or earlier into the current creation cycle (e.g. one of the Elder Evils is a Baatorian who wants revenge on both the Baatezu and mortals, for sealing it away.) <br />
The bit about the Far Realm existing beyond time, though, what source exactly did you get this from?  Because from what I've read thus far from 2E Firestorm Peak to Elder Evils, there isn't really an official concensus on what the Far Realm actually is exactly (aside that it's completely separate from this Multiverse).<br />
Though outside the cycle of creation and destruction is generally the idea I had in mind as well (in other words, the elemental sages are incorrect that spacial rifts opening to the Far-Realm are time portals)</p>

<p>That's actually from Fiendish Codex I: Hordes of the Abyss, page 126. The 92nd layer of the Abyss, Ulgurshek, is a draeden, a type of being originally described in Frank Mentzer's D&amp;D Immortal Set, but very similar to (and, likely, identical to) the Sleeping Ones in the Paraelemental Plane of Ice. <br />
Ah, very interesting.  That begs the question as to why the Kuo-Toa think the draeden are the creator gods of the Multiverse, however, when they seem to be the very opposite.</p>

<p>""As per 4th edition, there may have been some sort of conflict between the primordial ancestors of the elementals, who preferred substance to be in a state of chaotic flux with no permanent forms, and with the first Astral beings who desired stability and form.""</p>

<p>4th Edition Primordials make absolutely no sense, however, because now the elemental planes are chaotically, rather than neutrally aligned, and we're expected to believe this has always been the case.  That's a SIGNIFICANT retcon.  <br />
Also, it flies in the face of the Rod of 7 Parts story, where all but the Earth-aligned planes became bastions of civilization for some time, and the elemental planes were split down the middle between chaos and law.  This is why I hate encorporating 4E fluff into previous editions.  It absolutely makes zero sense.  (another good example is Ioun.  In 1E-3E this was the name of the region between the borders of Positive Energy and Quasielemental Mineral *or in 3E, Elemental Earth*.  In 4E it is the name of a powerful, well-known, and significant goddess of wisdom, and 4E claims it's been that way since the time/era of all previous editions.  4E from what I've heard also makes no attempts to explain how the multiverse's scales became tipped heavily towards chaos and the cosmology got so messed up.  At least for 3E they made a half-assed attempt at an explaintion.)</p>

<p>""It's been suggested that Tharizdun and Ghaunadaur are beings from the Far Realm, though this hasn't been verified."" </p>

<p>As I'm well aware.  And now that you mention it, Tharizdun's goals do indeed seem very draeden-ish.  <br />
Ghaunadaur I think is antediluvian/previous age like the Aboleths, though the Aboleths believe (I can't remember which sources claim this however) that they were created by powers of the Far-Realm, either intentionally or by accident (I think this is disputed among them.  I remember one source specifically stating that the Aboleth believe they and the Multiverse were created by accident when a far-realm power brushed against the border between this world and the Far-Realm.).</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I don't imagine the kuo-toa are a very reliable source for events that happened long before their species existed, but the draedens are probably the first living creatures in the multiverse, and deserve a certain amount of creator credit for that alone, like beings in mythology like Tiamat and Ymir who resisted further creation but unwillingly played a role in it.</p>

<p>The idea that the Far Realm exists outside time, before the beginning and after its end, is from the third edition Manual of the Planes.</p>

<p>I would place the primordials chronologically before the formation of the modern inner planar structure, and before the birth of the Wind Dukes, before any order was brought to the inner planes.</p>

<p>The origin of ioun stones is another point of divergence between the Forgotten Realms and other 2e settings, because in FR Ioun was an ancient Netherese wizard who created the first ioun stones.</p>

<p>The 4th edition Forgotten Realms campaign guide suggests Ghaunadaur is from the Far Realm, but that might be the first time this suggestion was made.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>""The 4th edition Forgotten Realms campaign guide suggests Ghaunadaur is from the Far Realm, but that might be the first time this suggestion was made.""</p>

<p>Not quite.  LoM posited that Tharizdun, Ghaunadaur, and The Patient One might be a triad of 3 aspects of the same deity/entity.  This seems highly unlikely to me, however.<br />
I strongly doubt that Ghaunadaur is from the Far Realm. While it's true that he causes insanity or feeble-mind to everything he touches, he isn't inimical to Multiverse life like Far Realm entities are, and doesn't share their goals.  So if he is from the Far Realm, his mind has been so polluted with ideas from this Multiverse (example: his clerics have access to the evil and chaos domains), that he can scarcely be considered an Elder Evil, let alone a being of the Far Realm (in other words, he's been naturalized to this multiverse).<br />
Tharizdun problably isn't from the Far Realm either-- as ripvanwormer pointed out, he is probably an insane Draeden who achieved deity status.</p>

<p>I should mention that this is a major difference between primordial/Elder Evil-eque powers of this Multiverse and natives of the Far Realm in the canon (though I do not think they mentioned it directly).  The Far Realm and antediluvian beings have no concept of evil, good, law, chaos, or balance, and, though they may be listed as evil- or chaotically- aligned for gaming purposes, they do not offer such domains to their clerical cultists or arcane devotee cultists.  Those which have been heavily exposed to the ideas of this multiverse (Tharizdun, Ghaunadaur, etc.) are an entirely different matter of course, and do indeed offer these clerical domains.  (There may be other 3x sources that contradict this unspoken rule, but it is definitely the case in LoM.)</p>

<p>Anyhow, with all this information, I'll probably edit the Elementals' creation story to some degree.</p>

<p>Back to the creator deities/first deities that I posited, I believe they likely would have been primordial beings like you intitially mentioned "that exist independent of belief", but not quite.  They would be more akin to the Elemental Lords (Kossuth, Istishia, Akadi, and Grumbar), who can benefit significantly from belief (Kossuth is the most worshipped by mortals and as a result is an intermediate rather than lesser deity like his brothers and sister), but would not "die" were they to be entirely deprived of worshippers.  It could even explain why these first powers would have gone to the trouble to create the Multiverse (or at least the first sentient races).  This would have exhausted them and left them weak in the short-run, but in the long run they would end up more powerful from worship.  Unfortunately, they likely did not anticipate that the mortals would create their own personal deities from belief. <br />
Of course, I do not think the origins of the multiverse should be clear-cut even to the DM, so it's nice to have conflicting stories as we do.  Mortal clerics, the powers, and the outsiders of the Upper Planes claim one thing, the sages and aberrations claim another, and the beings of the Lower Planes claim something else.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>I see a pattern that might be like a wheel of ages, where it's something like Draeden/whatever came from the void first, who were usurped by the Primordials, who were then usurped by the Gods, who will then be usurped by the Mortals, and then the void comes again.</p>

<p>Still I see that the Primordials would still have their supporters beyond possibly those who draw upon the Elemental power source, as certainly some of the Factions (Doomguard, Xaosmen, possibly Anarchists and Athar, and maybe even some Guvners) and Sects (the Primals) would be more sympathetic to them than others.  </p>

<p>As for the Obyriths in 4e, one of the design articles mentions that now they are invaders from another cosmos who were the Seed of Evil that Tharizdun cast in the chaos.  In some ways it reminds my of the article on the Ecology of the Sharn, where the Sharn are the Juna survivors of an alternate reality that Tharizdun destroyed.  Of course I'd take all of these as a myth, and not the actual truth as set in stone.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>I use what I deem as interesting.  While there are many things boring about the World Axis in general that should be ditched in favour of the Great Wheel in Planescape 4e, some of the backstory is interesting enough to use for Planescape 4e.</p>

<p>Anyways I like the concept of a Wheel of Ages happening.  It matches up with similar concepts in Hinduism and Greek Mythology.  Primordials fit in with the myth-mash of having all these differing pantheons existing together in the multiverse.  </p>

<p>Some might have different views of how reality was like back then.  Though as I have stated that there's something universal about 'Primordials' based in many culture's myths, and that some cultures have a concept of a conflict between Gods and Primordials like the Aesir vs. Giants, Olympians vs. Titans or Devas vs. Asuras (Hindu myth not the races as they are in D&amp;D).  There's a strong myth archetype, that it fits in that myth-mash of having the Greek, Babylonian, Norse, Yoruban, Hindu, Chinese and whatever pantheons existing together.  And I'm aware that those pantheons and their myths in general tend to contradict a lot of D&amp;D canon to begin with, as they aren't the Oerth or Torilian pantheon either.  </p>

<p>With all those pantheons existing together, it makes sense that there were certain key events that happened in the ancient past that have resonated in this shared mythspace, that have been interpreted in different ways by many cultures.  Having the Age of the Primordials as the "Golden Age" would be a more than ironic twist on the general 4e party-line about them.  Back in that ancient age, maybe it was "Golden" because there was nothing from the Far Realms making an incursion in the multiverse.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

Except that the Elemental Lords, Archomentals, and others have been changed from that to Primordials, which is what the Titans have been placed in as well.</p>

<p>""Though as I have stated that there's something universal about 'Primordials' based in many culture's myths, and that some cultures have a concept of a conflict between Gods and Primordials like the Aesir vs. Giants, Olympians vs. Titans or Devas vs. Asuras""<br />
Except that the elementals don't really fit in with all of that.  There is no hint at a major conflict between the elemental lords &amp; archomentals and the current pantheons.<br />
There's no way that the elemental lords would be primordials since they most certainly predate the Titans, Formorians, etc. by far (as the elemental planes, ethereal, and astral were the first planes to come into existence.  Only after that did the Outer Planes and the Prime come into being from a seeping of the various elements, paraelements, and quasielements.)</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>There might well have been an ancient war between the elemental lords and the original progenitors of the Outer Planes (the forces who created the baernaloths and their good, lawful, and chaotic equivalents), but the current pantheons wouldn't have been involved.</p>

         <p>The point of myths is that they don't necessarily tell the truth about what happened across the planes.  Take for example the creation of the Human race...  In many cases not consistent across all the myths.  It could be some Gods crafting something with clay and casting it across the planes as Humans.  Or maybe some Primordial created an amorphous mass that evolved into Humans.</p>

<p>And the thing is, that the concept of "Ones who came before" resonate across many cultures.  It's clearly something that isn't quite ignored.  And while anything that opposes the Gods tends to get cast in a negative light, doesn't mean that they are careless destroying beings against all life.  Also some retcons are interesting, some aren't.  There may be something interesting in the retcon that the Primordials defeated the Gods on Athas, beyond the previous explanation of "the Grey is a barrier blocking contact with the Outer Planes".  But then the previous might be a myth explaining the later.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

To an extent.  However, as far as outsider races and elementals go, the eldest of them are more likely to know the truth about some of the creation stories.<br />
Particularly the four Elemental Lords.</p>

<p>""The point of myths is that they don't necessarily tell the truth about what happened across the planes.""<br />
No, but in 2E and 3E, there were particular versions that appeared to be the 'actual' truth.<br />
For instance, it's generally accepted by fans/DMs that the Aberrations' version of the creation myth is the correct one.  That is to say, the powers came into existence due to the belief of the newly-born slave races of the Neogi, Illithid, and Aboleth. <br />
It's also generally accepted that the Ethereal and Inner Planes came into existence first (though debatable which of the two came first-- I'm of the opinion that the Ethereal created the Inner Planes and not the other way around, because there's nothing in the Inner Planes that could have formed the building blocks of the Ethereal-- the elements themselves are muted in the Ethereal.)  The Ethereal (Possibility) came first, giving birth to the Elemental Planes (energy &amp; matter) and the Astral (belief).  From the Astral would have come the very first primordial powers (very different from today), and the draedens, along with likely other (non-power) creatures composed of pure belief given life or sentience.  Also at this time would be born the elementals and Elemental powers (Kossuth, Istishia, Akadi, Grumbar)<br />
Somewhere down the line we end up with the antediluvian aberration races such as the aboleth, and Far Realm-eque powers such as Great Mother.  <br />
Eventually, the Illithidae time-shift to this era, and bring a whole lot of stuff with them, including the ancestral races of most mortal races we see today.<br />
Through the power of belief, these mortals create the first powers, which would be the likes of Titans, divine giants, and such.  It would be at this time when the Outer Planes begin to form, and when we see the appearance of the primordial deities such as Ghaunadaur, Tharizdun, and The Patient One.<br />
It would still be thousands of years before events such as the Law-Chaos war, the Firestorm Peak/Elder Elves/Far Realm gate rift, and ancient Netheril, and at least centuries before Asmodeus falls from grace.  </p>

<p>""Also some retcons are interesting, some aren't.

But then the previous might be a myth explaining the later.""</p>

<p>I thought the story behind Athas was that The Grey was erected by the stellar gods such as Celestian and Ptah to isolate Defiler Magic and prevent it from spreading to other spheres.  That makes a lot more sense to me than Primordials defeating the gods of the Athasian Crystal Sphere, since neither one (save whatever crazy-ass "I wanna destroy all existence" member or two of the Athasian pantheon there might have been) would want Defiler magic to exist, as it would eventually cause a dramatic reduction in potential worshippers.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Well, sure. But the majority of gods won't know, and the PCs are unlikely to ever know a lot of what the elemental lords know, so I don't think it much matters for most purposes. And even if the Elemental Lords remember how things <span style="font-style:italic">used</span> to be, that doesn't mean reality itself won't have changed the past around them, in defiance of their memories... see below for more on this idea.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>For instance, it's generally accepted by fans/DMs that the Aberrations' version of the creation myth is the correct one.</div></p>

<p>I accept it, though from some unscientific polls I've done, I don't think it's generally accepted. Not that these things are determined democratically. </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>I'm of the opinion that the Ethereal created the Inner Planes and not the other way around,</div></p>

<p>Me too. Probably the Inner Planes began as demiplanes and eventually blossomed into full planes. I've seen some people argue fervently otherwise, however. </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Through the power of belief, these mortals create the first powers, which would be the likes of Titans, divine giants, and such.

<p>I think the first powers would be the deities of the amphibious peoples, who are likely to have been the first aboleth slave races.  Ramenos and Blibdoolpoolp are the chief survivors of this era. Ghaunadaur would likely have been around in this era, too, along with the primordial slime creatures. </p>

<p>The early amphibious gods might have gone on to create new species, including mammalian ones, who eventually created their own gods. </p>

<p>The Law-Chaos war likely began before the creation of mortal life (the obyriths, at least, are explicitly older than mortals or gods), though it didn't end until the mortal races were well-established. If you believe <span style="font-style:italic">Fiendish Codex II</span>, Asmodeus's fall was a result of the Law-Chaos war, his fervor for destroying obyriths causing him and his allies to become more like them, eventually becoming baatezu. 4th edition's <span style="font-style:italic">Demonomicon</span> claims that Pazuzu corrupted Asmodeus personally. Which, I suppose, is possible. </p>

<p>In a way, the Law-Chaos war is still going on, since the Blood War is a continuation of it. The beginning of the Blood War noted in the <span style="font-style:italic">Hellbound</span> timeline should be read as the beginning of the Law-Chaos war, since later events on that timeline like the appearance of the planar lords, the exploration of the planes, and the first use of petitioners to replenish planar races undoubtedly preceded the Battle of Pesh. And on that timeline, the first appearance of the gods and the first use of petitioners in that way are a long, long time (millennia, at least) after the Blood War began. </p>

<p>I'd place the aboleth empire, then, some time in the middle of the Law-Chaos conflict. The warring obyriths, vaati, and proto-devils probably ignore it at first, until the gods created by uplifted mortal races begin to interfere with their battles. They finally begin to conquer the Material Plane, and the Battle of Pesh, which changes the planar order, happens only after millennia of that.</p>

<p>I'm not clear on when the illithid empire (called Nihiliath in 4th edition) fell. A long time ago, certainly, and before the birth of the more ancient of the modern pantheons ("before the crowning of Ra"). Before the dawn of the Green Age of Athas between 74,000 and 14,000 years ago, when psionics bloomed on that world after a githzerai mind-bomb created the degenerate gith.  And more than 12,000 years ago, when illithids from Glyth founded the city of Oryndoll on Toril. But it couldn't have fallen before the birth of humanity, since the gith races are human-descended. </p>

<p>I'd say beings like Cronus, Ra, Lendor, the jotuns and so on are relatively recent in multiversal terms, but although much older than the young gods in their respective pantheons. They emerge only with the birth of ancient human civilizations. The question here is whether the ancient pantheons emerged all at once, fully formed, with the titans <span style="font-style:italic">already</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">always</span> defeated, or if there was actually a period before the dawn of civilization when humanity worshiped titans instead of younger gods. Perhaps Cronus and his siblings were <span style="font-style:italic">created</span> in Carceri, complete with a history and memories of once having reigned in Arborea. They're no older than the myth cycle from which they emerged, and thus no older than the Olympians who are their supposed descendants.</p>

<p>It's tempting to put the primordials of 4th edition at this point, contemporaneous with the titans, so that they can fulfill the same role in the fictional D&amp;D pantheons that titans, jotuns, Tiamat, and so forth fill in the historical D&amp;D pantheons. And ignore any idea that they're the same as the elemental rulers. You get the same question here, of course. Were the primordials ever free, or was the great battle between primordials and gods already over when the two camps sprung into existence? </p>

<p>My inclination is toward the latter view. Mual-Tar was always chained; his chains have existed as long as he has. But Mual-Tar himself, and the gods who chained him, remember things differently. They remember a false history created by belief. </p>

<p>Ancient Netheril, of course, are much later. I associate the Elder Elves who opened the Vast Gate with the inhabitants of the Sinking Isle on Oerth, who would have lived more than 5,000 years ago (before the beginning of the elven calendar), but I have no idea how <span style="font-style:italic">much</span> more.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>I think the only Spelljammer book that mentions Athas is <span style="font-style:italic">The Complete Spacefarer's Handbook</span>. It doesn't offer an explanation for why Athas is inaccessible, and doesn't even say that it definitely is. What the book says is "Whether it is unreachable by spelljammer or merely so far from these worlds that any journey would take lifetimes is unknown."</p>

<p>I think the explanation that Hyena gives above is fanon.</p>

<p>It's likely that defiler magic doesn't even work outside Athas's crystal sphere (since crystal spheres often have their own unique magic systems). It doesn't really make sense that it would, when you think about it. The way magic works on Athas, whether by preservers or defilers, is by draining the life from surrounding living things. It's not possible to do magic on Athas without doing this. Preservers do this slowly, in a way that can be renewed. Defilers do it quickly and blight the landscape around them. Magic on other worlds doesn't have any inherent effect on the surrounding life. It comes from other planes, typically the energy planes, or it flows across the land in ley lines, or from the moons, or in the form of Toril's Weave. A defiler on Toril would use the Weave the same as anyone else, and would be limited to using magic the same way other wizards use it. No matter how hard they pushed their spells, life would be unaffected. If they shot a tree with a fireball or a negative energy burst, they could kill it, but a non-defiler could do that just as easily.</p>

<p>However, Planescape mentions that defiling magic works in the Outer Planes. Perhaps because defilers believe it does. You can do magic in the Outer Planes by whatever system you brought from your world of origin (modified by whatever constraints are put in place by that plane or realm), so a wizard from Athas corrupts the landscape, a wizard from Toril draws from the Weave, and a Wizard of High Sorcery from Krynn is affected by the waxing and waning of their world's distant moons. But if you move to a world, you're bound by whatever the local system of magic is, so a Wizard of High Sorcery from Krynn has to draw from the Weave instead of Krynn's moons while visiting Toril. A wizard from Toril can benefit from Oerth's ley lines but not Cerilia's (since Cerilia's ley lines require divine blood to use). A wizard from any other world, while visiting Athas, has to draw magic from the surrounding vegetation, and can learn to defile while on that planet.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>4e explanation of arcane magic has all arcane casters taking in spirit energy to power their spells.  Defilers are ones who simply found a harsh shortcut of doing it, in that they are quickly sucking up the spirit energy and not letting it flow back.  Because it's 'spirit energy' it's also a justification of why defiling inflicts 1/2 of an allies healing surge damage (that's 1/8 of their HP total) to them, beyond the out of character excuse of game balance.</p>

<p>I personally don't think that defiling magic works out of Athas either.  Possible because the spirit energy outside, is just too much for them to suck up in anyway that's permanently damaging to what's around them.</p>

<p>As for the ancient past for the rest of the planes, I like to refer to ages long since forgotten, and one of them is the Eon of Wyrms.  When most of the sentient beings of the multiverse were reptilian, such as the Naga, when Dragons were a young race.  I envision many of the significant Nagas such as Vasuki, Ananta Sesha, Mucalinda, Jörmungandr, Apeps, Nüwa and more are ancient powers that very well could be a bunch of primordials whether good or bad.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>""I'm not clear on when the illithid empire (called Nihiliath in 4th edition) fell. A long time ago, certainly, and before the birth of the more ancient of the modern pantheons ("before the crowning of Ra").""<br />
Well, yes, Ra is part of the modern pantheon, so it would be before him.</p>

<p>""I'd say beings like Cronus, Ra, Lendor, the jotuns and so on are relatively recent in multiversal terms,""<br />
Agreed.</p>

<p>""or if there was actually a period before the dawn of civilization when humanity worshiped titans instead of younger gods.<br />
I'd go with this one.</p>

<p>""That's never been in any DS canon I ever seen. That's sounds more like something that came SJ which is nothing more than an interpretation of how things might have happened. DS canon never even mentions any deities by name.""</p>

<p>The names given were by using what general info we get from Spelljammer-- the Grey would have had to be erected by powers that could exist in the Phlogistan, particularly by powers for whom the galaxy and crystal spheres in general is part of their portfolio.  It probably did come from Fanon, however.</p>

<p>""Magic on other worlds doesn't have any inherent effect on the surrounding life. It comes from other planes, typically the energy planes, or it flows across the land in ley lines, or from the moons, or in the form of Toril's Weave.""</p>

<p>In practice, yes.  In theory it would be possible since most real-life cultures have folklore about "warlocks" and "black magick" practitioners who fuel their magic with the life-energy of other creatures, and this (along with curses) was used to explain the existence of plan diseases.  There are more than 6 separate diseases known in English-speaking countries as "witch's blight", for instance.  Many qi/chi cultivation schools also talk about and admonish people who suck the chi out of trees and then use it (which kills said tree)<br />
Defiler and preserver magic in Dark Sun is based directly on this system and on white magick in many new age religions, who claim that their magick works with the forces of nature/balance or even restores them.  Among many of these covens, the definition of "black Magick" and the "left handed path" not only includes magick that causes harm and subverts the will, but also any magick that causes imbalance.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>The names given were by using what general info we get from Spelljammer-- the Grey would have had to be erected by powers that could exist in the Phlogistan, particularly by powers for whom the galaxy and crystal spheres in general is part of their portfolio.</div></p>

<p>Any god can exist within the Phlogiston, though none of them have the ability to contact other planes within that realm. Not even Celestian or Ptah.  The Grey is (according to <span style="font-style:italic">A Guide to the Ethereal Plane</span>) nothing more than a variant Border Ethereal; any entity modifying it would have to do so from within the crystal sphere, or from the Ethereal Plane itself. Of the two you mention, Ptah has the closest ties with the Ethereal Plane (since it's where he dwells), so he would be the most likely candidate. Celestian, as a second-generation (at the oldest) Oeridian deity, is probably not very old even in divine terms, perhaps closer to the 1,200-2,500 year-old Heironeous and Hextor in antiquity. Ptah, being the deification of the primordial mound, is likely older than Ra, but I'd hesitate before identifying him as the ancient being who created the Grey.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>In practice, yes. In theory it would be possible since most real-life cultures have folklore about "warlocks" and "black magick" practitioners who fuel their magic with the life-energy of other creatures, and this (along with curses) was used to explain the existence of plan diseases. There are more than 6 separate diseases known in English-speaking countries as "witch's blight", for instance. Many qi/chi cultivation schools also talk about and admonish people who suck the chi out of trees and then use it (which kills said tree)
Defiler and preserver magic in Dark Sun is based directly on this system and on white magick in many new age religions, who claim that their magick works with the forces of nature/balance or even restores them. Among many of these covens, the definition of "black Magick" and the "left handed path" not only includes magick that causes harm and subverts the will, but also any magick that causes imbalance.</div></p>

<p>Given the themes of the Dark Sun setting, I think Defiling and preserver magic is more of a fantasy metaphor for the way modern industry affects the environment of our own world, and I'm skeptical that Dark Sun's creators were very familiar with Chinese geomancy or other such things. In any case, magic is given different explanations on other campaign worlds that are pretty incompatible with the idea of defiling magic. Therefore, I don't think Ptah would have any particular need or desire to cut Athasspace from the other worlds. </p>

<p>There are spells already in D&amp;D that seem more directly the equivalent of witch's blight and the like (for example, <span style="font-style:italic">Diminish Plants</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Unholy Blight</span>). This seems more like shooting a plant with a <span style="font-style:italic">fireball</span> than defiling magic. </p>

<p>However, if the concept behind defiling is as culturally universal as you suggest, then it should already be found in many other worlds, regardless of whether or not Athas is sealed off from other spheres. Sealing off Athas to prevent the spread of defiling magic would be like sealing off Oerth to prevent the spread of elves.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>""Given the themes of the Dark Sun setting, I think Defiling and preserver magic is more of a fantasy metaphor for the way modern industry affects the environment of our own world, and I'm skeptical that Dark Sun's creators were very familiar with Chinese geomancy or other such things.""</p>

<p>Those were simply examples I gave.  There are plenty more, from every civilization and culture throughout history.  The only difference is how the traditional cultures and civilizations explained it and how the new-age white magick covens explain it.</p>

<p>The latter more or less claim that the 'life force' is sucked out by the practitioner and used as magickal energy, whereas the basic superstition/logic in the past was that the lives of the plants (much like animals and humans) were sacrificed to evil spirits to fuel magickal power.<br />
You are likely partially right in that the Defiler vs. Preserver magic is probably in part a metaphor of industrialization, but I believe it is also a metaphor of ethics and economic success in general.  In life, the best rewards come from doing things that are difficult and take a long time to pay off, as opposed to instant, short-term gratification.  This is particularly the case when it comes to ethics, as the right course of action (in most ethical systems) is usually the most difficult.  The preserver has to sacrifice personal gain and much of the power they COULD have for the sake of future generations.</p>

<p>""There are spells already in D&amp;D that seem more directly the equivalent of witch's blight and the like (for example, Diminish Plants and Unholy Blight). This seems more like shooting a plant with a fireball than defiling magic.""<br />
No, it's not the same because the caster has to actually give up something in order to use those spells (a daily spell slot, that is, and possible material components).  Were this truer to witch's blight, they'd actually GAIN an additional spell slot.  Or to be more specific, their prayer or meditation would result in the sickness and death of plants, animals, and even people in order to gain their daily allotted spells.  <br />
BoVD has somewhat of a system for this, but it stresses the sacrifice of sentient beings.  Also, depending on the version of the superstition, the witch need not even be in the immediate area of the plants to be sacrificed, let alone manipulate them directly (kill them, burn them, touch them, etc.)  In some versions all they have to do is perform a ritual to the devil or to some other evil spirit in a nearby forest or cave, and Farmer John's apple orchard will wither away and die, and the witch/etc. will have the life energy of said plants to fuel a spell to bring him/herself good luck, properity, health, or fame.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>And it's not like Athas really is sealed off as there are mutated Githyanki on Athas, the Psurlons come from there, and there's that whole thing about Orcus visiting Athas so that he could get a Rhulisti-made lifeshaped body back when the Last Word was killing him.</p>

<p>And one thing about the ancient past, is that at one time all of the worlds of the prime existed may have existed as one world.  An infinitely flat world where one could walk from primordial Toril to primordial Mystara and reach the expanse of the blue Rhulisti oceans of primordial Athas.  And then at one point a Great War fought over the whole of creation happened, and the infinite world was shattered into an infinity of pieces, and the different pieces sealed off from the void as battle-lines were being drawn.  Most of the worlds being made round, so that mortals wouldn't easily learn they lived in fragments of a greater world.</p>

         <p>""the Psurlons come from there""<br />
No, the Psurlons come from the Far-Realm.</p>

<p>""At least that myth might explain why so many worlds seem to share common races, that know little of each other.""</p>

<p>Actually, it's already been explained in the canon that there were Spelljamming and planar portal diasporas tens of thousands of years ago, which most of the races have long forgotten of.  This is why so many worlds share so much identical plant AND animal life as well.  You have to figure that communication between mages of the main 3 AD&amp;D worlds has been going on for a lot longer than Elminster, Mordenkainen, and what's-his-face have been around.<br />
This is supported by the story of the Elder Elves, who more or less got bored with the Inner/Outer planes and spheres (hence their attempt to "pierce the spaces between these planes")</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>Hyena of Ice</em> wrote:</div>No, the Psurlons come from the Far-Realm.</div></p>

<p>The original back story for the psurlons, from the <span style="font-style:italic">Dark Sun Monstrous Compendium II</span>, is that many thousands of years ago they originated on a world other than Athas. They tried to link the minds of their entire species together, but a psychic backlash caused a massive rift to the Astral Plane to open up and destroy their world. As a race, they have come to accept their new home in the Astral Plane and have no desire to go anywhere else, but individual psurlons have noted that Athas may be able to survive the psychic forces that destroyed their original home, and are interested in repeating their experiment there. That said, the book says they're only found on Athas if summoned there. </p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Lords of Madness</span> claims the psurlons originated in the Far Realm, but doesn't offer an explanation for why they left it. In the absence of any compelling Far Realm-related story, I'd prefer to go by their original version. They're not necessarily mutually exclusive - they could have originated in the Far Realm, colonized a world on the Material Plane, and then destroyed that. Or the world they destroyed could have been part of the Far Realm. But I don't see where that adds anything interesting to the race. I do like the Mak Thuum Ngatha connection.</p>

<p>Of course, there are Athasian elves in Pelion, and there's the Athasian ghetto, New Tyr, in Sigil (and Athasian halflings have been spotted in Sigil's halfling neighborhood, too). Dregoth, Ravager of Giants, left Athas to explore the Outer Planes during the 168th King's Age. Ancient githyanki tried to conquer Athas approximately 14,000 years ago, and invaded again in Free Year 6. The Grey obstructs planar travel without making it impossible.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>To make things even more confusing, the Planescape MCIII claims they are 'native' to the Astral...<br />
While certainly "native" can mean "born in" under one definition, this only refers to people as citizens and is not used in an ecological sense (ecologically, the same term would be "naturalized" for the Psurlon in this sense-- a term that anyone who doesn't read field guides on a regular basis won't be familiar with, and the term is generally the opposite of 'invasive'.).  So presumably the writers of the PSMCIII meant "native" as the definition synomatous with "indigenous".</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>The PSMCIII is actually pretty close to the DSMCII. It says "Psurlons were once natives of a prime-material world, the name of which is now lost," and recounts that it was destroyed by the giant psurlons. The handful that survived fled to the Astral. It also calls the psurlons "newcomers to the Astral Plane (relatively speaking)."

         <p>And I seem to recall that Psurlons were also so-called "canon-immigrants" from the 1st Dark Sun CRPG, that made it into the DSMCII.
