</div> <p><span style="text-decoration:underline">The Forest of Silence and the Realm of the Silent King</span></p>

<p>This forest lies in the outlands, in the regions nearing the evil outer planes, tending slightly to a chaotic nature. At first glance it looks like a normal wood or dark green pines and a few other trees, though lacking any undergrowth, giving it the appearance of a wide and dark hall full of pillars. There are always hanging thin strands of silvery mist between the trees. <br />
Those who enter the forest will quickly discover its true nature: the forest is always totally silent. Neither footsteps nor clanking weapons seem to produce any sound and the forest seems to be completely devoid of any of the sounds animals would produce. In fact, it is impossible to create any sound in this forest, even with magical means of any kind or strenght, with one exception: those entering can speak normally, although the words seem muffled and only carry a few feet before being swallowed by the eternal silence.<br />
When carefully watching the forest, one might notice that it in fact has animals in it, although only one kind: Ravens. While at first visitors may spot a single, large raven sitting on a tree and visiting them with strange, green eyes, their number increases the deeper one enters until there are dozens or more of the birds silently watching from the treetops. <br />
Anyone who spends more than an hour in the forest and goes in deep enough to lose sight of the surrounding plains will get lost in the endless forest. In fact, only those with a very strong will (DC 25) may discern that powerful magic, both illusion and enchantment, veils the way out of the forest and lures them deeper in. <br />
In the center of the forest lays a small clearing. about ten steps across, the sky above which seems to be constantly dark and covered by thick, silvery mist through which only a few lonely stars can be seen. In the center of the clearing stands a large, white boulder, about as tall as a full-grown man. A small, clear spring of water flows from the top of the boulder down on all sides, forming a small but deep pond in front of it. Above the pond and covered by a thin film of water are blue carvings, slightly glowing in the starlight, which say in the sylvan language:<br />
„Enter the water stranger, for it's gentle touch will heal your wounds and reveal to you the way to the other side, the realm of the Silent King.“<br />
Anyone entering the water will indeed find that the water is enjoyable cool and slowly heals all wounds suffered, curing two points of damage per turn. He will also automatically discover a dark archway in the stone which wasn't visible before, which is in fact a one-way portal.<br />
On the other side of the portal lies what appears to be a giant hall, with hundreds of pillars rising up from the ground and vanishing in a cloud of mist before a ceiling can be seen. No two collums are the same, some made from rare woods, others from blue, green, white or black stone, but all are carved into various shapes. <br />
After a few moments the herald, one of the inhabitants of this place, will appear, without producing any sound as he approaches, to greet any newcomers. The herald looks like a very tall and slender elf, his skin snow-white, his hair black as the darkest night and his eyes of a bright green colour. In his hands he will carry a long staff of white wood with a black figurine depicting a raven on top. He will gently greet any newcomers in a whispered tone, asking them to accompany him to meet the king. If they agree, he will lead them out of the hallway to a smaller but still very large room of white marble. This room, the throne room, has high, slender windows, showing a dark forest in deepest night all around. In the middle of the room stands a huge throne of pure silver. On the throne sits a creature vaguely resembling an elf, but more than ten feet tall. The figure has skin in the bright, silvery colour of the moon and pitch-black hair, like the herald. He also sports long, black and feathery wings on his back, looking like those of a raven, and two long, black horns on his forehead. He wears a crown of mithril with three glowing stones in it, one blue, one green and one black and seems to be sleeping. After a few moments the herald will inform the visitors that the king is sleeping at the moment and will ask them to wait with their request to him, simply ignoring any objections of the visitors about not having any requests to the king or not wanting to wait. He will explain that they are now invited to join the feast, which is prepared in the next hall. <br />
If the visitors follow him, they will find a large table with about two dozen creatures, male and female, but all similar to the herald in appearance, sitting on it and covered in food and drinks looking most delicious. After the meal the visitors will be offered quarters. If they decline, the herald will simply ignore and lead them to the quarters anyway, insisting that they will have to sleep here and wait until the king wakes up.<br />
In fact, the Silent King is a powerful being born from the union of a mighty fey queen and a powerful fiend of unknown nature. Not much is known about him, except that a powerful curse was placed on both him and his realm. He will sleep forever and his realm forever stuck in the same routine, without any of the inhabitants registering this, just waiting for their king to wake up. Any visitors entering the realm will find it difficult to leave. The only apparent portal, the one they entered through, is one-way and other portals, even though they exist, are carefully hidden in the huge and confusing palace. Any question asked to the fey about this will yield the same answer: „Wait until the king wakes up, he will answer all your questions.“ In fact, after a certain time the visitors will start to like this place and in fact lose the will to leave it at all. Even after finding a portal, to be able to leave the place, a creature has to succeed on a will save of DC 15, which increases by +1 every time the creature spends a night in the realm or eats from one of the daily feasts. Whoever fails one of these saves is from then on totally indifferent as to whether he wants to leave or not and if they fail a second save they will even actively prevent being taken away from the place.<br />
While any guests are still unable to create any sounds other than by talking, the fae are able to produce all sounds they want, including music. In fact it seems that everything originating from the realm isn't hindered by the silence in any way.<br />
Many of the rooms in the palace have large windows, which seem to go lead out of the castle, but in fact none of them offers a way to escape. First of all, an excessive amount of strenght is needed to break one, as they seem as strong as massive wooden doors. The fae will politely ask any guests not to break the windows but wont physically stop them from doing so. After a few minutes they will forget that any window was ever broken. They will in fact ignore that one is damaged, except when explicitely told so and then act rather surprised. <br />
Second, whoever actually jumps out of these windows will find out that they are one-way portals leading to a small, broken window about twenty feet above the floor of the courtyard with the divining pond (see below).</p>

<p>This is a place my players may soon discover in one of their campaings. In fact I used to play a warlock with both fey and fiend blood whose bloodline originated from this place, but due to the DM leaving the round I was forced to master it, so this character will have to go.</p>       </div>

         <p>I like the atmosphere you build up; the path through the forest is a perfect beginning for the realm beyond.</p>

<p>I also like the idea of the entire kingdom being trapped in a "loop". This is something that easily leads most players to serious investigations.</p>

<p>But there exactly is what I miss about the post: What do I do with players who deny following the routine? Some might not even follow the herald to the throne room, others will try to break out of the routine at some later point.</p>

<p>To use this place, one needs a bit more "flesh" to handle any action the players make to break out of the routine. What you offer is a riddle, but you offer no way, not even a hint, to solve the riddle. Of course, there's the hidden portals, but they don't help *solving* the riddle, only *escaping* it.</p>

<p>Another practical problem of this site is: When I master an adventure, I have to make sure it stays exciting for the players. The eternal routine of this place may be fascinating at first, but a DM needs some instrument to keep things exciting after the players have seen the routine the first two or three times...</p>

<p>So much for criticism; nevertheless I like the site very much. It just needs some more "flesh" to be ready for use in a real adventure <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/smile.png" title="Smiling" alt="Smiling" class="smiley-content"/></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>As to players breaking out of the routine: I wrote that the fey will just politely ignore anything the players do. If they want to walk away, fine. No one will hinder them. I guess it would be necessary to flesh out the palace some more, add interesting rooms which can keep the players busy. This places is on the evil side of the great wheel, inhabited by demonic fey, so I guess there should be some evil here. Any suggestions for rooms would be very welcome. I'm currently stating out the curse on the silent king and how it can be broken. This is what should keep the players busy in the kingdom.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>One option would be to give the players two or three false lines of hints, and one "real" one. For example:</p>

<p>They find a room with a one-way portal coming from Pandemonium. There are creatures in that room that came from the plane of madness, whch could turn into a small adventure all by itself. But while at first it seems this is related to the king's sleep, it might instead be related to some background story of the herald. But still, by solving that side-plot, they might shake up the herald a bit, and possibly get an ally in the attempt to break the curse.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Ok, my first ideas for rooms (with a somewhat obvious hidden portal)<br />
The Tower of Aeolus' Harp<br />
This wooden tower rises high above the surrounding buildings of the castle, tall and slender. Inside, a spiral staircase winds up to the top floor, leaving a hole in the central in which several arm-thick strings reach from top to bottom of the tower. The top floor of the tower is open to all sides, the roof just held up by four thin pillars. <br />
On windy days the whole tower acts as a resonating body, increasing the sounds of the strings when the wind moves them, creating deep, hollow sounds, accompanied by the high shrieking of the wind. <br />
Whenever the music plays, the top floor of the tower acts as a portal to Pandemonium, allowing access by stepping over the edge in the same direction as the wind goes. <br />
The tower has in fact one inhabitant: Revior Sikarids, a total barmy who came here from Pandemonium by stumbling inside the portal. He normally sits inside a corner on the ground floor of the tower, hands over his head, trying to shut his ears from the noise. Even though the winds drove him mand, he refuses to both leave the tower and to talk to anyone as long as the music plays. When the music stops, he leaves the tower and wanders the empty hallways of the castle in search of food and water, carefully hiding himself from any of the other inhabitants.<br />
When encountered he will try to flee to the tower, but if cornered he will instead start rambling incohorently about "The seven Books of Forbidden Dreams", the artefacts he was sent to retrieve on Pandemonium.</p>

<p>So, there you have it. Portal to Pandemonium, false hint.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>I really like the tower description. One question comes up, though: Why was the tower built? If the players start investigating, they should be able to find out at least a spark of background information from the point of view of the locals <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/smile.png" title="Smiling" alt="Smiling" class="smiley-content"/></p>

          The Forest of Silence        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Always those difficult questions... What if the King just liked some music? He's a fey, they are a little strange.<br />
As requested: <br />
How to deal with the players:<br />
Both the herald and the inhabitants of the castle are at all times very polite to the players, to the point of being annoying, yet they don't seem willing or able to answer any questions about the castle or it's history more complicated than "What's the name of this room?", "What's it's purpose?" or "How do I get there?". They will outright ignore anyone who mentions a curse on the king or asks about portals. <br />
The players are free to explore the castle at will and enter any rooms they find interesting. Twice a day there is a big meal in the great dining hall, where foods and drinks seem to magically appear in large quantities before the meal, at least the players won't ever see any servants. The guests are polite, able to talk about a broad variety of subjects, ranging from interplanar politics and history to breeding and hunting animals or the nature of magic or belief. Some of them are excellent musicians and some of them will perform after every meal until the inhabitans go to bed.</p>

<p>Quick ideas for a few more rooms:<br />
The black tree: <br />
Deep under the castle, after many winding staircases and dark tunnels the curious explorer finds himself in a narrow chamber of raw stone, lit by countless tiny glowing crystals on the walls. In the centre of the chamber stands a black, twisted and leafless tree, seemingly burnt by a very hot fire. Apart from this tree, the room is totally empty.</p>

<p>The Divining Pond<br />
A small door leads out of the throne room to a small yard with four mighty ash trees, one in every corner and a small pond in the middle. Anyone staring inside the water for more than one round has the impression that blurry images rise up from it's dephts, depicting the former realm of the hag countess in Baator. (Although this will most likely not be obvious to anyone who hasn't been there or possesses a vast knowledge of the lower planes) <br />
Any caster who casts a scrying spell on the pond will notice that the spell will work regardless of the plane the target subject is on and as if he were one step more familiar to the target.<br />
About twenty feet over the ground is a small, broken glass-window, the one which is the recieving end of the portals in all the other windows. <br />
Any character who climbs up to and through that window will find himself in a dark library with no other entrance. The wooden shelves are filled with countless books about magic, and the fae. Anyone spending some time searching will come across spells of first or second level described in the books, ready to be copied into any spellbook, as well as short text fragments about the realm itself, hinting that these fae could have a connection to fiends of some kind, but nothing definite.</p>

<p>So, I just noticed the following: I don't have the slightest idea who might have caused this curse or how it might be healed. Any ideas?</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Firstly, let me say that I love the idea. I'm particularly fond of the fae, and of the three planes directly involved with them (Arborea, Pandemonium, and the Outlands), the Outlands definitely has the most of that mysterious magical atmosphere. This idea fits in perfectly.</p>

<p>As for who is responsible for the King (or at least his fiendish side) and his curse, I'm very tempted to say Malagard (The Hag Countess and former Lord of the Sixth in Baator). Granted, I'm a bit obsessed with her lately, particularly with the project I'm working on, but there are reasons. On a purely physical level, both she and the King have the black feathered wings, but that means little. Malagard is a night hag, albeit an unusually powerful one. The hags, particularly the outsider ones, have always had some obscure connection to the fae. Perhaps the partial and perhaps temporary reintegration of this closed off repeating timezone, maybe even demiplane, into the main timestream of the rest of the multiverse could be due to Malagard's apparent death. Still, if she is involved, how dead is she and how long will the curse last? </p>

<p>Much like a lot of other planar sites, it is the mystery of the place that makes it so attractive, but the possibilities are still fun to consider.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I like. Interesting idea, very mysterious. I like mysterious, strange places.</p>

<p>If they are half-fiendish fae, but unfailingly polite, and nobody wants to leave, maybe there shouldn't be anything outright/obviously evil in the castle, but some rooms could have really creepy stuff going on (meaning, even creepier than the constant silence and the vacant inhabitants). However, the longer you are there and the less you are willing to leave, the less you notice or realize that any of the rooms are creepy. The fae, of course, would not notice at all.</p>

<p>Also, will the characters discover other planewalkers who stumbled upon this place and are now trapped, never wanting to leave (besides the one barmy guy) or are all the guests at the feast fae? Perhaps planewalkers who've been trapped for a <span style="font-style:italic">really</span> long time not only want to stay forever, but become trapped in the routine and convinced the king is going to wake up any minute now.</p>

<p>One last question: is there anything within the forest, other than the enchantment and the question of the silence, to draw them deeper?</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Iavas: Interesting idea. I never really knew much about the Hag Countess, other than she existed until I heard that she exploded and don't know much more now. To keep things mysterious I oculd not really mention that she is the mother but give some hints, there could also be a portal to Baator. The question then is what the picture in the pond could be (I don't want a picture of the countess' corpse or the layer, much to obvious) and how that curse could be broken, it sounds rather difficult.<br />
Vaevictis: Guests: I see four possibilities there: First, all the guests are, and have always been, fey. Second, there are other guests, either still searching for the exit or part of the whole thing. Third: the guests themselves could be transformed into the same kind of fey after a certain time. Half-transformed guests would certainly scare the players and put some pressure on them. Fourth: There were other guests, but they disappeared. Killed by the fae, vanished through portals, something else, who knows?<br />
As to the forest: well, for starters, there is the fact that it's not easy to get out of the forest, meaning that most people will end up near the pond someday. Also, most players are and will always be curious. <br />
My players have a reason which is a bit more specific: Half a tribe of Khaasta is hunting them. The Khaasta don't follow them inside but will fire at them whenever they get withhin range of the edge of the forest.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I was wondering whether the guests would turn into fae.</p>

<p>Another question: is it impossible to make noise, other than speaking, in the castle? If so, how do the fae make music? Are they only singing, or do they have instruments from which they alone can draw sound?</p>

<p>The windows in the throne room got me thinking:</p>

<p>Are the windows unbreakable? If they are not, here's an idea: (you can take it or leave it)</p>

<p>If any character asks about escaping the castle through the windows (those in the throne room, or in any other room with widows) the fae ignore the question. If a character actually tries to break one, the fae politely ask him/her to stop, or gently try to stop him, but they will never use any real force.<br />
The windows (if they can be broken) can only be broken by an excessive amount of force. However, they do not allow escape into the Forest. Although the throne room windows appear to look out at the Silent Forest, they are actually one-way portals to the courtyard. Anyone who jumps through one find himself stepping (or jumping) out of one of the doorways lining the courtyard. These doors can also be used to enter or exit the courtyard normally, since all of them simply open from rooms in the castle.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Nice idea and definitely "Planescapy". One of the classical "weird haunted mansion" ones. I'll add that to the section about the throne room.<br />
Hmm. That with the music is actually an excellent question. I'll change that a little: The guests can not create any sounds, while the Fae seem to be able to normally emit sounds if they want to. That's gonna bug the players.</p>

<p>Edit:<br />
I changed both the first post about the fae and the windows and the description of the backyard with the pond, adding a description the portal and a room it leads to, the library.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>OK, here's another question to consider -- what will you do if a character attacks one of the fae? or even *gasp!* attacks the King? Or tries to blast holes in walls, or tunnel through them, or cast spells that dissolve them or turn them to mud? How will the fae react?</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I'm a tad confused, why would the pond show anything about the Hag Countess?</p>

<p>The entire encounter seems so serene that it equates more with the fae aspect. It is only the crumbling curse, and perhaps the king's heritage, that is probably influnced by Malagard.</p>

         <p>Didn't have the time to read everything, but roughly scanning the other posts, I'm amazed about the cool ideas people post here. I just love you people <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/smile.png" title="Smiling" alt="Smiling" class="smiley-content"/></p>

<p>The talk about the Hag Countess gave me an idea... what if she uses the king's body to reform herself? That is, the king isn't really "cursed", but rather has fallen into a deep slumber because the Hag Countess herself is growing inside him. The Curse will end the moment the Hag Countess has reformed. Of course, that will mean the king's death.</p>

<p>The "coming of the Countess" could lead to strange magical effects in the palace, for example, the existing portals could slowly change, so that more and more of them lead to Baator. Or the walls could turn black, and strange mystical signs appears on them. Or...</p>

<p>With that background, and considering the other fey are under the Countess' influence, trying to kill the king could result in the entire residents trying to lynch the adventurers. On the other hand, killing the king might be the only (or at least the only obvious) way to keep the Hag from returning, and if they don't kill him now, he'll die anyway when she returns.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Joyblood: While I am thankful for all and any ideas about the curse and the realm, I think that I have to object here. While I like the idea of a connection between the King and the Hag Countess, I wanted the players to find a way to save him, because it will in fact be important to my plot. Also, the Hag Countess returning would be an event so epic that I think the entire campaign should revolve around him. You are of course free to change this locality according to your wishes and do this, but I have a certain vision how it would fit into my campaign and your idea is just a tad to big.</p>

<p>Iavas: I wanted the pond to show an image related to the curse and since up to now the only thing we have about the curse is that it could be related to the Hag Queens demise, so I wanted to show a picture of that.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Sure, I appreciate that, I just belong to the "Just because it's on the planes it doesn't have to be epic"-faction of DMs. Well, I'm also a little strange, I have roleplaying only detective campaigns on level 17 and stuff like your idea about the Hag Countess on level 3. This place should be at least a little "cut off" from the grand schemes and politics of the verse, if you know what I mean. And there should be a possiblity to wake up the king.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I know I haven't written anything in here in ages, but sometimes I just get those creative surges... anyway. More rooms. And still not many ideas for a curse.</p>

<p>The Hall of Trophies<br />
This is a vast hall, dozens of yards across in all directions. All over it are small pedestals of black marble, and on each one a small velvet cushion. On every cushion lies the eye of a different creature. The eyes are in such a perfect shape that they seem to be made from glass or gemstones, but careful examination shows even the place were the nerves were severed on the back. The eyes range in size from a few milimeters to larger than a head, from those of pixies and eladrin to those of dragons and giants. And they have all one more property: If one touches them he has a short and very vivid illusion of the last thing the creature the eye belonged to saw: The Silent King, clad from foot to toe in silver armour, holding a spear of white wood and mithril of well over fifteen feet, standing over his victim, ready to strike.</p>

<p>The Maze of Mirrors<br />
From the outside this seems to be a small and empty room, with a faded green carpet and walls of bare stone. But whoever enters it finds himself in a labyrinth, with all walls made from high mirror. One might wander around for hours in there and it seems some wandered around longer, as one might see the reflection of mumified corpses (but never the corpses themselves). To leave the mirror one has to either succeed on an intelligence check DC 20, which can be repeated every ten minutes or close his eyes. If one has his eyes closed, the mirrors vanish leaving only the empty room seen from outside, until he reopens them, at which point they reappear. They are not an illusion and therefore a will save cannot help, but a true seeing spell can. If a creature is inside the room while someone from the outside watches, he will see them wander around with a dreamily look on their face, evading invisible obstacles.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Well, feel free to suggest a better name <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/wink.png" title="Eye-wink" alt="Eye-wink" class="smiley-content"/><br />
And here's the first real clue:</p>

<p>Deep, deep below the castle lies the royal dungeon. It is neither big nor easy to find, consisting only of one well-hidden room. To find it's door, one has to climb down a narrow stairway, in a far-off corner of the castle, which leads to a small storeroom with empty crates and barrels. One of it's walls, apparently made from heavy blocks of grey stone and covered in dust and spiderwebs, is in fact illusionary, hiding a narrow door.<br />
The room behind is hidden in three different wards: first, to enter the room one has to make a will save DC 20 or turn round, walk back up the stairs and forget that he was ever down there.<br />
The second ward consists of a two large circles around the room, one drawn with blood on the floor, the other with runes engraved in the floor and coated in cold iron. They act as permanent circles of protection against evil and chaos, facing both inwards and outwards.<br />
The ward is in the middle of the room: A large chest, formed like a large coffin. It is made from rowan wood and studded with heavy silver, lead and cold iron bars. (Magically enhanced and studded wood, break DC 25, 50 HP, Hardness 15). It's special construction stops all spells from going through, including any kind of interdimensional movement or teleportation.<br />
Inside the chest is the castles only prisoner: a small girl. She looks like a human girl of about ten years, with snow-white skin  and hair and white, feathered wings on her back. This is the kings only child, called, in the language of the fey, the princess of snow and moonlight.<br />
The Princess is deep asleep, like the king, but not from the curse, like the king, but from a spell cast on the chest, which puts all prisoner into magical sleep. Since the magical box protected her against the curse when it was cast, she wakes up soon after being freed from the box.</p>

         <p>I love it! It's so darn creepy! It actually made it harder to sleep yesterday evening after reading this! I'm definitely stealing it at some point!</p>

<p>I went to think, maybe the curse should have a link with the dual nature of the king, half fiend half fey. Could he be the unlawful son of the king (well, royal consort) Oberon of the faeries, and neither Malagard or him could accept him in their courts as long as he was tainted by the opposite alignement (chaotic good versus lawful evil), so they put him to sleep to prevent each other of trying and pull him in his direction? Then the way to awake him would be to find a way of getting him rid of his dual nature.</p>

<p>If Oberon was the second parent of the Silent King, maybe there should be a place making reference to him in the castle as well. For example, the sky above the pond could be featuring the stars not of the Outlands, but Arborea. So good astrologers/astronoms only could notice. And maybe some feature related to Oberon in the sky could be more prominent. (I vaguely remember long ago reading a faery tale about a star presiding to the birth of Oberon, maybe this star could be brighter than normal..) Divination spell would be improved when cast at the sky like when cast through the pound.. or astrology skills would be improved.</p>

<p>I was also thinking, what happens when you attack one of the feys? do they suddenly show their dark face, enjoying the kill and the cruelty, and then returning to the party as if nothing ever happened? or even creepier, do they not react at all, letting themselves being cut open without even a blink? And maybe the adventurers would find the bodies of the dead the next day, lying on some kind of altars or coffins in a large room, containing several more empty ones (or maybe simply in their own beds). The body could look fresh and unharmed, and heal over time any new wound caused to them, yet not breathe, and having no heartbeat...</p>

<p>What about killing the herald? should he be replaced the next day by another of the fey guests, none of them being aware that this has not always been this particular to be the herald? And if all the feys are killed, then they find the barmy of the lyra tower as herald the next day, acting perfectly sane, and like he's always been the herald. This would suggest that there's got <span style="text-decoration:underline">always</span> to be a herald, and that if they came to kill this one, maybe one of them would awake being the herald the next day...</p>

<p>I don't have idea about killing the king.. Maybe some kind of evil catasrophy would occur, like the castel falling appart around the laughs and screams of the dying (awaken and demented) king. Then the heros waking up as from a nightmare in a perfectly intact castel, with a perfectly asleep king?</p>

<p>I have also interogations: what alignement do you read off the feys and the king? what if you read their minds? and what if you fly off (or jump off) the tower or the courtyard?</p>

<p>I don't like so much the trophy room. It's too gory to me for this atmosphere. And seeing the king awake gives off a lot of infos at once, including the diverse settings in which the kills took place, that can be seen in the backround of the stored memories, as well as his facial expression when he kills, which says a lot about someone...</p>

<p>Still I think this is all very neat! hope you'll finish it one day before I get an occasion of using it!</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Regarding the Herald: Yes, I think killing him would cause one of the other fey to take up his regalia sometime later and just act as if he had always been the herald. Adds more to the athmosphere. The heroes just <span style="font-style:italic">can't change a damn thing about this place</span>.<br />
Now, killing the fey is a different question.<br />
I see several approaches:<br />
The corpses vanish. (Too cheap)<br />
As soon as no one is watching the corpse, it vanishes. The next day, there is a new fey, taking the place of the dead one. And since they all look vers similar, it would be hard to tell the difference. (I like that one better, gives a lot of athmosphere, since the players don't know anything.)<br />
They just die. Without even reacting to the wound, they just collapse.</p>

<p>As for the trophy room: It's not gory. It's like a collection of jewels, beautifully arranged. Sure, it reflects the more evil aspects of these fey, but it's done in such a damn <span style="font-style:italic">artistic</span> fashion...<br />
Also, there has to be a place were the players can get some information. Now, since you mentioned his face, that's a more difficult question. His expression... cruel, evil and twisted? Completely focused and emotionless? <br />
Maybe a little detached, with an almost sad look?  Changing with different illusions?</p>

<p>As for Oberon... interesting. The Lawful Evil Hag Queen and the Chaotic Good Fey King. That's a nice pair, these two. And would result in quite strong offspring, I imagine. (Also, a nice idea for those over at the Grey Waste project who wondered about the offspring of hags)</p>

<p>About Killing the King: I think that should be outright impossible. Perhaps, no weapon can wound him. Or, any weapon just passes through his body, leaving no wound when drawn out. Or they shatter. I don't really know.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">
