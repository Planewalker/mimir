         <p>Duckluck,</p>

<p>Thanks for reviewing the character sheet -I sent another pm relative to my character's survivability, as well as in regards to the Karach.</p>

<p>Other than those final tinkering, we're (linji) is set.</p>

<p>And not to step on anyone's toes (especially Duckluck's), while reviewing some of the character sheets, I found some errors/discrepancies.  I am not exactly sure in what format/medium to express these (I don't want to be subverting the DM's role) and neither do I wish to have other players think I am being critical (I'm really just trying to help).  </p>

<p>So, I think I'll sit on those for a while -see if they get fixed without my intervention, and see if anyone replies to this matter.</p>

<p>Perro, </p>

<p>To echo and add to Duckluck's comment -the point buy system is found on page 169 of the Dungeon Master's Guide (bottom left of the page).  Duckluck's explanation is very well said too.</p>

<p>This was actually my first time using 3EProfiler -I found the system to be surprisingly user friendly (not perfect, but more than sufficient.</p>

<p>JaggedOldRed,</p>

<p>Well, I would not have mind playing with a Paladin, but the absence of such strong moral/ethical absolutism will probabaly help the internal actions and external plans of our eclectic group.</p>

<p>Also, it will be great to have another quick PC (Kadar and Linji already being fairly good at sneaking and scouting).  Likewise, it will be absolutely stupendous to have someone able to handle Traps (hurray!) as well as divine magic (through UMD, little hurray!).  I really like the Spellthief class, and so I am excited to hear what you come up with.  Any ideas so far on race and "alignment".</p>

<p>(which brings me to a question for Duckluck -how does your alignment houserule affect spells like detect alignment and alignment based spells? -is it merely calling it "discern planar affinity/aura" and keeping the mechanics the same?)</p>

<p>Oberoni_Fallacy,</p>

<p>I absolutely agree with your choice to switch.  The "pure" arcane route is much more what we need (as we kinda have several "social" characters -Kadar and Linji both have +5 Diplomacy, very good Sense Motive (Kadar +7, Linji +9), and now we have JOR's spelltheif to help with traps, and supplement magic -a lot of it, I'd imagine to be illusion/beguiler redundant (I could be wrong though as he has not done/posted his build).</p>

<p>I really am excited to play with a Wu Jen. Their distinct flavor will make it more interesting than playing with just a "straight" wizard/sorcerer.  </p>

<p>Also, for playing the "pure battlemage" (me blow up!) -this works well with the group as well for our arcane needs -three of the characters (Kadar, Linji, and the spelltheif already have decent "sneak/scout" abilities and so that kind of supplemental magic is not as critical).  </p>

<p>But the mass "fireball" spells are: they affect mass foes, as well as most are ranged (hello ranged specialist).</p>

<p>(Although, I really really like the flavor/fluff for Wu Jen -have you considered playing a Warmage?  They are probably the best for a straight "battlemage-destructo").  </p>

<p>Have you decided upon a race/"alignment" for the Wu Jen? (and are you trying to keep the "Eastern" feel?)</p>

<p>Azriael,</p>

<p>I'm glad you liked Linji.  As for taking Sacred Fist/mixing divine casting -yes, I was/am actually considering such (won't make definate plans till seeing how the campaign takes us and him -since that is how/why/when Linji would choose the path as well).  In a way -he wouldn't differentiate the two paths as seperate at all.</p>

<p>Glad to hear our thoughts/ideas are in line (we must both be listening to the Cadence, eh?).</p>

<p>As for your character bio -it is great!  I really love all the details you put into it (not just the physical, mental, and emotional spheres, but also showing how each has developed in the past and the present with the presage to the future).  Really well done.</p>

<p>I'll post my bio in a little bit (probably tonight) and so I may mention Kadar -if anything I say you don't agree with, let me know and I'll adjust/eliminate it (I was thinking they met in Sigil, btw).</p>

<p>Ok, have to say, I love the group we are assembling (has anyone heard from Perro lately?).</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Perro PM'd me thursday night, remember? Oh, and I'm sure there are problems with the character sheets. I've been busy (with this mostly:)), and I haven't gotten a chance to thoroughly vet everything. I ask that any player who notices discrepencies, this means you Dialexis, post the problems so that I or the player in question can fix it. </p>

<p>Also, a reply to your PM has been sent. I hope it doesn't crush your dreams too badly.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Duckluck,</p>

<p>"Perro PM'd me thursday night, remember?"</p>

<p>Well you said you had three pms and then your reply was to four people, so I was not sure (but am glad to hear it now).</p>

<p>The reason I was asking was not only relative to whether Perro was still going to play, but more specifically, I was wondering if he was still thinking of doing "healing" through Incarnum.</p>

<p>I am curious since I am considering with Linji later doing the Sacred Fist route, but if healing is covered I might not.  So, Perro, would you find collaborating with me? -pm, email, or post is fine.</p>

<p>Duckluck, I'll post any errors I think I see -but I'll recheck again since some may have been caught in the interum since I last checked them.</p>

<p>And thanks for the pm (dreams remain uncrushed).  I replied with sending another pm, and hopefully all the kinks are worked out.</p>

<p>JOR &amp; Oberoni,</p>

<p>How are things going on your end? (no rush, just excited)</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

Sorry for the slow progress so far. With so many choices provided for the campoaign it took me a while to find an adequate focus...<br />
I am glad to say that i have finally come up with a character concept which everyone will like...<br />
I'll start with a Nathry (also probably lightning genasi)  spellthief which will go on to assassin on the next level... Nathri intrigue me, living isolated deep within the ethereal, and I want to portray its first reactions upon first coming to the big city to discharge a special quest imposed by his tribe's seer...also expecting the big city to take him for granted, underestimating the little guys capabilities, until they learn that Marek is a "dangerous little runt"...expect a fully fleshed bio and sheet by Monday morning...<br />

         <p>Remember, that the spellthief spell progression doesn't stack with the assasin progression, so you'd basically be starting over. If you switch next level, that doesn't matter much, just don't go back to Spellthief afterwards. Also, spell stealing, the key abillity of the spell thief won't get better once you switch, so you might actually want to just play a rogue. This is relatively minor though, so don't worry about what I have to say.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Yes, I am definately happy (not only with the resolution, but also that we reached a resolution).  I definately don't mind you reposting the "expo" here on the thread, but perhaps it might be best to wait until after I post Linji's background (so it will stand in context, make more sense to the others).  I'll be posting it somewhere around midnight your time (maybe a little before).  And yes, that little teaser made me uber-excited to start the campaign -excellent work!</p>

<p>JaggedOldRed,</p>

<p>Well, of course, I don't know the exact details, but your character seems not only very interesting, but also seems to portend a plethora of complimentary facets between the other PCs.  I look forward to seeing how it all comes out.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I am fully aware that a plain rogue or even a bard might be mechanically better suited for the character, but spellthief adds some flavour and decent abilities at the cost of dodge, +1d6 on sneack and 2 skills per level (when compared to the rogue...) but I think it would still be fun to play, since I am staying with assassin after 6th...besides even a scorching ray stollen from a mage of high enough level can pack quite a bit of punch, not to mention the look on the tanar'ri when I steal his fire resistance just before our Wu Jen gets him into his sights...</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>JOR,</p>

<p>I was wondering, have you considered making Marek a ninja?  I don't mean the Oriental flavor, but the class abilities have great "rogue" abilities with "neat" abilities, all of which seem to meld seemlessly with Nathri culture and planar origins.  Instead of Assassin, you could PrC as Ghost Faced Killer, and thus gain a "death" attack that is Will based instead of Fort and not have to study for three rounds and eventually gain multiple uses of the "fightful death attack".  Sure, both have trade-offs, but the flavor and crunch abilities of a flvor would make great Nathri tie-ins (as they really might have been the primodeal developers of these traditions and such).</p>

<p>I love spellthiefs as well -but Ducklucks comments do make a lot of sense.</p>

<p>Regardless of ninja, rogue, or spellthief, I am sure Marek will be great.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

Thanks for the tips. I just checked the ninja-ghost killer combo...it is compelling, but would mean that I actually get the PRC at 7th level and only the killing attack at 11th...also I think that the 3round wit for the assassin attack has a very nice feel of hunting to it that can make good use of the slower, more deliberate pace of board play...<br />
Lets see how it turn out...<br />

I just checked the ninja-ghost killer combo...it is compelling, but would mean that I actually get the PRC at 7th level and only the killing attack at 11th...also I think that the 3round wit for the assassin attack has a very nice feel of hunting to it that can make good use of the slower, more deliberate pace of board play...<br />
Lets see how it turn out...<br />

         <p>Hey guys. Sorry I haven't been around too much.</p>

<p>I'll have much more time now. If you want to know what was occupying my time, it was <a href="http://boards1.wizards.com/showthread.php?t=710555&amp;page=7" class="bb-url">This. Vote for Han Solo!</a></p>

<p>Seriously. If you have a boards1.wizards.com account, vote for the best-optimized build. I would hope that would be me (hey, if I win, I get free stuff) - but the more votes, the better. If you don't have one, register. If you play D+D, it's one of the sites you have to have an account on.</p>

<p><span style="font-size:7px">Vote for Han Solo.</p>

<p><span style="color:blue">Han Solo.</span></p>

<p><span style="color:green">Han Solo.</span></p>

<p><span style="color:brown">Han Solo.</span></p>

<p>This is not subliminal messaging.<br />
</span></p>

<p>I have much more time to work on my character for this now. It should be up tomorrow. I'm still up for suggestions, though - but I want something that can do damage.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

Oberoni Fallacy,</p>

I really can't see why. Second Edition was even more simple to break, especially if you allowed Skills and Powers or Kits. It also 'balanced' things by putting all the power into the hands of the DM, allowing players to... sit back and see what they rolled up. Seriously. 3d6 no rerolls, Class limitations by race, and the archaic multiclassing system... they just make me shudder.</p>

<p>The entire purpose of the CO board is to prove the full extent of the rules so that you can actually adjucate a game. If you don't know how the rules are broken, you can't really understand the rules - in my opinion, at least.</p>

<p>While I would likely never *play*, say, Han, it's important to know what he does and how he does it so I can reference it in the future. If I don't know what the rules are, I shouldn't make House Rules, either.</p>

<p>(Interesting Tangent - this exact theory is what my name references. The "Oberoni Fallacy" is the belief that since a DM can ad-hoc balance something or create rules on the fly, a system is not in need of adjustment. The entire purpose of a rules system is that the DM should *not* have to balance things on the fly.)<div class="bb-quote">Quote:<blockquote class="bb-quote-body"></p></blockquote></div> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I guess I should've elaborated. I don't dislike 3rd edtion and PrCs because of them being broken. I don't oppose "breaking" the system, or powergaming even per se(it's alot of why I like D&amp;D). Rather, I dislike them because it's highly redundant. How is a Dragon Disciple a "class?" Do Rogue and Assassin really need to be different? How come any character can take levels of Sorcerer(inherent magical prowess in the blood) later in their life? WHY is Bard a spontaneous caster?!(in 2nd edition they weren't, they studied it as they should). Basically, I look at the list of classes and different levels that character has, or the "build" that people are going to play when they get their hands on Neverwinter Nights 2, and all I see is a jumble of needless, more-than-one-word, redundant classes, all jumbled together for a few select abilties.</p>

<p>I admit that 2nd edition needs to be house ruled pretty extensively to work. My personal belief is any race should be able to be any class, and any race can multiclass or dual class, Dual Classing shouldn't have attribute requirements. I also feel kits are a huge step up from prestige classes(they give and take some of what the base class has rather than becoming a whole new class when it isn't warranted). Understandably, being a Rogue and becoming an Assassin later isn't a detachment, at least in the way that Sneak Attack stacks between your time as the two classes but I find the system redundant.</p>

<p>I feel 3rd edition tries to turn classes into something other than classes, it tries to sort of turn them into "ability sets" which are taken in levels, which all coagulate into your character's abilities. This isn't an entirely bad idea, but why not just let us handpick skills? There's no reason to play a middle ground here, let us pick a class or let us pick our abilities.</p>

<p>I also like the Attributes handling in 2nd edition better, odd numbers weren't ALWAYS worthless, and it made higher numbers more easily equatable into Roleplay terms. In 2nd and 3rd edition, a creature with human-like intelligence has at least 3 Int: but a creature with 19 Int in 2nd edition and a creature with 22 Int in 3rd are roughly equal? The math got thrown out of whack by the gaining of attributes through levels. Also, bonuses and penalties were generally less common in 2nd edition, (though it did leave a larger than necessary dead space, I'd probably house rule a tighter "middle ground") which seems to me to be more believable in roleplay terms: you aren't going to lose a significant amount of hit if you drop 2 Str(unless you're already at deity levels), 18/50 Str is only +2 to THAC0, it's +4 to hit in 3rd edition.</p>

<p>I also don't like how the relationship between Maximum Dexterity Bonus on armor and AC from armor is UTTERLY LINEAR. A person with 18 Dexterity gets just as much protection from Studded Leather as from Half-Plate? This makes sense how? I fully agree that 2nd edition's AC system isn't exactly brilliant, and needs definite improvement, but in my opinion, when they were going to add Maximum Dexterity bonuses to armor in 3rd edition(and thus, finally have a shot at differentiating dodging from getting hit too weakly to receive damage) they should've made Armor either give a generally higher AC, but lower speed, or give some AC, and damage reduction, rather than pure AC. Either/or, just SOMETHING DIFFERENT. Nope, Dexterity AC and Armor AC are still the same beast.</p>

<p>Lastly, this is more of a nitpick, but I think THAC0 and old style Saving Throws are easier than to-hit bonuses and whatnot. Why? The stat is the number you need to roll! To-hit and new AC/Saves are way more relativistic. But again, this is more of a pet peeve than a real problem.</p>

<p>In the end, BOTH systems have their problems for sure, and they both need a fair amount of house ruling, but outside of the skills system(and possibly the feats system), I feel 2nd edition was closer to working optimally.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>What? I never really played much 2nd edition, and what I did play I was too young to appreciate, aside from a vague memory that THAC0 was a pain in the ass, the AC's were backwards for some reason, and my brother's 19 strength was crazy good. Therefore, my knowlege of second edition rules is mostly limited to Baldur's Gate. That said, I can say with some certainty that the rule you speak of no longer exists. </p>

<p>The Third Edition rules treat magic items in an almost painfully generic manner, so a +1 bastard sword from Chult is exactly the same as a +1 Bastard sword from Tyr, at least as long as no special materials were used.</p>

<p>Korchuk, I know a lot of people really liked 2E, but third is definitely an improvement. The simple fact that all your "must-have" house rules are things they added into 3E demonstrates as much. One complaint I've heard over and over is that 3E seperates the mechanics from the flavor, and this is totally true (just look at what I said last paragraph), but I'm not sure that's really a bad thing. If every page of the rulebook were nothing but crunchy mechanical details, it would be a more boring read, but it would also be a shorter one, and it wouldn't stop me from making an intersting and enjoyable game. If I need help building a setting, I'll buy a published setting. I think a page of description per class is plenty, just as long as the class itself is good.</p>

<p>If anything, I think WotC has finally picked up the ball that TSR dropped. As their recent reinvention of Minis as a full-fledged table-top game demonstrates, they have backed off from elaborate meta-plots and books full of fluff (sadly, PS was one of them) and have finally turned back to the much avoided task of making the actual mechanics of the game be fun and functional. They haven't really succeeded yet, but they are certainly on the right course Let's face it, 2E rules aren't bad when you get used to them and the DM knows how to keep them under control, but they are almost painfully complicated, and hold no common rules throughout. Everything you do must be learned individually. It's not that hard to play, but I'd never want to have to DM it.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I hear you entirely, and I don't hate 3rd edition in the least. But there's a reason I didn't type that whole blob from the start: my MAIN problem with 3rd edition is the advent of the gigantic, needless sea of redundant base classes and prestige classes and races that've been added, both through the main SRD and supplemental books.</p>

<p>I'm the kind of person who likes condensed things. I'd be happy if D&amp;D had Fighter, Mage, Rogue, Cleric, and multiclasses thereof. All the abilities of the other base classes could probably be converted to feats(Barbarian Rage/Bardic Music anyone? Improved Unarmed Strike and Stunning Fist are already there!)</p>

<p>That's all I'm really saying, other than that fix Armor, and make the feats required for dual wielding less ridiculous, and I'll tell you that 2nd edition is Archaic  <img src="http://planewalker.com/sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/lol.png" title="Laughing out loud" alt="Laughing out loud" class="smiley-content"/></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>There's nothing wrong with the way armor works. If you are a master acrobat, with reflexes that make the average cat look clumsy by comparison,  you don't want to walk around in a veritable tin can. You want to take full advantage of your agillity. That means light, unrestrictive armor. If you have the 28 dex necessary to make Padded leather be as good as full plate, I think you've earned it. Although you should note, that the system usually doensn't work that way. If you add the armor bonus from Full Plate to its max dex you get 9 Padded armor is the only other armor that has those two combine to reach that high. Most of the time, every other time, the max dex plus AC will equal 8 or less. </p>

<p>I'm not even sure why you think this is a problem. Sure there is a destinct advantage to wearing lighter armor, if you have enough dexterity (lack of armor check penalties and the like), but that's hardly relevant. Characters with really high Dexterities will almost always be in classes that don't wear heavy armor anyway. </p>

<p>Also, in case you didn't realize, the entire process of character creation could be simplified into Abillities, Skills, and Feats fairly easily, and other game systems do this, but D&amp;D uses classes, and probably always will use some variation on classes. This is partly because, D&amp;D is a very, very complex system, and it would be an ordeal worthy of Heracles to convert that complexity into an open system without altering the core of the game, and partly because classes are cool. Without classes, characters would all wind up either making optimized abominations, ("I'm a woodsman, so I'm going to give myself good Strength and Dexterity, max out hide, move silently, and spot, and only take the very best archery feats"), or simply recreating existing classes ("I'm a woodsman, so I'm going to give myself various thematic skills and abilities, then I'm going to use my feats to give myself some random abilities, an animal companion, and maybe divine magic, in adition to my combat feats.") The whole system would get old quickly.</p>

<p>Have they gone overboard with Prestige Classes? Yes, and no. Many PrC's are badly written, and more than a few of them trample on other class' flavor, but there is certainly something to be said for variety with limits. Honestly, I don't see a problem with the current system, so much as a potential for a happier medium in the future.</p>

<p>Dual Weilding is a major pain, but then dual-weilding in real life is less than convenient. How many pictures have you seen of Conan the barbarian with a claymore in each hand? How many Romans two-fisted their gladii? Hell, how many samurai actually faught with both pieces of the daisho at the same time? Not many, not many at all. There's a reason for that. It takes great training and skill to be able to effectively wield two swords at the same time, and even then there's a limit to how well you can do it. Unless you are suffering from a rare neurolical condition, you hands will not move in two different ways at the same time. Have you ever tried drawing a triangle with one hand and a square with the other? It can't be done. The best I've ever managed is to draw two malformed rhombuses. For this reason it is unrealistic to expect a sword wielded in the off-hand, even if a character is truly ambidextrous, to be as effective as a sword weilded in the main hand. This is why most swordsman have traditionally opted out of the second weapon and instead imployed a larger, more damaging sword, or opted to use a shield, which are simple to use and provide protection besides. </p>

<p>Are the feats too much for too little? I'd say so, but it's also fairly realistic.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Linji, once-is-Rinzai</p>

<p>Appearance: </p>

<p>"Welcome to the House of Paintings!  You've always been here, even if you haven't always been -though nothing is been, all is becoming, and really nothing is becoming as well, but I digress (the *ollin* flows away)..." <br />
We are all just Masks -Illusions of Teotl -but illusions that are real, so perhaps not really illusions, at all -but as I said, all are illusions.  All masks conceal and reveal the Teotl; they present itself.  Teotl, as all,  *knows* this, but not all of teotl *knows* this.  What you see is just an illusion, and all the masks of teotl reveal and conceal.  Sometimes, Linji wishes certain masks concealed more, while other revealed more, but Linji doesn't always talk of Tanar'ri brothels in certain places...<br />
So, how does Linji's mask look to you?  What does it reveal, and what does it conceal?  Remember, the eye does not see itself -it takes part of self to see itself, but not all of self (Linji *knows* there is no self, or nonself, but self-unself becoming)...<br />
Look again, does Linji's mask change?  <br />
Or does your eye change?  <br />
Torpellin says, 'No, mind changes!'.  <br />
Linji says, 'Now, I *see*'".</p>

<p>~4th side of the Triangle, excerpts from the Unformed Circle of Linji</p>

<p>Due to Linji's Slaad influence as a Chaond, Linji's physical appearance varies according to his whim and environment, and although's Linji exact physical appearance changes in varying degrees and frequency, some things have remained relatively stable since arriving in the City of Doors.</p>

<p>Linji dresses in the somber gray cloak of the Zerth Cenobites; however, his cloak's inside has a rough patchwork of multitudes of colors, like a jumbled rainbow.  Around his neck, he wears a string of Limbo Lotus, harvested from the fields surrounding Xaos, from which Linji makes a special tea, bruning the rest, in a ritual that he claims extends his senses beyond himself, and greater awareness of teotl.  Regardless, he treasures, the beautiful white blossoms, each of which seem to constantly fold and fold their petals, revealing and concealing their inner nectar, that swirls like a microcosm of Limbo itself. <br />
Underneath his Githzerai cloak, Linji wears his old monastic robes, which are a muted black, tied with a white sash, its inner side stitched with the Circles runes of Gith, reciting the entire Unbroken Circle of Zerthimon.  He often has a well worn-if not-decrepit-satchel (supposedly made from ghoul-hide) slung over one shoulder, in which he keeps all kinds of knick-knacks and trinkets).   <br />
Unlike many monks, Linji does not wrap his hands or feet.  Instead, he wears a pair of soft leather moccassins -one a faded blue, stitched with patterns of cats and mice, and the other a muddy brown (Linji claims that his feet are different sizes, and so the mis-matched pair are more comfortable).  Around each of his hands is an amazingly complex tangle of thread ('looking like Linji somehow caught each hand in Cat's Cradle from Hell').  The knotted patterns do not seem to restrict the movement of his fingers or wrist, and close scrutiny reveals that each thread-pattern is different.  However, each thread-pattern holds a strange seal made of Karach on the back of Linji's hands. Its exact shape shifts, usually in a lanquid motion -the one vaguely looking like an intertwined snake devouring its own tail, and the other looking either like a sun, or a lion's head and mane, each with extruding snake-like bodies.  Those who have closely studied these Karach seals notice that occasionally writting of some kind appears on them, though shifting and fading.<br />
Usually orbiting around his head are two dull gray iouns, that drift lazily about in a haphazard motion. </p>

<p>Linji himself is also a strange, dynamic amalgram.  Like most Githzerai, Linji's skin is a pale yellow; however, upon the back of his arms, shoulder, back, and neck, his skin is spotted. These vague spots constantly shift, warping their shape, color, and location, almost like liquid drops of paint that refuses to dry.  Linji calls these splotches of color, "Flowers", or *Xochitl* in the Slaad tongue.  On top of these ever-shifting skin-markings, Linji has had applied several tatoos (some of which are of his own doings).  Upon his arms and left leg are spiraling tatoos of swimming blue fish.  On his left side of his chest (which is partially visible due to the cute of his robes), Linji has a red and orange tatoo of a Lotus of Fire.  The most amazing tatoo of Linji's is one he claims was penned by Fell, and is located upon his right shoulder, and is a chaotic pattern of black and white waves, which seems to dance and splash across his skin -the swarms of blue fish seeming to swim into their shifting waves.  Upon Linji's left check is another tatoo, depicting some strange creature looking like a near-translucent Slaadi and tadpole hybrid -which he calls *Anxihitl*.  Various other tatoos mark his skin, but are more obscure -which he claims are markations of his *Tonalli* -or temporal essence.</p>

<p>Linji stands 6 feet tall, though his arms seem a little too long for his frame.  And while Linji's arms and legs are well toned and sinewy, Linji has a large pot-belly.  Likewise, Linji's movements appear either exceedingly graceful or are jarringly adrupt (made all the more disturbing as Linji often "walks" on his hands).<br />
Linji lacks any fingernails whatsoever, as well as seeming to have the ability to bend his limbs in different directions.</p>

<p>Linji's face is rather typical of most Githerzerai (which means, thin and sharp angled, and yellow), except for his hair and eyes and teeth, which betray his Chaond nature.  Although his yellow irises are very common among the Githzerai, his pupils resemble that of Slaadi -being horizontal black ellipses.  Linji's hair is a full shock of white wispy hair, that seems to move on its own -Linji is constantly shaving sections, or braiding his hair -though it always unties itself or grows back, though it never seems to grow longer than a foot or two.  Unlike other male Githzerai of his age, Linji has no facial hair at all.  Linji's teeth are a unbecoming match of flat Zerth-like teeth, and Sharp Slaad teeth.  Luckily, Linji's long flexible tongue allows him to pronouce most languages without difficulty, despite his strange jaw-line (though when in deep thought, he does have an unsettling habit of tapping his nose with the tip of his tongue).</p>

<p>Another common sight around Linji is his "pet" Aoskian Hound named Wu (although somtimes he will call it Mu, or Mu and Wu).  <br />
Although Linji has diferent stories about Wu, his most common (and reasonable) story is that Wu was once a animal companion to a planewalking ranger named Zhaozhou.  Zhaozhou supposedly had traveled to Limbo, being force to leave behind Wu, but in Limbo met Linji, who overtime became fast friends.  It was through Zhaozhou that Linji heard of the stories about the fabled City of Doors.   Unfortunately, their time together was brought adruptly to an end when Zhao and Linji were attacked by a group of Hezrou (or was it Slaadi? -Linji doesn't recall).  Linji escaped the turmoil, only to later find the torn remains of Zhao's bloodstained cloak and shattered bow (which would have soon been consumed in the chaos matter of the plane).  Mourning his loss, Linji took his friend's cloak, and therein found a map and a port-key to Sigil, as well as a scribbled address.  It was only a matter of time, before Linji arrived in the City of Doors.  At the address, Linji claims to have found Wu, waiting for Zhou to return.  Linji and Wu took a liking to each other, and it was not too long thereafter that Wu would follow Linji wherever he went (though sometimes it is Linji following Wu).  </p>

<p>Wu is rather normal in build and size for Aoskian Hounds, but he is atypical in the "color" of his hair.  Suffice to say that Linji and Wu once traveled with the Painter for a period of time, and that Wu became a "canvas" -thus, Wu's pelt is painted with a splash of colors, circles, and spirals and vague shapes and stripes.   </p>

<p>Well, that's all for now, next time, I'll post Linji's backgorund/history.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Nice work Dialexis <img src="http://planewalker.com/sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/lol.png" title="Laughing out loud" alt="Laughing out loud" class="smiley-content"/> , I'll look forward to seeing Linji's history.<br />
<div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Linji lacks any fingernails whatsoever, as well as seeming to have the ability to bend his limbs in different directions.</div><br />
 :shock: It's a little scary that this was going to be one of the tiefling traits Kadar had. I ended up changing it for the lack of shadow thing on the day I posted him because it seemed a bit more fiendish.</p>

<p>Duckluck, the rule I was talking about was from 2e Planescape only and it stated that any magical enhancements were reduced by 1 per plane away from their plane of creation. This meant that Outlands and Sigil forged weapons were particularly sought after- they only lost 1 enhancement point no matter which plane you were on.<br />
It's a bit of a pain so I can see why it was dropped.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Hopefully helpful observations:</p>

<p>Well, I reviewed the character sheets and here is what I came up with (of ocurse I could be making a mistake too, so take comments with a grain of salt).</p>

<p>Kadar,<br />
 <br />
All good to go.</p>

<p>Cortek,</p>

<p>Adamantine Longsword has to be MW (as all adamantine weapons are, thus price should be 3,315, not current listed price of 3,015 gp) -MW bonus already incorporated into attack bonus.</p>

<p>Skill points have not had armor penalties applied.</p>

<p>Skills currently do not have Acrobatic house-rule applied (climb has 8 ranks, but none in jump -apply both, but also remember the armor penalty ).</p>

<p>Skills currently have Awareness, instead of seperate Listen and Spot.</p>

<p>Besides those minor issues, everything else was fixed in the interum.</p>

<p>Hope that helps.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Actually, the Adamantine Cost is NOT an error, Dialexis. The cost for special materials subsumes the cost of masterworking (see the Mithral and Adamantine entries in the SRD/DMG).</p>

<p>Lin looks cool, Dialexis. I actually feel kinda bad - I'm a much more mechanical player, and it's going to be tough to come up with a really compelling character concept (especially in Planescape).</p>

<p>I'm working on a couple of character sheets - I tend to get an idea of the character once I have some mechanics down. Currently, I've got a Bladeling Wu Jen (Elemental Focus - Metal, of course), as well as my old backup idea (Tiefling Beguiler).</p>

<p>I should have a preliminary fluff sheet up today.</p>

<p>_</p>

<p>I like the armor system, but there's one main problem.</p>

<p>Diversity.</p>

<p>There are three/six armors worth using, and one shield, and I can list them off the top of my head.</p>

<p>The first are either specific armors or don't get much use due to their absurdly high dexterity requirements to use efficiently.</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">Thistleweave Padded Leather (+1/+10)<br />
Leafweave Studded Leather (+3/+7)</span><br />
<span style="font-weight:bold">Celestial Chainmail (+5/+8)</span></p>

<p>Now, here's the three real armors.</p>

<p>Mithral Chain Shirt. (Light)<br />
Mithral Breastplate. (Light)<br />
Mithral Full Plate (Medium</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

"why can't you just leave me alone?"he groned looking itno the horizon.Blue strands filling his view.In the distance the sounds of death and battle could be heard and like smoke more blue strands rose in collums."I said why can't you just leave me alone!"he screamed into the air.<br />
A mass of strands came near him and he felt hate and rage boil inside him."Go away,I hate you."he hissed.the blue mob did not budge.<br />
His body filled with rage focused on the mass."I hate you all."the blue strands began to be pulled twoards his arms,even as they made to move away."I loathe you,I hate you!"he screamed the blue turned red and wrapped around his arms and beagan to take the shape of a pair of gauntlets,in them were screaming  and moaning faces of hellish origon.<br />

         <p>Perro- Intriguing</p>

<p>Oberoni_Fallacy- I like the sound of the Bladeling Wu Jen myself, but I've always liked Bladelings and I'm interested to see a Wu Jen in action. btw if there's the wood element (I think there is but I don't have the book here) that would also be appropriate.</p>

<p>Oh, and while I remember- two weapons aren't that hard to wield simultaneously, especially if they're relatively light. The reductions in D&amp;D are pretty accurate - if you're not trained in doing it then it does your head in, if you use heavy weapons it's a struggle (although I can see how people'd make it work) but using light weapons isn't that much harder than using a single weapon (or your hands for that matter). <br />
For real-world examples look at most Filipino martial arts and the sword &amp; dirk style which was relatively popular for a couple of centuries in Europe (although the exact weapons changed a bit in this time. The off-hand weapon is often used defensively and can replace a shield quite effectively because of it's agility.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Perro,</p>

<p>I really like the intro -as Azriael said, it is definately intriguing -and makes me anxious to hear more.  But great intro!  </p>

<p>Also, thanks for the pm -I'm not that familiar with Incarnum, so I wasn't sure.  Admittedly, even if Linji does the Sacred Fist, his healing capability will be nowhere near a cleric of his level (but perhaps with your later healing abilities/options, our combined healing abilities might be at least decent enough).</p>

<p>Regardless, he seems very cool.</p>

<p>Oberoni_Fallacy,</p>

<p>Kudos on the adamantine correction.  Also, even though I don't want to spin off on too big of a tangent, your Han build was a great read, and I also really agree with your premises on 2nd vs. 3rd edition.  Like Duckluck said, (and as a gamer who has played in all three editions), 3rd is definately the best -is it perfect for all in all situations -no.  However, it (to me) has done the best, holistically.  I don't want to bog down in specifics due to the nature of this thread (as well as not wanting to cause rifts between the group), but I did want to say that your ideas were well put, and are harmonious with mine.</p>

<p>Also, thanks for the compliment of Linji.  Admittedly, I want each of our characters to give something to each other (metagame-wise, complimenting crunch abilities, and metagame-wise, facets of flavor/fluff that are enjoyable) -its one of the reasons why the dialectic of D&amp;D is so enjoyable to me.  Thus, I am glad you like his concept.</p>

<p>I am also really excited about all the other PCs as well -those finished and those still on the proposal table.</p>

<p>Personally (thus, do what you like, I'm just throwing in my two cents), I'd say go for the Wu Jen -we need the "arcane artillery", and the Beguiler lacks in that measure with their more limited magical focus.</p>

<p>Like Azriael said, Wood might be interesting with the Hriste-tie in, but as you said, Metal is the most obvious choice, as well (in my observation) has the better spell selection.  </p>

<p>If you do Bladeling, that will be interesting as Perro's PC is (unless he has changed it) a Bladeling as well).  Not to step on anyone's toes (especially not Duckluck's), but perhaps the two of your characters could have some mutual background -(it would help initial party solidarity and identity, as well as explain the confluence of the two).  That said, the two Bladelings might also know to some degree or another Cortek -as he has been on Archeron as a new "home".  Of course, the plane is infinite, but stories are built from interconnectedness.  Just my two cents.</p>

<p>Regardless, I look forward to seeing your PC. </p>

<p>Cortek,</p>

<p>As said, I was just pointing out minor blips still there.  Applying the penalties dynamically could get a little tedious, but that is up to you and Duckluck.  </p>

<p>And, Duckluck, correct me if I speak incorrectly, but Awareness was ultimately decided against, and Acrobatics was retained.</p>

<p>As for which skills take penalties, they are:</p>

<p>Balance, Climb, Escape Artist, Jump, Hide, Move Silently, Swim, and Tumble.</p>

<p>*remember that for Swim checks, the penalty is doubled.</p>

<p>Oh, and one last question, is Cortek a member of any faction?  (I'm not advocating that we all need to be -Linji is really a floater, but what can you expect from a Chaond?)</p>

<p>JOR,</p>

<p>M'rek looks great -really powerful build you have there -puts all of our sneaking thus far to shame (which is fine by me).  I noticed you decided against the lightning genasi; I'm curious as to the reason (not saying it is a bad choice, just interested).  </p>

<p>As for the 1,000 gp, you could enchant your armor, or get a +1 cloak.  Or, why not get a wand of cure light wounds (please).  </p>

<p>Curious also with the "alignment" section -is Ethereal an option (I mean all the Outer have corresponding ethical/moral ethos and belief -wherewas the Ethereal is a Transitive and lacks is amoral and without any ethical attachment).  Nathri have an amoral, chaotic bent  -I have no clue what Fiendish anscestry M'rek has, so that influence is unknown.  </p>

<p>I'll be very curious to hear his background. (and what to make sure Linji doesn't get on his bad side).</p>

<p>~and Duckluck -well M'rek has a 16 Con, so lol, Linji remains the squishiest -oh well.</p>

<p>Well that does it for me now (I'll be posting Linji's background later tonight).</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>He's a former Harmonium of course, but right now he has no faction affliation. </p>

<p>He'd probably fit in with the Sodkillers, it's almost a perfect fit. He also has some things in common with the Transcendent Order: when "negotiating", intimidation is all he knows, and he tends to back up his words before he says them. Despite being a staunch opponent of wealth and those who abuse it, he could probably be a member of the Fated(I probably would've made him a Khaasta if it weren't for their crazy level adjustment).</p>

<p>All in all, he doesn't completely agree with anyone, and he NEVER changes his mind due to outside influence, so he'll probably never be in a faction.</p>

Duckluck denied me that choice earlier in this thread, he said only Outer Planes were valid, though I think the whole Nathri thing brings a compelling argument, I guess I just registered "ideal plane" as the Plane that that character considers paradise, and that we were just going to judge their dispositions from that: if we just stick to the alignment planes then we may as well be using the standard Alignment system pretty much. But it's all up to Duckluck, I don't really care either way..</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Humf. It appears it was unreasonable to expect my players to actually read everything I've written in the last couple weeks. Here are some clarifications for ya'll.</p>

<p>Acrobatics and Literacy are the only amalgamated feats I chose to use. Awareness and Stealth are out.</p>

<p>As I said in my initial post, if anyone had asked to play a high-powered monster race like a Khaasta, we would have worked somethign out. Too late now though.</p>

<p>The Ethereal is not a a valid place to choose to spend your afterlife. Even for a Nathri. That would be like if I died and my final reward was an eternity in New Jersey. It's not a (very) bad place to be, but it's not exactly what I'd call a heavenly or hellish realm.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Hmm, okay I loved your character Dialexis, and I thought I'd post what I sent you earlier so that our fellows can be shocked and amazed!</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div><span style="font-style:italic">...and on these seals, strange markings seem to have been etched along the rims. On closer examination, the markings appear to form a writing of sorts, but the runic characters are miniscule and move and shift as you stare. As you squint to better read the fine etchings, they seem to move faster and faster until they are nothing but a shapeless blur. The effect is enough to nauseate even a hardened Limbo-walker like yourself, and you have to struggle to keep your eyes from crossing. Without really meaning to, you unfocus your eyes on the blur of text as it spirals and twists. Suddenly, in a moment of insight that you know must be a gift from the Cadence of the Planes, you stop trying to make sense of the blurred lines and decide to look between them. Immedately, you notice that the swirling lines never cover certain areas, and those blank spaces, the only true meaning of the text is to be found. In plane, readable, block letters, circling around the edges of the seal, is spelled out a message of obvious import,</p>

<p>"Blood of my blood, son of my son, you have learned to find truth where there was nothing, and saw the lies that substance hid. *Know* that truth and lies exist in all things in equal measure, and that unless you *know* both the truths and the lies, you will never truly *know* either. Even this paltry legacy of mine contains many truths and many lies. *Know* that in order to use it properly, you must know the truth but believe the lies. If you would would seek to *know* the nature of the objects you hold, seek out Shi'ixrasti the Slaad, and R-28 the Modron. Both can be found in the City of Doors, and both charge extensively for their services. Finally, *know* that a truth that you do not understand is worse than a lie that you do."</p>

<p>As you finish reading between the lines, you suddenly realize that that many words would have a dozen disks to write, but as you try to see how it fits, you realize that the lines have stopped moving and the words that still ring in your mind are nowhere to be seen. </span></div></p>

<p>Oh, and to Perro. Did you try to use <a href="http://www.campaign-blog.com" class="bb-url">Campaign-Blog?</a> It isn't quite as good as 3eProfiler, but it's good enough for me.</p>

<p>JOR, you should buy a Wand of Cure Light wounds... for the good of the nation.</p>

<p>OF, just play the Wu Jen. You know you want to.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Duckluck, could you please outline what sort of information is common knowledge for planars in your campaign? A list of sources that we are allowed to read and use would be ideal but general parameters would be fine too. I'm just re-reading chapters 6 &amp; 7 of PSCS at the moment as that seemed pretty safe. What about the 2e stuff like "In the cage" and "The Factols manifesto"?</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

Nice work on the standard Astraloth stats btw</div></p>

<p>Well, that certainly hit me flat-footed.  Shemeska's SH#1 is fantastic, and between him (or her if you prefer), Solarious, and I had a good time hammering out Shemeska's "literary" creation into an entity with mechanics usable to others.  I had thought the project was done, but Solarious has carried on, I see (I had a good chuckle at my "namesake").</p>

<p>Anyways, thanks for lettling me know -I was able to get back to him on a couple of his questions/comments.  Despite the nice (or humorous) gesture, I did say that Dialexis is a name already taken (both as an entity within/in the Planes, but also, and more importantly, as a term that has RL meaning, one that doesn't mesh well at all with CR 47 Astraloths).</p>

<p>Regardless, it isn't everyday that someone creates a soul-sucking fiend and names it after you -but, as they say, "Never look a gift horse in the mouth."  But seriously, Solarious has been great to work with, and thanks for informing me of his recent posts.</p>

<p>Off that tangent...</p>

<p>Obernoi_Fallacy,</p>

<p>"OF, just play the Wu Jen. You know you want to."</p>

<p>Hmm, I got a laugh out of this one too, In my mind I read,</p>

<p> <img src="http://planewalker.com/sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/lol.png" title="Laughing out loud" alt="Laughing out loud" class="smiley-content"/> </p>

<p>But seriously, I can't say I disagree (well, I could, but then I wouldn't be telling the truth now, would I?)</p>

<p>Duckluck,</p>

<p>Good to hear the clarification of the "alignment" issue.  Such was what I thought you had said (and also my thought as well).  Good to actually have it spelled out by the boss though.</p>

<p>Ditto on the skill issue.</p>

<p>And, I am glad you liked Linji's character description. (and appreciate you waiting to post your "expo" till then).</p>

<p>As said, I'll be posting Linji's character background in a bit.</p>

<p>Till then.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>In any case, I won the CO Contest! This means I will have way more free time (and free stuff.)</p>

<p>In any case, I want to talk to you guys about a couple things.</p>

<p>First off, I'm playing the Wu Jen - Metal (which has the coolest spells). I'm going to get the rod that allows double element mastery as soon as I can and grab Wood or Fire, though.</p>

<p>Secondly, my planescape knowledge is really spotty. On the one hand, I have a fairly decent working knowledge of the Blood War and of other random things, and I know most of the setting stuff.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I can't speak in cant worth a damn, and I'll probably stumble if I try to name all the factions. Why does this apply? Because I will probably get things wrong. If I do, please attempt to correct me if it seems more of a player than character mistake - the beauty of Play-by-Post is that we get an Edit Post button.</p>

<p>In addition, I'd like to know a bit more about Bladelings. In all honesty, my knowledge of them is the half-page blurb in the Planescape campaign setting.</p>

         <p>Sensates, Harmonium and Ciphers. Also the Mercykillers Split into the Sodkillers (which you have) and the Sons of Mercy.<br />
It might not be a bad idea to read up on some of the sources that Duckluck gives in answer to my last question although bladelings are pretty insular so that could explain your lack of planar knowledge.<br />
Also, there doesn't seem to be a great deal written about bladelings. The 2e "Planes of Law" has a few pages worth and could help you out, there's a bit of info in PW forums and articles and I think Rip had something on his site.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I actually never really read much of  the 2e PS stuff, OF has more of it than I do. At any rate, I don't think there's a hard and fast rule as to how much a planar should know.</p>

<p>Basically, a planar-born character should know: Sigil's wards and a few of the heavy-hitters in town, most of the Gatetowns and their corresponding planes, where a couple of heavilly used portals are, the general makeup of the planes, and the details of any place they've actually lived. That's about it. Most important things will be covered through knowledge checks (Local, Geography, and especially The Planes), with the appropriate circumstance modifiers added in, of course.</p>

<p>Most people who've live in Sigil know the Factions (and more than a few sects and guilds), but if you ask them to make a list, they might come up with something like OF's. </p>

<p>You two did well naming the factions, but can you name all the sects?</p>

<p>Order of the Planes Millitant<br />
The Expansionists<br />
The Society of Pain<br />
The Daughters of Light<br />
The Mathematicians</p>

<p>Um, hmm. Anyone want to help me out?</p>

         <p>Oberoni_Fallacy,</p>

<p>Congratulations on your well desired victory!</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;Oberoni_Fallacy&#039;</em> wrote:</div>
Dialexis is epic. Normal rules don't apply to him.</div></p>

<p>Oh man, that's going to haunt me isn't it?</p>

<p>Anyways, about normal rules, I do believe that Ride checks don't suffer amor check penalties (despite being a Dex based skill).  Also, things like normal Strength checks would not be hampered by armor (though I can see Dex checks as being affected).</p>

<p>*as a armorless monk, I'm not directly involved, but I don't want to have Cortek miffed.</p>

<p>Regardless, I'm happy to hear you are going with the Wu Jen (metal).  The idea of going with another element is interesting (I would suggest Wood due to their fervor of/for Hrist, or go with water, since Ocanthus is made of the frozen shards of Styx).</p>

<p>As for Bladeling info, I have some info I could give you (though it is quite extensive and long, and so it would be best if I sent it in several pms).  If interested, let me know -I will give the caveat that some of it includes tie-ins to not only Planescape lore, but also to DF lore, and some of my own work (I want to be upfront with it, that's all).</p>

<p>As for Sigil cant -Linji doesn't use it all that much (his langauge use is too personal and eclectic to stay true to any one kind of dialect).  </p>

<p>But yes, as has been said, Bladelings are very xenophobic, and thus, would not be likely (in most circumstances) to quickly adopt externally racial dialects -such as cant (despite learning terminology).</p>

<p>The degree to which DMs use Sigil cant (and expect/desire their player's PCs to do so) varies, and so I guess we really need Duckluck's opinion.</p>

<p>For instance, in Duckluck's version of Sigil, will all non-cant speakers be considered Clueless?  (I hope not; I have to admit that if a Solar walks by Linji and says, "Move it berk, or ye might end yerself in the Dead Book!" that Dialexis will be a sad Dialexis indeed).</p>

<p>-Sects: I know that there are the sects of the Doomguard.</p>

<p>Otherwise, there is also the Gloryhounds.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

          M&#039;rek and wands...        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>First of all, thanks for all the input. which generated more questions. Here they are:<br />
Duckluck: regarding my ideal plane, two options:<br />
A)I read that the Nathri most people encounter are nomads roaming the ethereal, but it also hints that they have are very misterious demiplane, or pocket plane, or whatever of origin hidden deep within the ethereal...would that plane be an adequate ideal plane...the idea is that the Nathry roam the ethereal always looking for their ideal home, and those who had led a worthy life are lead back to this ancestral homeland after they die...<br />
b) I am also toying with the idea of having the M'rek not KNOW where he would go after death...Nathri live such secluded lives that they are more or less permeated by the essence of the ethereal, only after experiencing life outside the ethereal would his spirit know where to go after death (so he would start "neutral" and slowly shift towards one of the other alignments as the game progresses...would that be ok? I figure that this could be true for all Nathri, except that those who die without ever leaving the ethereal, would just reincarnate as baby Nathri somewhere within the same clan until they could amke a decision...this quest for self-knowledge would be for many Nathri one of the main reasons for leaving the clan...<br />
The third option, (I know i mentioned only two, but those would be options of choice, this is just default) would be to pick a Neutral aligned plane ...still looking</p>

<p>As fat as the wand of healing...I think we would be making a mistake having M`rek as the healer ...here is why...<br />
Even maxing on use item his chance of activating the wand of healing would be only 45%...whereas Azriael`s character could use a wand of healing with NO miss chance. See the SRD transcript below:</p>

<p>Spell Trigger: Spell trigger activation is similar to spell completion, but it’s even simpler. No gestures or spell finishing is needed, just a special knowledge of spellcasting that an appropriate character would know, and a single word that must be spoken. Anyone with a spell on his or her spell list knows how to use a spell trigger item that stores that spell. (This is the case even for a character who can’t actually cast spells, such as a 3rd-level paladin.) The user must still determine what spell is stored in the item before she can activate it. Activating a spell trigger item is a standard action and does not provoke attacks of opportunity.</p>

<p>That being said, I think that the party should all pitch in for buying the wand (it could be done in game, as soon as we are assembled and realise that have no cleric...this should mean something like 150 gp each...easily done!</p>

<p>As for the sugestions on how to spend my remaining money, thanks...I would consider buying a +1 to my armour, BUT I guess I do not have ~quite~ 1000gp...also I would like to know from Duckluck what is his stance on alchemical items and poisons...what about the alchemical items on the complet adventurer (other than those fake teeth thingies which I hate...)...would that be ok? Finally what is your stance on buying "used" wands for lesser money such as buying a wand of shield with 25 charges for half the DMG cost? </p>

<p>As for the lightning genasi question versus the thiefling: will answer in another e-mail...got to go...</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>A Solar would never say that. A Solar would say, "Pardon me cutter, but you seem to be in my way. Would you please move? Well that, cutter, was just plain rude. I am a *Proxy* of St. Cuthbert you know. I understand that you didn't know who I am, cutter, and I can understand that from a prime, but a canny planar like yourself should really watch what you say.   You never know when a bad blood like that positively bea-nasty fiend Shemeska is going to be upset by your words and decide to inscribe you into the book of the dead.  Take heed, cutter, even Aasimon like myself are not immune to maliciousness. I personally have known many an angel that is said to have had a "dirty" or "bloody" halo. Spire's ward, cutter, and I hope next time we meet you behave yourself in a more savvy manner."</p>

<p>Cant will be used often and to great effect, but never to the point where it makes my posts unreadable (unless that's what I have in mind). Note that among the dozens of slang terms are many other words that even the highest Golden Lord would be seen as a sucessful Clueless for not using. Pay attention to the titles (berk, basher, cutter, blood, and the like), and the salutations (Spire's ward, Lady's grace, etc), they will be used often and with numerous variants, for these will be the default words rather than things like sir, madam, and goodbye. Anyone who thinks cant can only be used for slang and vulgarity obviously isn't trying hard enough.</p>

<p>Edit: <br />
JOR, you can put your alignment as "in flux" which basically means "whatever the hells I [the DM] feel like." Otherwise, you can pick a plane, any plane and go there. One interesting thing is that the Ethereal isn't connected to the Outer planes or the Astral, so, theoretically, if you die on the Ethereal you could theoretically be trapped forever as a ghost on the Border Ethereal, or you would have to journey to the Prime and attempt to ascend from there. Either way, the Ethereal wouldn't be your final destination, but would be the place you got stuck while you were trying to get to your final destination. lastly, I don't really like the demi-plane idea. I think the origin plane should serve as a bit of a cultural myth, but not a final destination for departed souls, although it's possible that many Nathri ghosts would end up there anyway, I suppose. If your character is really uncertain about the ethics of everything, you should have your aligned plane be the Plane of Concordant Opposition itself, the Outlands.</p>

<p>Holy crap! <span style="font-style:italic">I forgot Kadar could use wands!</span>You know what this means, you should<span style="font-style:italic"> both</span> buy wands! Also, the group is going to meet in game, and you may not have time to buy wands for a while (hint, hint). If that's a risk you wish to take to save cash, then so be it, but you could always set up a pay-per-charge racket.</p>

<p>I can't remember what the alchemichal items you are reffering to are, and I'm not going to rubber stamp them until I get a chance to look them up. Is there any particular item you had in mind?</p>

<p>No used wands. To put it frankly, they scare me, because I have no idea how to price them intelligently.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>as far as sects go I'm a bit shaky (there's so many) but the Guardians, Disposessed, Vile Hunt, Anarchs guild, Converts and the Wylders spring to mind. Were the Expansionists a sect?

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Ok. as for the choice of thiefling over lightning:<br />
Two considerations came into play - <br />
role playing a half demon seemed to me more achievable than a genasi, especially since I would already be testing new waters with the Nathri...<br />
mechanical - well it became clear that I was going to be the group`s skill monkey, so intelligence trumped charisma...which reminds me  who will negotiate for the group? Kadar? Our Wu gen?</p>

<p>I included a CLW wand in my equipment but you all better pay M'rek for the privillege...or at least pat him well on the head...</p>

<p>Finally, as for the alchemicals I am interested in (from CA) flashpellet and catstink...also, maybe, the longspoon, if they are allowed...<br />
cheers</p>

<p>As for languages, what should M`rek pick? What would make sense? Although a planar, I want to picture M'reck as coming from the planar boondocks, so to speak, as close to being a savage to the eyes of civilised Spire people as possible...in my clan, the little outside contact we have had would be with our raids on Githzeray slave traders (who would also raid our clan for slaves)...what would be other options? I do not think I should speak cant, but is there any other lingua franca for the planes?</p>

<p>Ah. one more poll for the group...I can learn TWO 1st level wizard spells from the abjuration, transmutation, illusion, divination and charm schools...one will be reduce person, because it will be so much fun to be tiny...what should be the other? Remember these will be the only spells I ever learn as a spellthief, and later I'll have a very limited access to spells as an assassin...<br />
thanks, cheers</p> <div class="dice_rolls">
