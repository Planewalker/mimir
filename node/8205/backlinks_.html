</div> <p>Alright, so first off: sorry to anyone who clicked on this forum looking for an adventure to download. That's not what this is about.</p>

<p>I see a lot of threads on this site and on Wizards about people new to Planescape who are looking to get into it. They're either trying to find a game to join, or trying to learn how to DM Planescape, or trying to learn what Planescape is all about.</p>

<p>This is great.</p>

<p>As much as we like to complain about how Wizards of the Coast is beyond redemption in their black, black souls for corrupting our favorite campaign setting with their heretical Manual of the Planes and Planar Handbook and Guide to Frustrating Stalwart Campaign Setting Fans (okay, so I made that last one up), Wizards has attracted a lot of new players to what would otherwise be a feeble and languishing setting, sputtering on through the stubbornness of its last fan base. It's fantastic that we're actually seeing <span style="font-style:italic">new</span> interest in Planescape.</p>

<p>I'd really like for there to be a levels-1-through-3 adventure available for download that would include everything a DM needs to run his first half-dozen Planescape sessions. It'd make the considerable task of diving into Planescape that much simpler and less intimidating.</p>

<p>So, I guess what I'm doing is just gauging support for this. I don't claim to have the adventure-writing expertise to do this myself, but I'd certainly love to help, perhaps by cranking out stats (I don't mind clunking through a wide variety of books). In other words, I'm essentially proposing that someone else grab the steering wheel here and requesting that someone who isn't me step forward and do a lot of work that I'd like to see done for no compensation.</p>       </div>

         <p>I couldn't agree more Rhys, and it seems that recently more and more folk on the threads are saying that PSCS is their first experience of Planescape. That's brilliant, but Planewalker is frankly more than a bit hamstrung by a lack of complete scenarios. </p>

<p>Planescape had such a strong feel from the writing team (and DiTerlizzi's artwork) and so many powerful new concepts, that (in the opinion of my group at least), the initial published scenarios were necessary to unify those concepts into a coherent whole, for <span style="font-style:italic">players </span>as well as DMs... and perhaps most importantly illustrate the differences between PS and what we might call 'regular' D&amp;D - the very thing that attracted most of us in the first place.</p>

<p>If planewalker.com could pull off the same trick, it would be near perfect.</p>

<p>Writing a <span style="font-style:italic">complete </span>scenario however, ready for someone else to run <span style="text-decoration:underline">without any input from the author</span>, is a LOT more work, and pretty daunting unless you write a lot (not necessarilly <span style="font-style:italic">paid</span>, just <span style="font-style:italic">practised</span>). </p>

<p>That said however, I've done it a couple of times for my gaming society's fanzine, homegrown system, and to take to the British 'RPG student nationals', and the main requirements (Rule of Threes immanent, berks!) are only:</p>

<p>1) The confidence to write<br />
2) A supportive bunch of playtesters/editors to help you<br />
3) The actual time to do it.</p>

<p>Based off the many PSCS articles I've coo'ed over in the last few months, there's plenty of talented writers, based on forums I've been to, there's plenty of those folk who are helpful. That only leaves our prospective authors to deal with number 3...</p>

<p>Course, any berk can spout some screed about how 'easy' all this is when he's not doing it himself.... so I hereby promise to get the ball rolling with the first draft of a proper scenario WITHIN THE NEXT SEVEN DAYS. To tell the truth, I've been kicking this adventure (for brand new primer and planar PCs of 1st level, in Sigil) about for a bit so I'm not starting entirely from scratch, but now I've shot my mouth off, I have to finish.</p>

<p>Thanks for the offer of help on the number-crunching by the way... that might be a big help for folks.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I third that idea (as long as it doesn't cut into my ability to rant about WotC mangling the details <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/smile.png" title="Smiling" alt="Smiling" class="smiley-content"/> ). As for writing, I would like to think that I have both the confidence and some ability to write, clearing me for 1/3. I also believe that Planewalker has plenty of supportive criticizers, giving me 2/3. Time, however, is something that I struggle with. I would like to say that I just don't have enough of it, but looking at other people, it becomes painfully evident that I just can't manage time worth a flip. So, were I to learn that, it would be 3/3. But, as blasphemous as it is, I shall break the Rule of Threes and note that there's a fourth aspect that you're forgetting - ideas. You need some original ideas to write anything worth playing, and my own talent in that I cannot judge, as my muse comes and goes. That's where I personally stand in the writing department.</p>

<p>Drawing I need some practice with, especially if I want to approach a style anywhere near DiTerlizzi. His style is essential to Planescape, in my opinion, and it would be wise to either emulate it or rob a bank and hire him. We could, of course, come up with an entirely new and original style for PS3.5e, but it would have to be very consistent.</p>

<p>With winter break coming up and college letting me off the hook for a month, I shall try to come up with an idea and make a pdf adventure, but unfortunately I really can't promise I can deliver until I actually sit down and do it. But the more the better, right?</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I'm delighted to see some solid interest in getting this going. I look forward to seeing what Armoury has in mind. Like I said, my biggest problem is the big-picture concept of the adventure. I can write encounters and string them together, but I always seem to lack a big idea to center around.</p>

<p>One thought: We're looking to make the job easy for the DM, but is it going to be tough for the players to write compelling PCs? Planescape characters are arguably just as different from their "regular D&amp;D" analogs as is the setting itself. It'd probably be worthwhile to include a batch of adventurers along with it. That seems to be the typical procedure for ready-to-go, "demo-style" adventures, as far as I've seen. If someone wanted to introduce a bunch of gamers to Planescape at a convention, he'd have ready-to-go characters for them.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Let me iterate Rhys' mention that we should start small. Although <span style="text-decoration:underline">Faction War</span> and <span style="text-decoration:underline">Die Vecna, Die!</span> were memorable plane-shattering adventures, they should not be the norm, even in a place as odd as the multiverse. Small, local adventures, covering two to three planes and Sigil should be more than enough for a start. If we want to start something huge (such as the *Holy/Peace War* idea that's hanging somewhere around the forums in a state of limbo for the time being), it should really be a group project. These small adventures for lvls 1-10 can be created by one person, and are easier to both build experience on and playtest.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Well, I'm not sure how we want to do this. Most of the major planar races (all the Planetouched, for instance) have level adjustments that make them unsuitable both as characters for newer players who might not understand the mechanics behind Level Adjustments (which isn't surprising considering they don't work, but that's a rant for another time), and because you can't have a balanced set of first level characters if half of them have Level Adjustments.</p>

<p>So how about:<br />
An Inner Planar Shad Ranger who is planar but clueless,</p>

<p>A Sigilian Planar Gnome Bard who isn't sure what to make of his clueless companions,</p>

<p>An Oerthian Xeph Psion who is a prime, but anything but clueless (I know Xeph and psionics aren't Core, but they are in the SRD, so they aren't exactly hard to find. Besides, Psionics have always been a part of PS),</p>

<p>A Torilian Human Barbarian who is very, very far from the jungles of Chult,</p>

<p>An Eberronian Dwarf Rogue who just found out everything he ever knew about the planes is wrong,</p>

<p>And maybe another one if you can think of a niche I'm missing. </p>

<p>If you guys like those, I'd be happy to come up with names, alignments and personalities for each, although actual stats may have to wait until I have time.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Rhys &amp; Company,</p>

<p>I laud the idea.  Infact, something important I feel for this community is not merely to sigh and "talk o' the good days", but to further append and progress the setting.  The PSCS is an absolutely excellent example of such.  The idea of a campaign follows perfectly along this line.</p>

<p>My proposal is that we learn from Dungeon's recent successes.  Instead of merely a single, stand alone adventure, I propose we do an adventure arc.  </p>

<p>Although it would be terrific to do an entire campaign, I think it would be far more realistic and prudent to do a smaller set -perhaps three related adventure modules.  Each would have a side-bar that would detail how they could be used as a stand-alone/independant adventure if so desired.  </p>

<p>Not only would this allow a relative diversity and pull (people have generally been far more interested in published adventures -statistically- if there is some product that can be used in conjunction to make the whole greater than the sum or all the parts), but this would also keep us from investing in 1. time and 2. effort is there is no significant reception from the populace (as well as allow enough of a "data" pool to draw conclusions on how to advance/correct any changes in future products).</p>

<p>Also, I would stress that it should be a team project.  </p>

<p>Organization should follow as such (or something along its lines):</p>

<p>1. Loose perameters should be discussed (most of which already has been, so this step is just about done).</p>

<p>2. Adventure Arc proposals should be given (really just rough ideas -i.e. the basic "thread", with perhaps a very short summary of what the three adventures might be).</p>

<p>3. The community (in this case, those on this thread) should discuss the merits of various proposals.  In the end, one idea (with perhaps synthesis of several others in part) should be selected -hopefully this will be done by a consensus.  If this requires soft voting, ok, but in the end, I say it should be ratified by Rhys (the "official" director of the project).</p>

<p>4. Once a rough concept is chosen, then the work really begins.  With the very, very rough idea already in place, the first adventure -prooject should start by selecting a project leader.  (Who may or may not be the same for all three modules of the arc).</p>

<p>The project leader does not necessarily need to be the original creator of the idea, nor the main writer -instead, they serve as the nominal organizational head -helping to dole out project, and acting as a moderator between ideas, and the final say on what stays and what goes -although the real goal is to reach a consensus.  </p>

<p>Depending on the nature of the adventure, the project leader will outline the adventure -and then with a skeleton in place will be able to assigh sections to flesh out (i.e. someone to handle the artwork on the minotaur bodyguard and his warlock mistress, or someone to stat the traps in the shrine of the Steaming Fen, and someone else to write up the sample PCs).  </p>

<p>During this step the rough drafts could all be displayed for the thread-community to view and give suggestions and opinions on, with the project leader starting up threads for questions and finding the resources needed -i.e. tech support for formatting it all, final editors, etc.</p>

<p>5. Playtesters are needed -specifically more than one group -with at least one DM'd by a PS rookie and another by a veteran.</p>

<p>6. Planewalker bigwigs take a look at polish draft, make any necessary changes, and *poof* it is ready to post as a completed project.</p>

<p>7. Once the first project is done, the second one is started, with all the same steps -making any modifications as experience relates and teaches.</p>

<p>That all said...</p>

<p>I agree with sample PCs, but I think we should make the adventures neutral in the sense that you don't have use them.  This would be very similar to what many 2nd Edition modules did -at the back, or stapled in themiddle were a bunch of sample PCs -usually more than four for more variety, but were never mentioned in the actual adventure itself).</p>

<p>As for adventure level, well that is a bit trickier. (Although I feel we should start it at 10th level, I can concede that we may want to gear it to beginners, starting at the beginning)</p>

<p>Honestly, many PS fans enjoy the wide racial options, and to pick to start at 1st level really limits it. </p>

<p>My recommendation:</p>

<p>Have the first one be a module for 3rd or 4th level characters.</p>

<p>If the Players choose a PC with no LA -then it is ok -it is still a relatively low-level campaign -especially since no caster can use a 3d level spell (those are really big milestones in campaign design as you have to consistently work around/with PCs casting fireballs and fly, etc).</p>

<p>At the same time, most LA -PS-PC races have LA+2, or +1, and so Players would have a wide variety from the get-go, and still have a level or two.  (This is especially important since most groups will have a mix of LA and non-LA PCs).</p>

<p>Thus, the adventure arc would be something along the lines of:</p>

<p>1st module -3/4th level<br />
2nd module -5/6th level (thus incorporating those spells, but not having the issues of consistent scry, sending, and teleport)<br />
3rd module -7/8th (with its terminus having a potential CR 12 BBEG or somesuch, which gives a lot of option is is still relatively remarkable, as well as only at the very end, needing to worry about mass sendings and scrying).</p>

<p>*Note, I have no problem with higher or even epic level play and their spells, but it is only logical to state that such inclusion is more difficult from a campaign design -and as this is our first such attempt, we should set goals as such.</p>

<p>Something to note in conclusion is that we should consider not only touching upon old subjects (such as having Sigil being a major point of the arc, with some references or revisting old sites, but we should also pick an area to develop something -so that to the "graybeards" there is something new to offer as well).</p>

<p>As for art -well, it is a very tricky situation.  I'm not going to "rob a bank" and so we are out of luck -the grandmaster of PS art is beyond our reach. (at least mine).</p>

<p>I think trying to copy his style would be practically impossible -everything will look like cheap knockoffs.</p>

<p>Instead, I think we should adopt an original style -we will still want to keep the "spirit/geist" and stay true to canon.  Part of the project leaders job will be to review submitted art proposals, and to select a group of artists.  Specifically, one shouls be selected for most of the "interior" art -i.e. NPCs and actionshots, while secondary artists could help (sidebar art to go along with sidebar stats on a new magic item, or computer graphics to assist with scroll and border work).<br />
Like the project leader, the primary artist need not be the same for all three modules.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Ok, I know it generally is not kosher to double post, but I hope you'll forgive me: I wanted to seperate my first post (which is more of an objectional draft on the process/organization of the module) -and hence wish for it to be considered as such, instead of bleeding into this post.</p>

<p>This post I wanted give a couple proposals for the Adventure Arc (admittedly, this is under the assumption of the above post).</p>

<p>First off, I'd refer everyone to this site:</p>

<p><a href="forum_.html" title="/forum">/forum</a></p>

<p>It details an adventue idea -that could either be part of one or stretched out for all three.</p>

<p>The thread is less then one page, so its not too long of a read.</p>

<p>I have another idea, but I'll wait to post after the thread has some other responses.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I think that this is a great idea, and I have even opened one of those threads you mentioned yesterday (about wanting to join games). </p>

<p>I don't think PS is too difficult to understand; I think I've more or less got the hang of it just by reading different books and materials. My main problem is finding an actual DM to run these games, which is why I came to these forums in the first place... but even here there seems to be a lack of games (or at least games that need players).</p>

<p>In any case, if you do create an Introductory Adventure for PS, I'll make sure that I play it (providing that I actually manage to find a DM+group).</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Dialexis - I agree with you for the most part, where it to apply to the larger adventures. I'm personally rather partial to starting out as close to level 1 as possible, and adventures below level 10 shouldn't require as much trouble as having a group meeting every step of the way. In my opinion, one or two authors will prevent tripipng each other up and playetests/critiques at the later stage will accomplish the same as any large discussion beforehand.</p>

<p>EDIT: Oh, and to Clueless: If this actually get's rolling, would it be possible to set up a seperate forum section specifically for the discussion and critique of adventures under construction?</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Iavas,</p>

<p>Thank you for the reply.  </p>

<p>To reiterate my earlier statement -how do you feel about doing a three-module campaign arc?</p>

<p>(Each can still be relatively short).</p>

<p>And I think we actually agree on only having 1-2 persons working on each module "full-time" -but it would most certainly extra input in regards to artwork, tech support, and it would not hurt to make it a group effort along the way (such as handing out tasks to type up stats or formatting, editing -which would greatly reduce the work load of the "full-timers").</p>

<p>I also think that it is important that the adventure have some degree of input at the beginning -something that a consensus could say we agree on -especially since this is supposed to be Planewalker's attempt to incorporate themselves into new gaming circles.</p>

<p>I also think that it would be nice to slightly develop a new area, and that such should have some input as a group.</p>

<p>The references to the Holy/Peace War are apt -part of their problem is that their is no one leader/manager of the project (versus just too many hands in the pot, it is just no one head chef, proverbably speaking).</p>

<p>Also, part of the problem with starting at first level means that the Players can't choose Tiefling, Modron, Bladelings, Chaond, etc -all being such a huge portion of Planescape and their appeal to Players.  </p>

<p>I think we should start as low as possible, but still high enough to allow minor Planar LA races -which means 3rd or 4th level.</p>

<p>Also, did anyone take a look at my link?</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>A three module campaign arc would be possible, if somewhat more complicated (in terms of planning and coordinating) than a simple module. I agree with you that good leadership is essential.</p>

<p>As for 1st level, I realize that starting at level one is nearly impossible, especially with the numerous ECL's in Planescape. What I mean to say is that starting with lower level adventures such as lvls3-5 would not only be easier, but also make more sense. Even in Planescape, not every adventure must make the heroes save the multiverse from imminent destruction. Sometimes, a simple rescue mission for a moderately important person is about as exciting as it gets.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>All right, I <span style="font-style:italic">really</span> don't like the idea of an "introductory" adventure starting any higher than third level. Too much complexity, ooh, I've got an idea that's in keeping with Dialexis' three part theory (I personally can't stand the rule of three, but it is a good design concept):</p>

<p>Levels 1-2: <span style="font-weight:bold">Welcome to Sigil!</span> Prime characters somehow get to the City of Doors, and have to figure out what to do once they get there. This will probably involve them getting sent to the Cage by some Prime on some quest to retrieve a McGuffin or find some person or something like that. They go through a lot of hoops (and fights with the locals) before they finaly find a lead.</p>

<p>Levels 3-4: <span style="font-weight:bold">Welcome to (a) Hell!</span> After beating up some goons of a mysterious Big Bad, the primes (or Planars who skipped the first adventure) find a portal to somewhere (probably one of the more survivable Lower Planes like Acheron or Pandemonium) and go there to look for clues. After combat with the natives, they break into the base of one of the Big Bad's minions and, after fighting him, they finally learn the identity of the shadowy figure who holds the precious McGuffin and return to Sigil to hunt him down.</p>

<p>Levels 5-6: <span style="font-weight:bold">Back so soon?</span> Players search Sigil for the mysterious big bad, and eventually find him, fight through his goons, and have a climactic confrontation with him. Even though they beat him and stop his evil, they fail to achieve whatever goal they set out for, which gives DM's a ready-made excuse to stay in the planes once the arc is over.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Note that on the Inner Planes, we you think in Fours rather than threes. To propose something, a good "ending" to the introductory adventure(s) would be a section of potential plot hooks and encounters for an adventure in the Inner Planes. They're an important part of the Planescape deal, and it's fitting that they're given a little chance to shine.</p>

<p>Note that some of the more hostile/odd inner planes could make great "We aren't in Kansas anymore" moments for the [Welcome to (a) Hell!] bit - how about a stronghold on the Quasielemental Plane of Ash?</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Iavas,</p>

<p>From your last post, it seems we are in complete agreement (which is nice -and constructive).  Is there any disension on such from any of the others? (Specifically, I'm interested in Rhys' comments, as *she* is the OP).</p>

<p>Duckluck, </p>

<p>I am fine with the adventure arc beginning at 3rd level.</p>

<p>One issue I think we need to address is the nature of the "introduction".</p>

<p>In other words, is it supposed to be a module for the Planescape Setting, which specifically will be of use to DM's relatively new to the setting (i.e. with only the 3.5 PSCS @ Planewalker).</p>

<p>Or, </p>

<p>Is it supposed to be a module that introduces the Planescape Setting (i.e. Sigil &amp; Factions) to a campaign -"in-character" -(i.e. the transition from Clueless Prime to Sigil Cutter).</p>

<p>I personally would advocate the former.</p>

<p>IMO, it allows the greater flexibility, and thus utility, for a DM; specifically, a DM could run the adventure all with Clueless PCs, long-time Sigil PCs, or a mix -whereas the other only allows Clueless PCs.</p>

<p>I think this is important becuse if I was wanting to newly join a Planescape game and created a Prime Clueless PC, only then to figure out all the great mechanical options in the PSCS, I would not be too pleased (i.e. Faction feats and those races are a major source of enjoyment for me personally in playing in the PS setting).</p>

<p>OF,</p>

<p>Yep, Inner Planes definately needs to be part of the Adventure Arc.</p>

<p>Ok, I have a proposal for the arc, but I'll finish typing it up and sending it in a later post -but of course, would love some feedback from the group.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

          Planescape Introductory Adventure        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>I'm slightly torn. I think we should gear the adventure toward levels that allow for ECL 2+ races. How can it be Planescape if we don't facilitate tieflings? At the same time, it might be nice to really show that Planescape lets you be a planewalker from level <span style="font-style:italic">1</span>, not just "pretty low levels." I really wouldn't go higher than ECL 3 at the most. We want this to be a gaming group's first foray into Planescape, so there should be as much room to explore from there as we can possibly fit.</p>

<p>I'm more in favor of Dialexis's former suggestion, the module which introduces the mechanics of Planescape along with the concepts. Making it a strictly "Clueless Primes get dropped into the planes and hope to make it back to the Cage alive" scenario robs the players, like Dialexis pointed out, of the fun of playing with the Planescape rules.</p>

<p>I think that by encouraging use of the PSCS races and feats, we promote the site's conversion as well as the campaign setting itself. I think that by tying it into Planewalker's primary source of gaming rules, it will help to give DMs and players a sense of centrality. "When you're ready to find out more about Planescape, the answers are right here."</p>

<p>So, I think the best thing to do for the adventuring party in this adventure is to produce ~10 PCs, including a few Primes, who can be picked from by players who are new to Planescape and find the task of making an authentically planar character daunting. But you could certainly make whatever character your DM allows if you want. For the pre-generated characters, we can make occasional references in the adventure to certain things which might happen if certain characters are around (e.g. "PCs who come from Bedlam, including Urai the tiefling fighter, benefit from their first-hand knowledge, and gain a +5 competence bonus on the Gather Information check to locate the shady merchant.")</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>My proposed first adventure was really for players who were fairly new to D&amp;D in general. New players really need to start at level 1, and probably shouldn't play anything too complicated. Besides, a player who knows nothing about Planescape really needs to play a Clueless, anyway. </p>

<p>Players who were more more experienced with the game might skip straight to the second adventure, where they can freely play more complex races.</p>

<p>Veteran Planewalkers may even skip straight to the third one, which would have a total "Planescape" feel.</p>

<p>The three modules would have sort of a "Beginner, Intermedate, Advanced" progression to them that I personally think is a very good idea.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><span style="text-decoration:underline">2nd module:</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Adventure Background:</span> Carnot and Taixu (still in guise as loyal assistant, Japhy Gadar) have discovered the existence of the Apocalypse Engine.  However, the details on its use, manufacture, and perhaps most pressing –its location are obscured from the havoc of the Faction War and its aftermath.  </p>

<p>To find these answers, Carnot and Taixu begin abducting veteran members of the two factions involved in its creation.  Initially, they begin by abducting the Doomguards resident in Sigil.  Initially, most residents of Sigil think nothing of the disappearances as the Doomguard are not well liked among the greater populace.  And even when a few Doomguards wind up dead, most citizens merely dismiss the issue as being just another manifestation of the sects fighting amongst themselves and off’ing the rivals.  </p>

<p>(The truth is that Taixu has persuaded a Babau and his Dretch henchmen to act as his kidnappers, but sometimes they get a little sloppy in following orders).  </p>

<p>However, canny cutters tend to take a much closer look when a number of the Dustmen go missing.  </p>

<p>To make matters worse, the unlikely pair have allied with Iunne, the Twice-Fallen Asura Dustmen Factotum.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Adventure Synopsis: </span> Recommended by the Dragoness as problem solvers, they are hired by a Factotum of the Dustmen to solve the riddle (as doing so themselves might require too much “passion”).</p>

<p>The PCs can search around the residences of the slain Doomguard (and have a random encounter with a Doomquard thinking them to be members of the rival sect, sent to kill them).  PCs might find several clues along the way to lead them to believe that the kidnapping and murders are the result of demons.  </p>

<p>Canny (as well as cautious and well paying) PCs might investigate several ways to discover that the Babau was hired by another of the Factotum of the Dustmen –who is partially allied with Taixu, hoping that the Apocalypse Engine could be retrieved and put to use for his Faction (but knows that it is in the hands of the Doomguard, though this later part would not be obvious).</p>

<p>Otherwise, the PCs could try to stage an ambush at the Mortuary, and possibly trap the Babau –who will likewise tell who its employer is if let go (the Dretches can’t relate anything of use).  </p>

<p>If the PCs continue without making any progress, they will eventually be targeted for abduction by Taixu, who will send out the Babau to kidnap the PCs before they uncover too much.  If captured, they can hopefully escape, but regardless, the PCs should eventually link the demons to the Dustman Factotum Iunne.  </p>

<p>Depending on how the PCs confront the Factotum Iunne (who, though allied with the Anarchists, is still a Dustman), they may have to fight him, or may be able to convince him to reveal the location of the holding cells for the kidnapped (which is actually in a cell-headquarters of the Revolutionary League in the first layer of Carceri).  Despite being CN, Iunne will tell the truth if directly questioned as he is still an Asura and impeccably honest.</p>

<p>Obtaining the passage to the portal, the PCs will have to fight off the normal denziens of the Planes, and then infiltrate the Anarchist stronghold, and eventually defeat the half-gehreleth jailor.  Freeing the prisoners, they can find out a few clues about Carnot, and his research into the Apocalypse Engine.  Investigation of the building will reveal Carnot’s study –and although most of the relevant schematics and evidence have already been taken, there is a left note, saying that the Engine has been discovered, and its portal (which is at the old Armory) is nearly complete (Carnot wrote the note for “Gadar” to follow once he returned from another task –which unknown to Carnot was Taixu retrieving the Seed of Renbuu).  They might also locate Carnot’s list of those he needed to “question”.  All are crossed out except for one name –Ylem (This won’t factor in till the next adventure though, but will foreshadow the events to come).</p>

<p>The PCs will need to travel back by the Anarchist's portal to Sigil (perhaps earning the ire or respect of its Faction members).</p>

<p>Technically the PCs could stop here -and if they do, that's OK.</p>

<p>However, they could wish to pursue the mystery further (perhaps hired by the Harmonium to investigate the rumored portal underneath their newly constructed Armory).  Or they could attempt to track down the Iunne (he has since left with Carnot), or the Engine itself.</p>

<p>If they do proceede...</p>

<p>Following the notes, the PCs will follow a secret tunnel route below the newly reconstructed Armory.  Foloowing the directions on Cornat's map, the PCs will discover a strange sight: a group of Rogue Modrons repairing a portal in the ruins of the Old Armory.  The repair work is being supervised by a "mage" -who is actually a shape-changed Green Slaad, and disciple of Taixu.  Although the Armory was all but anihilated during the Faction War and its major portals were all destroyed, Carnot discovered that one of the portals was not beyond repair.  Over time, and with additional magic, he has persuaded a group of rogue Modrons to help repair the malfunctioning portal, specifically, the one leading to the Crumbling Citadel, in the Quasielemental Plane of Ash.</p>

<p>Either through diplomacy, guile, or force, the PCs will need to enter the portal, trying to find this "Japhy and Carnot".</p>

<p>Carnot, through his "questioning" of veteran Doomquard and through Taixu's sources in the Revolutionary League, have discovered that the Apocalypse Engine is located within the ruins of the Crumbling Citadel.  <br />
Inside, the PCs will have to deal with the Plane itself (though mitigated by the failing protective magics of the Faction), the crumbling fortress itself, roaming undead, and ancient faction traps.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, Carnot and Taixu's activities have stirred up a lot of trouble with the Doomguard, and a group of Ashers and Salties arrive at the Citadel shortly after the PCs arrive, causing further chaos and destruction.  However, wise PCs might be able to ally with one of the two sides for aid in seeking the object or Carnot, or at least bypassing the enviromental dangers.</p>

<p>In the end, the PCs should confront Carnot as they reach the Apocalypse Engine.  Depending on how the PCs confront the Rogue Modron, they may be able to find out a lot about their plans, or even be invited to aid their cause.  </p>

<p>However, niether Taixu nor Carnot will allow the PCs to disrupt their plans.  Luckily for the PCs, their main objective is to get the Apocalypse Engine safely out of the Citadel and Plane.  </p>

<p>The end of this adventure is very open (clearly the Modron and the Death Slaad are too powerful for the PCs, but niether are interested in killing the PCs at this time.  However, at this time, they do not wish for their plans to be revealed too soon, and so they will attempt to destroy the entire Crumbling Citadel by activating the Apocalypse Engine (and likely bringing down the roof on both the Ashers and the Salties).  As the item needs to be repaired slightly, Carnot and Taixu will be busy prepping the device.  To stop the PCs from meddling, they will have Iunne hold off the PCs along with some lesser henchmen (maybe undead Dustmen?).  </p>

<p>In the midst of this battle, the Ashers and the Salties will clash (the latter being temporary allies with Taixu).  To make matters worse, the Salties have freed a trapped Rust Dragon.  <br />
As the engine activates, and the Citadel truly begins to disintegrate, the PCs will need to quickly get out of the Plane (either doing so by stepping through Carnot's portal, or through the aid of the Ashers, or by some other means).  However, most of the Doomgaurd will not be so lucky.</p>

<p>In the aftermath, the PCs are sure to have a few questions -and so are others -as the events are sparking the interests of a lot of groups (i.e. not only the Doomgaurd factions wanting to know who was responsible for the destruction of their stronghold, but also the Harmonium interested in the remnant portal below their Armory, as well as the Dustmen in the discovery of their artifact-device.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Rhys,</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply, and I am happy to hear that my previous ideas were well recieved.  I agree with the whole ECL 3 and pregenerated mix of characters.</p>

<p>Ok, here is my idea for the adventure arc (bear in mind, that this is a rough outline for brevity’s sake, as well as being changeable and adaptable to suggestions –especially names –which are really one “place-holders” subject to revision):</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">“Big Picture”:</span></p>

<p>A Death Slaad named Taixu (who is a savant-disciple of Sorel, and thus ultimately Ygorl) has come upon the scheme to increase entropy and social anarchy.  </p>

<p>Specifically, Taixu seeks to bring disorder and revolution within the ranks of the Modron –the greatest of the Exemplars of Law and enemies to Chaos.  In order to accomplish this, Taixu has allied with a most unlikely of allies –a rogue Modron named Carnot.</p>

<p>Before going rogue, Carnot was a Hierarch Modron, one of the Nice Tertians.  As such, it was a judge over the hierarchy, and its reasoning faculty was unsurpassed by all but the Secundi and Primus itself.  Nonetheless, the Modron went rogue after discovering a tract, supposedly being excerpts from a larger text, entitled Fundamental Paradoxes of Equilibrium and Perpetual Motion.  Carnot discovered this text after the Chapterhouse of the Fraternity of Order in Regulus was blown up by a group of Anarchists (secretly instigated by Taixu).</p>

<p>The excerpts –which were placed as to appear to be part of the Fraternity’s library, went on to detail the laws of thermodynamics, as well as seeming to relate how perpetual motion devices were scientifically impossible, since the violated the former.  This treatise was supposedly the work of one Carnot.  As the Tertian presided over the investigation and the trials of those members of the Revolutionary League responsible for the terrorist act, the Modron Hierarch began to read the treatise.  And although the trials proceeding swiftly and efficiently as would be expected, the Modron came to a most shocking of all conclusions: the Modrons were breaking the Law.</p>

<p>And not just one or even a faction of the Modrons, but the Tertian became convinced that the entire race and hierarchy was guilty.  Accepting the proposed axioms of the treatise, it considered the Modron Energy Pool –and upon intense consideration, concluded that such was a perpetual motion machine –and thus in violation of the Laws of Thermodynamics.  </p>

<p>Presiding upon its own court, it attempted to sentence the entire race –Primus included.  However, such a breach of authority was not permitted by the One and Prime, and so it was the Tertian instead that was tried by its peers, and when its heresy was discovered, it was declared a rogue, stripped of its power and station, and exiled.</p>

<p>Like most rogue Modrons, it would have never recalled these events had it not encountered a “traveler” calling himself Japhy Gadar.  Gadar claimed to be a surviving member of the Fraternity’s destroyed Chapterhouse, and relayed the details to the Modron of its former station, as well as revealing it the treatise that led to its fateful conclusion.  Traveling to the Fraternity’s Main Headquarters, the rogue searched for the complete text and for further information on this Carnot.  However, no such treatise was said to exist nor was there any such author in their records.  Talking with Gadar, the Modron came to another strange conclusion –that it in reality was Carnot, as it had accepted the writings as its own and their conclusions and that it would be up to it to complete the text.  </p>

<p>However, little did this newly-named Carnot realize that its companion Japhy Gadar was in reality Taixu the Death Slaadi –who had all along written the tract and was responsible for the destruction of the Fraternity’s chapterhouse and the planting of the seditious document.  </p>

<p>Thus, Carnot “convinced” Japhy Gadar of its cause –to bring judgement to the Modron Hierarchy and to rectify its misalignments with the Law as Carnot perceived it.  Studying and traveling together, the two eventually came across a plan.</p>

<p>Their plan would require two main components.  One was an artifact called the Seed of Renbuu –supposedly, an egg pellet produces by the Lord of Colors himself, and said to have great powers over Change and Transformation.</p>

<p>The other item was something referred to as the Apocalypse Engine, an invention of artifice and magic supposedly created by a secret joint venture between the Doomguard and the Dustmen just before the Faction War.  This device was reported to create a field of suspended negative and entropic energies, that when combined might facilitate the pursuit of True Death and the Heat Death of the Multiverse.</p>

<p>But despite their seeming alliance, Taixu has different plans.  Instead of merely attempting to drain the Modron Energy Pool as Carnot intends (which Taixu realizes would be impossible to bypass all the Modrons defending it –not even including Primus), the Death Slaad instead plans on waiting till Carnot resets the Apocalypse Engine, and then plans on embedding Carnot with the Seed of Renbuu.  Doing so, along with other experiments, he predicts this will cause Carnot to return to his rank of Tertian, causing chaos within the Hierarchy.  However, the true Anarchy will begin once, the lower units respond to conflicting commands from the Hierachs, which coupled with the Seed’s influence will cause many to go Rogue.  However, their absence will be catastrophic since they will not be able to be replaced, as the Apocalypse Engine will prohibit the Modron Energy Pool from recycling and promoting others, without leaving absences further down the hierarchy.  As the gaps in the hierarchy increases, the anarchy will only further increase as the lower units will be unable to perceive the chain of the command and go rogue.  With so many rogue units, Taixu plans to flame the fires of civil war between the units, and each death further draining the Pool, and causing mass Anarchy and Entropy within the Hierarchy.  Although the Slaad entertains the optimistic possibility that such might bring down the entire race, Taixu more realistically projects that the Engine and the Rogues will be destroyed, but not before its actions cause significant Chaos, and weaken Law.</p>

<p>By the end of the Adventure Arc, the PCs will have to face this pair and their plan.  In the end, the PCs will have the option of aiding or attempt to stop this plot –but the choice will ultimately be theirs.  As is the case with all great Planescape Adventures, there is no one “right” way, nor is any situation black and white.</p>

<p>Ok, that said, this meta-plot will not become obvious to the PCs until the third adventure –though canny PCs might notice the foreshadowing clues and threads throughout the entire set of modules.</p>

<p>Here is a basic outline of the three adventures of the Arc:</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">1st module: </span> </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Adventure Background:</span>  The PCs are hired by the proprietor of the Fortune’s Wheel in Sigil.  A member of the Ring-Givers, she appears to be a female gnome, but in reality is a Copper Dragon.  She claims that her “most beloved treasures” were stolen from her, and she hires the PCs to return them to her.  What she does not, at first, tell the PCs is that this treasure is her recently laid batch of Copper Dragon Eggs.</p>

<p>The eggs were stolen as part of a nefarious plot being carried out by an aspirant member of the Sodkillers, one Visravas, a sorcerer of some skill and devious manipulator.  Though he often takes the guise of a human, such is an illusion –he is actually a Rakshasa from Archeron, who hopes that by gaining greater political pull within the Faction, he will be able to increase his personal power relative to his rival Rakshasas.  </p>

<p>His plan is to use the Seed of Renbuu (which he recently obtained through other nefarious means) to transform the Copper Dragon eggs to Green Dragon Eggs, from which he plans to raise the Dragons as his own personal servants, loyal to him, but indoctrinated in the Sodkillers.  Once of able age, he plans on presenting them to the Sodkillers, thinking that with their aid, the Faction might be able to finalize and legitimize their bid for control over Law Enforcement within the City of Doors.  </p>

<p>Of course, it happened to also give him delicious satisfaction that his gain would come at the expense of the jovial dragon, who had long been a thorn in his side.  </p>

<p>Visravas, through his Faction connections, hired several group of mercenaries from the Minder’s Guild to “acquire” the eggs and safely transport them to the Rakshasa’s residence in Archeron.  </p>

<p>Ironically, Visravas tricked the hired hands, telling them that the eggs were to be confiscated as part of the trade laws, as they had been “brought” into the city without proper payment of tax and tariffs on the importation of live creatures.  However, upon “discrete confiscation” of the eggs, they delivered the eggs to another set of hired mercenaries (who had been hired to “kill the thieves and confiscate their stolen goods”).</p>

<p>However, this second group of mercenaries soon had to flee the murder scene (their actions being tipped off by none other than Visravas himself).  They then received a message from their employer, who told them that all they had to do was to deliver the eggs to Archeron and then they would receive their payment which would include “all their legal problems being taken care of” (which was true in a twisted way, since Visravas planned on imprisoning the mercenaries himself and turning them in for the reward back in Sigil –though killed before they could speak of the Rakshasa’s involvement).  <br />
And while the desperate mercenaries from the Minder’s Guild traveled to Archeron, Visravas imprisoned the mercenaries –waiting to kill them only after authenticating the delivery of the eggs.</p>

<p>However, several of the mercenaries escaped –and while one was killed, and another was enslaved by a roving band of goblin petitioners, the other two escaped Archeron –one attempting to hide out in Elysium, while the other traveled back to Sigil, hoping to clear his name.  In doing so, he discovered the link back to the Dragoness owner of the gambling house and sought to earn her protection for his information.</p>

<p>But upon learning of the mercenaries’ escape, the Rakshasa manipulates a Zelekhut Inevitable to track them down and “bring to justice those runaway murderers”.  </p>

<p>And so, just before the gnome-appearing Dragoness can talk with the mercenary who shows up in her gambling house, the Zelekhut strikes, along with a small group of bladeling assassins as extra-muscle –intent on bringing the mercenary back –dead or alive (the bladelings prefer dead).  </p>

<p>Enter the PCs.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Adventure Synopsis:</span> the PCs are in the Fortune’s Wheel, when the Inevitable and the Bladelings attack.  Presumably defending themselves, they are unable to save the runaway mercenary (If by some stroke of luck, they can repel the Inevitable and save the mercenary, then they can skip the next part).  However, seeing them acquit themselves in battle, the Dragoness proprietress hires the group to recover her “treasure” –promising a handsome reward –in money or other services as she can offer.  </p>

<p>The PCs have two main clues –if they ask around and search in Sigil they will discover that the killed mercenary was part of a group of wanted murderers –and might learn the names and descriptions of the other members of the group.  The other clue is an address written on a scrap of parchment that has a name of one of the mercenaries (the one who fled to Elysium).</p>

<p>Putting the two clues together, the PCs should then travel to Elysium to find the mercenary.  Upon the way, the PCs will come across a small gang of Slaadi (Taixu’s minions).  Canny and fast-talking PCs might garner some more clues or even strike a temporary alliance with the Slaadi, or might end up in a brawl with the chaos-exemplars.</p>

<p>However, upon reaching the address, they will find that the mercenary has just been abducted by the Inevitable.  </p>

<p>PCs may either attempt to follow the Zelekhut’s tracks, or they may discover a wounded Musteval Guardinal at the site of the abduction.  If they heal the celestial, it will tell them that in atonement, the mercenary was attempting start a mission to save the life of his once ally enslaved by the Archeron goblins –and thus the PCs could attempt to finish said quest to obtain the location of Visravas and the eggs.</p>

<p>Either way, the PCs travel to Archeron (hopefully through portals), and then must attempt to free the badly beaten mercenary from a goblin fortress (and hopefully use the timing of an orc attack to cover their escape and break-in).  Here they will also discover that the “treasure” is a batch of Dragon Eggs.</p>

<p>From there, the PCs will travel to Visravas’s lair, fight past his Maug bodyguards and traps.  The climax of the adventure takes place in the laboratory, where Visravas is about to begin the transformation with the Seed of Renbuu.  </p>

<p>The PCs will battle against the now-revealed Rakshasa, who vigorously guards the eggs.  However, the battle will be interrupted by Taixu himself, who appears and takes the Seed of Renbuu.  Depending on how the PCs interacted with his minions in Elysium, he may even aid the PCs in battling the Rakshasa. </p>

<p>Either way, the PCs hopefully are able to obtain the eggs and return them to their mother, who richly rewards them as promised.  If the Rakshasa survived, then he will plot their downfall (i.e. a future side-bar inclusion), regardless, they have made themselves enemies among the Sodkillers, but perhaps several allies as well (especially if the Rakshasa’s true plans and involvement are discovered).</p>

<p>Ok, I have rough ideas for the last two modules, but will wait to post since this post is insanely large as it is.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

          Planescape Introductory Adventure        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>I like the idea. Here's some problems I see in it (don't take this personally, just trying to apply some constructive criticism):</p>

<p>¤) I see many relatively touch creatures, some of which the PC's even have to face in battle, if not necessarily defeat. On the other hand, there do not seem to be that many enemies that the PC's, given a level 3-5, could stand a chance of defeating without help. I realize that this is, after all, Planescape, and your wits should get you farther than your sword arm, but battles still obviously arise and having the main enemy either run away, ignore you, or be defeated with the help of a similarly powerful ally gets old really fast. Even the Babau, which is CR6 without class levels, is dangerously powerful, especially with minions. This is assuming that the main villain, the Death Slaad (the fact that death slaad should be around CR20 in my opinion I'll leave for another time) is one of those behind-the-scenes villains that you shouldn't actually face in battle until well into your teens.</p>

<p>¤) For a single adventure, there are very many individuals who are not what they seem to be. The slaad, the dragon, the Rakshasa, the Anarchist Factotum, etc. It might get a little too confusing for a first run through.</p>

<p>¤) The chaos of the slaad should be toned up, so as to give the whole chaos-vs-law theme more atmosphere.</p>

<p>Aside from the last point, the criticism mostly falls on the fact that this should be a relatively low level introductory adventure. However, aside from that, it seems very well written and thought through.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Am I the only one whose head is swimming after all this?</p>

<p>Dialexis, your idea isn't a bad idea - but it seems far too complicated to work well for an adventure that's supposed to be run straight out of the box. There's at least four concealed plans and secret identities - and it really takes a good planescape DM to take these characters and make them true to all of said identities.</p>

<p>Then, there's the whole thing with Copper&gt;Green Dragons - I don't really see the logic. This is Planescape, not Faerun - if you can have a LN Eladrin, it seems a simple matter just to raise them the right way [rather than as Violent Green dragons which don't care to take orders].</p>

<p>I'd rather keep it fairly simple - as per DL's proposition - [Sigil, another Plane or Two, back]. There's no need for more than one villan or a secret benefactor.</p>

<p>While a Slaad villian is an interesting idea, they are by definition Chaotic - he seems to have his head a little too tightly screwed on his shoulders for a Death Slaad [which are even *more* insane than most Slaad, being tainted with strange evil and all that.]</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Iavas,</p>

<p>Your point is well-taken.  However, let me try to illustrate how I have already incorporated such concepts into the design.</p>

<p>Take the first adventure.  Standard group of PCs, level 3.</p>

<p>The first adventure includes the Zelekhut busting in and attempting to take out the mercenary.  The CR 7 Inevitable is not going to be really fighting the PCs.  (Though there may be some interaction, as well as foreshadowing a big battle).  </p>

<p>However, the PCs are going to be battling the Bladeling mercs -and at a CR 1 each, you can throw a small gang, and have the party statistically do very well against these foes.  </p>

<p>So, looking at a real EL or 3 -right on the money, maybe even lower really.</p>

<p>The next round is more investigative -as well as perhaps having some "random" encounter -such as when the ask around and might have to deal with some sinker thugs (foreshadowing) trying to mess with a Fraternity lawyer (who could be a lead as to the list of wanted mercenaries) -this would also be another low EL (2-3?).  This latter is just an example -one of the ways, we all can add our own touches.  Despite the length, my proposal is still an overview.</p>

<p>Traveleing to Elysium (which should not be too dangerous at all), the PCs encounter a Red Slaadi (CR 6) and maybe a Chaond Bard (who mostly is about illusions I think -or some other equivalent thing -we can decide details letter if we choose to go this route).  Such an encounter is an EL 6, or maybe 7 (which is certainly within the DMG standard -its a very challenging encounter, but not one that has to end in violence, and if it does, and it does not need to be to the death -i.e. the Chaond and Slaadi have no need to kill the PCs.  Moreover, they would/could be Celestials coming out of the woodwork to help or heal or aid at the end -but regardless, EL 6-7 isn't unrealistic, especially since the positive healing of the plane benefits the PCs far more since the Red already has some).</p>

<p>The next set (meaning there are opportunities to expand if desired) of encounters would be in Archeron.  </p>

<p>Not only can you throw some minor EL challenges their way (maybe a Gauth slaver? =EL 6), their next "scheduled one" would be the strike on the goblin outpost.  Goblin petitioners are low-CR combatants -and so by this time the PCs are most likely ECL 4, and so can more than take on a bunch of them, even if lead by a say a 4th level Blue, or a Bugbear, with some henchmen -i.e. more like a dungeon crawl, since the PCs should not be stupid enough to fight all its goblins at once.  Not to mention the really canny should benefit from the timing of the orc raid, at the end -who even then are low individual CR's).</p>

<p>And though Visravas's manor could take many forms -he is busy with the transformation, and thus must rely upon his guards and magic traps in place (imagine things like LE topiary guardians -low CR, and CR 3 traps, and such).  Maugs are tough, but still within CR range -these would be his elite units, the more common toughs being NPCs or 1-2 levels.  <br />
All together, a series of EL 3-6 encounters -which is standard for the adventures.</p>

<p>The final "boss" fight with the Rakshasa is definately the toughest.  However, by himself he is a CR /EL 7.  Standard rules usually set the BBEG at being PC average level +4 (which by this time would be EL <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/cool.png" title="Cool" alt="Cool" class="smiley-content"/>.  So, we could even through in a pair of melee guards.  Or, if we feel (as I do) that Rakshasas are very "high" CR 7's, we can leave him alone in the chamber.</p>

<p>This doesn't inlcude the PCs might gain aid from Taixu (though the ending proscribed really has the PCs beating on their own).  Also, remember that the PCs don't have to kill the Rakshasa in order to win -all they have to do is get the eggs.  </p>

<p>The end can resolve in a number of ways -but even if it is a straight fight between BBEG vs. PCs -the EL is way within the limits.</p>

<p>2nd module:</p>

<p>As you said, many encounters can be bypassed by saavy PCs, but more militant PCs are just fine too.</p>

<p>For instance -checking out the scenes and fighting some Salties or paranoid Ashers in Sigil could have a nice EL of 5 (maybe a 3rd level Sinker and/or a Minotaur Sinker).  Since the party is 5th level by now, this isn't a huge EL at all.</p>

<p>Depending on how the PCs continue the search -they could end up facing a CR 6 Babau with 2 CR 2 Dretch lackeys -for a total of EL 7 -a tough fight, but too high since the PCs are a ECL 5 by now.  And this battle is made even easier if they PCs have picked up on clues as to the nature of the culprits.  Of course along their way, they might have more random clues (consider a summoned rast by a bitter wizard at the death of the Rakshasas among the Sodkillers just to spice things up -or something similar.</p>

<p>Fighting (or talking) to the Factotum in league with Carnot, should be a CR 7 -(I am actually thinking of switching it to have this Factotum be Iunne the CN Dustmen Asura -which would be perfect with the Plane of Ash final encounter as well as the spilling of the beans by telling the truth, and in CR level).</p>

<p>PCs traveling to the Carceri, should overtly face any Demodands/Gerheleths, but may face a pack of CR 3 Howlers (ECL 6?).  In the Anarchist holding cell, the PCs could either face a couple of CR 1-2 NPCs, in sequence, with the BBEG being a Half-Gerheleth jailor -complete with Quasit familiar!  (This being about a CR 8? EL).  A harder and possibly climax fight if the PCs don't continue on the the Crumbling Citadel.</p>

<p>If they do continue, they will probably be at least 6th level PCs by now.  They will face (once again all the scenarios don't have to end in fighting -but CAN), a Green Slaadi with a bunch of rogue Modron workers (1 CR 9 with maybe 4 CR 1's -equal EL 9 -which is tough, but definatley on par with 6th ECL PCs).  </p>

<p>Inside the Crumbling Citadel, they would face traps &amp; hazards (EL 2-5?), as well as undead (low-level gangs of zombies and other encounters spiced with higher CR undead -but still ELs of 7 and lower).  </p>

<p>The Asher and Salties can balance each other or be dealt with in small groups of ELs 4-7.  </p>

<p>The final fight with the Apocolypse Engine doesn't include the PCs fighting Carnot or Taixu.  Instead, they must/can fight the Asura once and for all (CR 7) with some back-up thugs -Sinkers adding +1/2 to the EL.   Throw in a small (enough) Rust Dragon, and you have a EL or 9 or 10 (which is in line for the climax battle of the adventures) -and even this is mitigated if the PCs can ally with the Ashers.</p>

<p>Thus, although you may only see the BBEG's listed, if you look closely, you will see that the entire arc proposal stays within the DMG standards of good adventure EL design.</p>

<p>(I do appreciate you bringing up the point though).</p>

<p>As for incognito NPCs -well, this IS Planescape -what else do we expect -where nothing is exactly as it seems -it is one of the halmarks of the game setting.</p>

<p>And granted, the proposal does include elements of mystery, hack-n-slash, role-play, and philosophy all in one.  However, any one of these aspects could be diminished or hieghtened to suit each DMs desires/tastes (as well as the DMing style desired by the Players).</p>

<p>For instance, you don't need to unravel the Rakshasa's true nature to beat him, but if you do you can load up on blessed arrows and such.</p>

<p>All that said -in the first module, only 2 NPCs are actually in disguise -one being an ally and the other the villian.</p>

<p>For a total of like 13 encounters with probably 50? NPCs? that isn't too many.</p>

<p>Also, the two may conceal their physical identities behind magic, but they are who they say they are -instead of acting incognito too.</p>

<p>As for the second adventure -the only disguised persona is Taixu as Japhy Gadar.  Iunne the Dustmen -allied with the Anarchist is not disguised at all -in fact as an Asura, any direct question will get a completely honset answer.  There may be a duality of loyalty, but not a disguise per sae.</p>

<p>As for toning up the Chaos of Taixu -I have been brief in his personality; however, consider this -he isn't really evil (which makes him a more interesting Planescapy foe -or ally).  </p>

<p>Something that makes a lot of people sick is how Slaad are often ALL portrayed as lunatic morons.  A Death Slaadi is wise and intelligent -and should be able to be such in-game too.  </p>

<p>Let me know how you would like for him to be more chaotic (but if you tell me to have him sing backwards and ride a unicycle, then I'll take a dim view).</p>

<p>Consider his actions -he is trying to bring about anarchy, and social/political revolution, at the same time bringing about Entropy as well.  He has warped a Modron, and assumes changing personas and aliases (as any good Anarchist does).  </p>

<p>The only thing he does in the 1st adventure is to send a pair of Slaad-kin to find a merc (and could be plenty random enough in Elysium) and then at the end, pop in and grab some seemingly unrelated item -and probably causes all kinds of chaos in the labratory before he leaves.</p>

<p>The second adventure shows how he is causing all kinds of strife between factions (divisions and paranoia between the Sinkers, infiltrating the Dustmen, etc).  He uses and abandons all kinds of minions/dupes (demons, Asuras, Sinkers, and Modrons and Slaadi).  </p>

<p>The somewhat Lawful bent of the Apocalypse Engine retrevial is due to the influence of Carnot, who systematically goes about his research (but becomes messy due to Taixu's influence).</p>

<p>And in the end, wait till the third and final adventure, when all his chaotic-ness is revealed in its full glory.</p>

<p>(Oh, and I agree about the Death Slaad CR, but what can we do?  If we prefer, we could make him a Gray, on the cusp of becoming a Black?)</p>

<p>OF, consider that I just downloaded a whole lot of information in a rapid blitz summary.  It really isn't that much more complex than your standard three-part module currently published.</p>

<p>As for the false identies, see my comments above to Iavas.</p>

<p>As for the Copper to Green -it is to illustrate the Power of the Seed of Renbuu -the change of colors and spirit.  (Not only changing color, but from Elements -Green (Air) from Copper(Earth) -as well as CG to LE -there is also a persona as well.</p>

<p>The concept is important to the meta-plot and should be a whoa-cool factors for the PCs.</p>

<p>As for all Slaad being insane -refer to earlier comments (they may seem insane to you, but their choices have validity, not innocence through insanity).  Look at what he does and how he does it, and his final goal, and you can see how Taixu is C(E).</p>

<p>But I'll repeat, Slaadi are not demon-lite.</p>

<p>Ok, thanks for all the feedback.  This is just a proposal and want it to be a team decision -regardless of which idea is selected.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Well defended! Well defended indeed!  <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/lol.png" title="Laughing out loud" alt="Laughing out loud" class="smiley-content"/> </p>

<p>I'm no longer too worried about ECL. I was never that good at counting all that up anyway, so it was a half-hearted point at best. </p>

<p>I'm still a bit concerned about the identity confusion. Even though this is Planescape, it should be easy on newer players who might not be used to figuring out the identity behind every other villain. The death slaad villain should obviously remain disguised, as should the vice-villain Rakshasa. You kind of can't bypass the dragon being disguised, unless it's located somewhere other than Sigil. In my opinion, those three are about as much intrigue as the average initiate should be expected to handle. I might be wrong, though. That can be decided upon later in the playtesting phase.</p>

<p>I'm not sure what you mean exactly by having it be a grey slaad about to become black. I'm not to fond of the Epic Level Handbook, and I was pretty sure that both white and black slaadi were originally slaad lords. What I meant about the CR was more along the lines of redoing slaad stats in a way that stretches them from low to high level, rather than grouping them up in the middle. Sort of like some people have done or are planning on doing with the yugoloths.</p>

<p>What I meant about playing up the chaos is definately not raving madness. These are intelligent creatures, at least the high ups like the death slaad, so they should not act stupid in randomness. They should just not be predictable. Maybe have a few times where the PC's have the possibility to unravel one of the villain's plans only to discover that he has changed them on a whim. So maybe they discover something that says that he'll be doing something at a certain place at a certain time only to find that only a few of the slower minions are there, looking as confused as anybody, while the main force is off somewhere else on a last-minute change of plans.</p>

<p>Finally, I really like the idea of Ygorl's egg pellets being able to change the color and essence of various creatures. That can really go places. Kudos.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Ok, I have an idea.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">beginning:</span> Our happy PCs arrive in sigil, take a look around and settle down getting a kip to live in. <br />
           The kip that our PCs make their home in has a really big mirror in it attached to the wall. Once the PCs are all together and no one else is listening, a face appears on the mirror and speaks to them. The mirror has been waiting for new persons to occupy the kip, and your PCs just happen to be the lucky people.  The face in question is one of the higher ranking doomguard from Citadul Cavitius (Ash), whose section is all about slowing entropy in the multiverse.  He talks to the PCs and convinces them to join the Doomguard Faction, detailing that the doomguard of the salt citadel want to speed up entropy as fast as possible, and that help would much be liked in countering these. <br />
        Soon after the PCs join the Doomguard, the doomguard pay for a genie exploratory vessel to pick the PCs up and take them to the Ash citadel. There they are given (nonmagical) rings with the doomguard symbol on them to signify them as faction members. Before getting into the business of halting the salties, the Doomguard give the PCs a rare portal creating device (which is consumed when used to create a portal) which creates a permanent two-way portal between where the operator of the device is and to a specific place in a plane the operator desires(must have been there before), with which portal keys can be assigned. They are sent back to sigil via the genie vessel and are told to create a portal in some abandoned building or undersigil or whatever to the citadel with the portal key as the rings in the place (clearing out any pests first;)), so they can recruit more people to their cause.  As soon as this is done, doomguards come through the portal and start building and patching the place up. The doomguard will then begin recruiting people (In secret), and start selling items to the people of sigil to make a profit. </p>

<p>After that it gets more interesting, though this is where the DM comes up with his own stuff for a couple of levels. This is where the doomguard sends the PCs off to stop the salties plans (attacking people) and giving the doomguard a bad name across the planes. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">levels 6 and 7 maybe:</span> After greatly hindering the salties, the PCs take a break from them. The doomguard send them to the quasielemental plane of thorns ((negative energy-plane of wood)and what i hope to be in chapter 8 of PLSC), with other doomguard, to start the building process of another citadul. The plane of thorns is the rumoured origin of razorvine, and the doomguard want to do some research into its nature (potentially helping the people of sigil), and maybe make other things on the plane of thorns.  Once done, a portal is made from the citadul to the ash citadul, which the PCs travel through, and are given another portal device,  with which they are to go through the portal to sigil and create another portal to the thorn citadul in the same building. The thorn citadul will be able to accomodate the newly growing members of the doomguard as well as study the plane of thorns. A new doomlord will have to be assigned to the citadul. </p>

<p>Building the citadul will involve staying on the plane of thorns for many months, slaying those native to the plane if they are hostile towards the doomguard, and generally making sure the building procedure happens on schedule. Hey, this be the first time PCs have helped build a building!<img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/lol.png" title="Laughing out loud" alt="Laughing out loud" class="smiley-content"/><br />
Lets say the PCs gain 1 level for entering the plane of thorns and traversing through the plane with all the other doomguard far enough into the plane and into a place where building looks good.(lots of natives to the plane will attack the doomguard). And 1 more level for helping build the citadul. </p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">level 9:</span> This is where i really like it. On each elemental plane Good and Evil archomentals are battling for control of their specific planes. The doomguards have learned, to their horror, that good on ever single elemental plane (Not including the wood ones), is slowly, but surely losing. First they witnessed this in the plane of ash, and upon contact with the voids and dusters the same thing was happening. So dispatched through the plane they went, and learned the same thing for every elemental plane. What this would mean for the multiverse if all the elemental planes turned evil is unthinkable.  Each good archomental has fallen into a deep coma. The doomguards don't know what evil caused it, but are certain that it was from outside work.  What they do know, however, is that there are cures to bring each of these archomentals back into conciousness. That is where the PCs come in. The PCs have to get these cures and go to every elemental plane. This will take quite a few sessions;)</p>

<p>Most important to note is this: Each cure for the archomental on a specific plane is found on the opposing plane that the archomental resides on. The PCs will be told what to get.</p>

<p>For example:<br />
The water archomental can only be cured by a rare plant that grows on the islands of rock in the paraelemental plane of magma. The reason it's rare is because of magma(template from denzinens of the inner planes applied) darktentacles (MMII) that dwell around the islands pulling the cutters into the magma. Not that our fellow PCs should know about this monster of course. </p>

<p>The rest of the cures are up to you lot to help with.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">High levels:</span> At higher levels the PCs should find out one way or another who was behind these comas. I personally, am going to use denzinens of the far realm as the ones who did it, but others can use who they want as the greater evil behind this. </p>

<p>The way mine will continue is this: Dieties of the far realm want to bring insanity across the whole multiverse. It would have helped them greatly if the evil of the elemental planes bought untold chaos throughout the multiverse, but alas.</p>

<p>They plan to do this via something I like to call caveway portals. These take time to create, and arent done so lightly. They require a titanic amount of rock to be done. A considerably powerful entity from the far realm must connect with a considerably powerful entity from anywhere other than the far realm (The evil archomentals anyone?) These two entities start to become one with the rock, each on either side creating a titanic tunnel through the rock, until eventually both tunnels connect, making a permanent gateway to either realm. At the front of either side of the tunnel is the entities face (At the top), which can still speak. As one travels through the tunnel one can see all the innards of the entity pulsating along the walls (viens, the heart, etc). It would take considerable power to harm the walls. During the melding process, the entities are powerless, so they will have lots of things there to protect them.</p>

<p>It is my PCs job to stop these forming, or, if any form, to collapse the magically protected tunnels.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Ye, gods, Dialexis! Iavas may have been convinced, but I'm not. Those CR's are all over the place, and mostly too high. Zelekhuts? Rakshasas!? Rust Dragons!?!?!? CR 10!?! :shock: These PC's will be lucky if they are level six by then! Are you crazy?</p>

<p>An EL that is two points higher than the ECL of a party is considered an even match for them (meaning that there's a decent chance a PC will die). This is fine for once a level encounters, but the PCs should never have to contend with it as often as you seem to think they should.  </p>

<p>An EL three levels is acceptible in really important battles, and times when the PC's have a destinct edge, but even then there is a high probability that one or more PCs will die, and if you make them fight through a<span style="font-style:italic"> Dungeon full of traps and monsters</span> to get there there <span style="font-style:italic">will</span> be fatalities. </p>

<p>Lastly, sticking the PCs into an encounter they aren't ultra-prepped for with a monster that is four ELs above them is pretty much always a bad idea, especially when they have already had a number of encounters that day.  For the record, a "Very Difficult" fight is one where there is a<span style="font-style:italic"> very</span> real chance of a total party kill. I wouldn't even make veteran players do that, but in an "introductory" module, it is totally unacceptible. </p>

<p>We're trying to introduce people to the setting, not the joys of making new characters. </p>

<p>Beyond that, I have another complaint. The first module, and probably the second, should be about gradually introducing new players to the planes and showing the DMs how to run low-level encounters on the planes. Instead, you saddle the players (and especially the DM) with an elaborate backstory and complex plot from the get-go, and instead of giving them an adventure suited to new, low level players, you have them in situations (and fighting NPC's) that would be far better suited for mid-level (starting level 5, at least) characters. Retreaving dragon eggs. Finding Doomsday weapons. Rescuing the entire Modron Race! These are not things characters in the 3-7 range should be doing. For that matter, when exactly are you planning on having them fight the Death Slaad?</p>

<p>No offence, but I think these modules will need a major rework if they are to be suitable for new players.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Iavas,</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>I'm no longer too worried about ECL. I was never that good at counting all that up anyway, so it was a half-hearted point at best. </div></p>

<p>Glad to hear it.  And I appreciated the questioning.  A product can only get better as we all try to refine it and check for errors.  Thank you for considering my response in kind.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>I'm still a bit concerned about the identity confusion. Even though this is Planescape, it should be easy on newer players who might not be used to figuring out the identity behind every other villain. The death slaad villain should obviously remain disguised, as should the vice-villain Rakshasa. You kind of can't bypass the dragon being disguised, unless it's located somewhere other than Sigil. In my opinion, those three are about as much intrigue as the average initiate should be expected to handle. I might be wrong, though. That can be decided upon later in the playtesting phase.</div></p>

<p>I actually totally agree with you on that one.  In fact, that was all I was really thinking should be magically incognito.  Rule of Three's strikes again!</p>

<p>And remember that the adventures are written so that you don't have to figure out who they are -but if you do, you've unlocked another level of Planescapey-ness.  </p>

<p>Honestly, if we want to -Visravas doesn't even need to be disguised at all if we want to eliminate that one (although it does help to build his M.O. as a Rakshasa).</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>I'm not sure what you mean exactly by having it be a grey slaad about to become black. I'm not to fond of the Epic Level Handbook, and I was pretty sure that both white and black slaadi were originally slaad lords. What I meant about the CR was more along the lines of redoing slaad stats in a way that stretches them from low to high level, rather than grouping them up in the middle. Sort of like some people have done or are planning on doing with the yugoloths. </div></p>

<p>Oops, typo!  I meant to write "Death" instead of "Black".  Yeah, no ELH Slaad this time...</p>

<p>Hmm, I really do agree with restating the Slaad progression, but I would be apprehensive about doing so for the introductory campaign.  If people want to, I am ok with that (and instead simply make Taixu a Gray instead of Death -it wouldn't change much).   </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>What I meant about playing up the chaos is definately not raving madness. These are intelligent creatures, at least the high ups like the death slaad, so they should not act stupid in randomness. They should just not be predictable. Maybe have a few times where the PC's have the possibility to unravel one of the villain's plans only to discover that he has changed them on a whim. So maybe they discover something that says that he'll be doing something at a certain place at a certain time only to find that only a few of the slower minions are there, looking as confused as anybody, while the main force is off somewhere else on a last-minute change of plans. </div></p>

<p>I see what you are saying -and I can agree to it.  (For instance, the Slaad and Chaond in Elysium in the first Module could have thought they were going to meet Taixu, but he bailed and went to Archeron instead).  </p>

<p>At the same time though -remember that Randomness is not the end-all-be-all of Chaos.  Randomness is typified by the Slaadi Lord Chourst. (and he is not even one of the two main Slaadi Lords).  </p>

<p>For instance -consider the Mad Zen, or the Egoist -each are ammoral and CN, but niether are random in their choices (in essence, randomness would actually nullify the efficacy of their agency).</p>

<p>But anyways, your point is well taken.  Consider this: Just as Taixu's chaoticness has affected the LN Carnot, so too has Carnot's Lawfulness affected the CN(E) Taixu -which helps to explain his less then incomprehensibleness.</p>

<p>Or, if you prefer -consider the analogy of the atom.  Carnot is like the nucleus, stable and centered, where Taixu is like the electron errectically and nearly unpredictabley jumping all around in orbit.  </p>

<p>Duckluck,</p>

<p>Check the Facts.  Reread my post -you are jumping to erroneous conclusions.  There are no multiple Rakshasas -only one -a CR 7 BBEG as the climatic battle, for a group of then 4th-to 5th ECL PCs.  That is completely within the rules and guidelines for D&amp;D (Check the DMG).  For further proof, check and compare the official adventure modules put out -they all have exactly the same standard (you can actually read up on some of the Dungeon magazine standards and they also verify this).  </p>

<p>Look back over my long post and you will see that they don't encounter CR 7 monsters all the time -majority are EL 3-EL 4, with a few lower and a few higher (check DMG for statistical standard and see how it conforms).</p>

<p>And the Rust Dragon isn't a Wyrm -use common sense.  In the very first 3rd Edition module (Sunless Citadel for 1st level characters) they had to take on a White Wyrmling -whose CR was 3.</p>

<p>The Rust Dragon will be be young enough and small enough to be of a CR 7ish age category.  </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>An EL that is two points higher than the ECL of a party is considered an even match for them (meaning that there's a decent chance a PC will die).

<p>Not factual -go back and look at the official rules of the DMG for related percentage of encounters at relative ELs -and likewise compare to official modules of 3.X edition and Dungeon magazine.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>We're trying to introduce people to the setting, not the joys of making new characters.</div> </p>

<p>I agree with this.  Hence the reason why each module is long enough to have the PCs advance along the way (with easy and moderately challenging encounters) and gain opportunities to prepare themselves for the big battles (as well as mitigating circumstances that are nearly always in the PCs favor -i.e. The Armory Portal Battle is tough with the Green Slaad, but after the fight, they can rest as long as they need to, or in the fight with the Rakshasa, they don't actually have to kill him to win, or might recieve aid from Taixu, and/or could turn the Zelekhut against the fiend if they have enough evidence, and the list goes on and on (check my initial post on this issue).</p>

<p>And remember, Rhys has said that this is supposed to be a set of modules that introduces the setting -NOT the game.  In other words, this adventure arc is of use to both new gamers and to veteran gamers.  It is just geared to showcasing the Planescape setting -which I think it does (as its main nemesises are a Rogue Modron and an Anarchist Death Slaadi-savant of Sorel &amp; Ygorl, and each adventure displays a number of Planes (1st shows Sigil, Elysium, and Archeron -2nd shows other parts of Sigil, Carceri, and the Plane of Ash, and wait for the 3rd, but it will probably showcase parts of the Positive Quasielemental Planes, Arcadia, Mechanus, and maybe Pandemonium) -each case, I specifically chose sites that are uncommon in normal setting (i.e. not Hell or the Abyss) but part of Planescape (i.e. Mortuary, Fortune's Wheel, Crumbling Citadel, Armory, etc).  <br />
In addition, each one showcases several factions/guilds (i.e. 1st showcases the Sodkillers, the Minder's Guild, and the Ring Givers -and possibly others as we build -for instance the mercenary in Elysium could be a Cipher -while the second one deals with the Dustmen, Anarchists, and Doomguard -including their sects -wait for the third proposal).</p>

<p>Thus, each one introduces parts of the Campaign Setting, but together, the paint a much more holistic presentation.  A DM and/or players that went through the entire Arc would have a pretty good footing in the setting (which is, after all the point of this exercise). </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>For that matter, when exactly are you planning on having them fight the Death Slaad? </div></p>

<p>Plan -such a dirty word for PS modules.  But seriously though, the PCs will have a very real choice in the end: do they side with the Slaad or do they fight Taixu.</p>

<p>If they do, it will be a very tough fight -but its supposed to be -its the climax of the whole adventure arc.  </p>

<p>By that time, the PCs will be around 9th to 10th ECL.  Look at the standard and rules and you will see that an appropriate end campaign boss fight would be an EL of 13.  And you know what? -that is exactly what Taixu's CR is -funny how things work out, isn't it?</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>No offence, but I think these modules will need a major rework if they are to be suitable for new players.</div></p>

<p>No offense taken -however, I hope you also don't take offense when I reiterate that you need to recheck your comments.  Also, the module isn't specifically for new players -but is for players who are new to the Planescape setting.  </p>

<p>Look, I am absolutely ok if we don't decide to use this/my proposal.  If we all say, "nay, we want it to deal with the Blood War, or a Factol in one of the Mazes" than I am fine with that.  </p>

<p>Nick, </p>

<p>Well I read your proposal, and I would like to make some comments, but I think it would be best if I let others respond first, as my views could be interpretted as being biased.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Ah, I see.</p>

<p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but Dialexis wants to introduce a 'adventure sandbox' like The Faction War (in which there's a general sequence of events, backgrounds, et al without there being any definite path/answer.)</p>

<p>This is cool. I love things like that, and it's a very traditional part of the PS setting. On the other hand, as has been said before, we should start small. I'd love to introduce a campaign arc that has a nefarious <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/monsters/ravid.htm" class="bb-url">Ravid</a> villian who has to be anchored to the quasi-elemental plane of Salt to be weakened before the climatic battle, with multiple underlings, et al^, it's simply too ambitious and too out there for an introduction to the Campaign Setting.</p>

<p>There's three primary things we need to hit in Planescape to make a suitable first adventure(s).</p>

<p>1 - The Inner Planes [We might want to stick with the 'real' ones - Fire, Positive, Water, et al.]<br />
2 - The Outer Planes [Lower Planes tend to be better here]<br />
3 - Factions [Sigil, of course, is packaged in here. We don't need to introduce them all, though. A good thing to do would be to introduce two opposing factions and a third, neutral faction that both are seeking to court for aid - say, the Doomguard, the Harmonium, and the Dusties.]</p>

<p>That's it.</p>

<p>^I'm serious, email me about it some time if you wish.</p>

<p>[Side note - the Death Slaad's plan sounds a lot like a clever LE villans' to me. Sowing disorder among your enemies through carefully planted literature and words? While I like your explanation of as "Corruption Corrupts", I kind of feel that it's best that characters are introduced to Slaad and Modron before being introduced to rogues of both.]</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>OF,</p>

<p>Well, you are close, but the adventure arc that I propose actually is linear (at least to the same degree that most standard published modules are).  In the end, the climax is the same, but the resolution is up to the PCs (which is an essential part of many Planescape adventures -and games -and hence, should be something we introduce to initiates of PS).</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>There's three primary things we need to hit in Planescape to make a suitable first adventure(s). </p>

<p>1 - The Inner Planes [We might want to stick with the 'real' ones - Fire, Positive, Water, et al.] <br />
2 - The Outer Planes [Lower Planes tend to be better here] <br />
3 - Factions [Sigil, of course, is packaged in here. We don't need to introduce them all, though. A good thing to do would be to introduce two opposing factions and a third, neutral faction that both are seeking to court for aid - say, the Doomguard, the Harmonium, and the Dusties.] </div><br />
 <br />
I agree -and hence have tried to implement each element.  </p>

<p>(see my previous posts for citing of how eac part is incorporated)</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>[Side note - the Death Slaad's plan sounds a lot like a clever LE villans' to me. Sowing disorder among your enemies through carefully planted literature and words? While I like your explanation of as "Corruption Corrupts", I kind of feel that it's best that characters are introduced to Slaad and Modron before being introduced to rogues of both.]</div></p>

<p>Whoa -how come everyone assumes that all the smart and clever villians are LE (anyone ever hear of Grazz't?).  </p>

<p>Sowing heretical, revolutionary and fictitious literature? -that's straight out of the Anarchist's Cookbook.  Misinformation sowing Disorder -that's Chaos, not Law's Modus Operandi.</p>

<p>As for introducing the "normal" before the atypical -you have a point there -which is exactly why I wrote in the PCs first having an encounter with a Red Slaadi in the 1st adventure (as well as a number as a Modron in the Fortune's Wheel who acts like a probability gambler/scientist).</p>

<p>In the second adventure, the PCs are in turn introduced to a Green Slaadi and a group of "typical" rogue Modrons.  Only at the very end of the second do they interact with Carnot (Taixu disguised as Japhy Gadar).</p>

<p>In the final adventure, the PCs will interact with a couple of Blue Slaadi and encounter "normal" non-rogue Modrons.  </p>

<p>Thus, helping any new players not get confused (or at least any more confused than the rest of us, haha!)</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>3rd module (and official end of the Adventure Arc):</p>

<p>The PCs are contacted by a representative of the Fraternity of Order in Sigil. </p>

<p>This can occur in two different ways.</p>

<p>If the PCs are new, or are doing the adventure as a stand-alone module, then they are simply contacted and sent an invitation to meet with a Guvner for employment.</p>

<p>If they are the same PCs from the 2nd adventure, then they are contacted after the PCs are brought to court/trial for “trespassing” (and possibly slaying a Slaad and some Modrons) in the Armory.  The trial ends with the PCs being quickly acquitted, but only after the PCs tell the Dabus of their deeds and the events of Carnot and the Apocalypse Engine in the Crumbling Citadel.  Mabru (aka, The Harmonium) would indeed be concerned with the events (especially the existence of a partially functioning portal to the Plane of Ash), but the real instigator of the trial would be none other than Jamis, Factol of the Fraternity of Order.</p>

<p>Due to the seriousness of the events, Jamis needed to make sure that the PCs were telling the truth (call it a “truth-experiment”).  </p>

<p>Once the PCs have demonstrated their veracity, they receive an invitation to a semi-secret library of the Guvner’s.  Jamis has recently returned to Sigil as she promised, with a modest group of Faction members and have begun to establish a new safehouse and library for the Guvner’s.</p>

<p>She has become interested in the PCs and the events surrounding Carnot and the Apocalypse Engine as she was present when Carnot and Japhy Gadar arrived at the Fortress of Disciplined Enlightenment, and Carnot searched for the “full treatise” on the Fundamental Paradox of Equilibrium and Perpetual Movement.</p>

<p>Jamis became interested in the rogue Modron’s search, and so she continued to investigate the matter even after they left.  Eventually, she discovered information regarding Carnot’s heretic trial and condemnation, and it revolving around a false Guvner treatise.  </p>

<p>However, by this time, the pair was long gone from Mechanus.  Jamis simply stored it away as information.  But when she heard of the PC’s tale, she became very interested again –especially when she began to hypothesize concerning what kinds of Chaos the Modron might do (or perhaps whether or not it was actually on the cusp of discovering one of the sacred Axioms).  </p>

<p>Either way, Jamis is highly interested in discovering what Carnot is up to, but cannot investigate personally since she and her small number of Guvner’s in Sigil are busy setting up the new safehouse and trying to keep a relatively low profile (rightly being concerned about retaliations from old enemies).<br />
Thus, she hires the PCs (with the promised reward, not only being wealth, but possibly access to rare tomes and/or lore).  </p>

<p>Her first lead is that after Carnot left Mechanus, it was next seen in Pandemonium.  Drawing upon her magic and resources, she has located roughly were that was, and so sends the PCs off to see what they might find.</p>

<p>However, first the PCs will need to travel from Sigil to the Outlands –as the only “reliable” portal she knows of is in the plane’s gate-town, Bedlam.  The PCs will travel to Bedlam (on the way, possibly having an encounter with a couple of Khaasta slave-raiders).</p>

<p>Once in Bedlam, the PCs will have to gain access to the portal that leads to Pandemonium (but not before having a run-in with some barmy Bleakers and a Shadow Fiend –or maybe a Whisper Demon, or Allip).</p>

<p>Once on the first layer, Pandesmos, the PCs can follow Jamis’ information to Taixu and Carnot’s old laboratory/base.  Currently, it has been overrun by a small Howling Dragon (which actually might have been a strange “pet” of the Death Slaad).  In addition, the Dragon has picked up several Derro minions.   Diplomacy and/or bluffing will only get the PCs so far (as neither know where Carnot is, or what exactly they are up to –though the Howling Dragon, does know the true nature of Japhy Gadar as a Death Slaad), eventually they will have to battle the mad inhabitants.  </p>

<p>Assuming the PCs are victorious, they discover that it seems that neither Carnot nor Taixu have been to this site in a while.  They will find a significant amount of half-sane, coded writings and schematics.  <br />
Locked in cells, they will also discover a small number of literally “mad” scientists and theorists on perpetual motion and entropy.  Most have long since abandoned any semblance of sanity –though one such “patient” seems uniquely sane (or mostly sane, that is).  This prisoner, named Maxwell (who appears to be an incredible small Quasit in a Jar, with a Doorway filled with strange energy particles, which move at varying speeds) informs the PCs that Carnot was seeking a way to enforce entropic death into the Modron Energy Pool –in order to make it Lawful (seeing it currently as being in violation to Law).  <br />
Maxwell can tell them that all the inventors here had claimed to have created Perpetual Motion Machines, and were imprisoned until they successfully produced one –none succeeded.  (Of course, Taixu merely enjoyed seeing the entropic demise of their minds, and the catabolic creation process.</p>

<p>It was this last part that led the two unlikey allies to seek after Ylem.  Ylem has long been interested in "creation" and as such has studied deeply regarding positive energy, as it is a (if not THE) source of creation/life in the multiverse.  Shortly before the Faction War, Ylem shared research with the Godsmen, who were interested in his theories (as they viewed them similar to their views on the Source, and the eternal reincarnation/births/creation of the Multiverse.  Although the project was unfinished, it did yield some promising possibilities, though the Faction War halted its progress (with the Godsmen merging with the Signers and leaving Sigil for the Outlands).  </p>

<p>This information can be gleamed in part by speaking with Maxwell, and/or by deciphering Carnot's code-codex (Taixu's anarchist scribblings on the walls remain all by incomprehensible, but since they are written in Slaad and speak of Revolution, and the Glorious Spread of Anarchy, they might give some clues; however, they are nearly illegible, and they contradict each other, writing over each other, and often stopping mid-thought).</p>

<p>There is, however, no clue as to Carnot's whereabouts.</p>

<p>However, with this information, the PCs can travel back to Sigil (perhaps battling some Windblades before getting back to Bedlam).</p>

<p>Upon returning to Sigil and showing Jamis their findings, she will study them, trying to break the Modron code and interpret their meanings.  In the meantime, the Guvner Factol sends them to see Ylem about the "Genesis Infintum Project" as they seemed to have been very important to Carnot's study.</p>

<p>As they near Ylem's "residence", the PCs come upon the chaos of an attack by two Blue Slaadi and their "pet" Chaos Beast, who are overwhelming Ylem's guardians, and causing all kinds of disorder in his workshop.  Hopefully assisting Ylem in driving off his attackers (which was a result of Taixu trying to cover up the potential foil to his plan), the PCs are then able to discuss such matters with Ylem.  </p>

<p>The most likely outcome is that Ylem agrees to assist the PCs -as he is interested in seeing his research come to fruition (but lacks the fundage, since Zadara the Titan views it as being unprofitable).  With the Guvner's backing, Ylem is able to continue his research.  However, he tells the PCs that he needs them to retreive the Source Lattice (or as he calls it the Animus Absorbtion Actuator -or 3A)-supposedly a protype design of Ylem's that was built by the Godsmen.  The Lattice is said to be able to hold and contain positive energy without losing its vigor, but channeling it back to rejuvenate it.  </p>

<p>Accessing Jamis' resources, the PCs discover that the last known possessor of the Source Lattice was the now-Factol of the Mind's Eye.  Tracking him down to the Beastlands (and avoiding becoming prey, or at least some creature's meal), the PCs can retrieve the Source Lattice.  </p>

<p>Returning to Sigil, the PCs find that Ylem and Jamis have been hard at work.  Though they have not fully deciphered Carnot's writings and schematics, they can tell that it intends to use the Apocalypse Engine to bring about some kind of destruction.  <br />
However, the two have come across a plan that Ylem believes should be able to counter/nullify the Apocalypse Engine.  This entails building an antithesis of the Apocalypse Engine -something that Ylem refers to as a Genesis Engine.  However in order to complete the machine, he needs the PCs to obtain its core component and power source.</p>

<p>Using the Source Lattice, or 3A, the PCs will have to travel to all Four Positive Quasielemental Planes, and gather a portion of the Plane's raw essence.  Jamis and Ylem explain this is necessary since this is exactly what powers the Apocalypse Engine -raw negative quasielemental essence from their four planes, which the Sinkers and Dustmen had access to.</p>

<p>Thus, the PCs must go galavanting off to those 4 Planes -Radiance, Lightning, Mineral, and Steam (though not necessarily in any particular order).  PCs are forewarned about the dangers of these Planes and assisted in prepping (perhaps one of Ylem's constructs acting as a "guide" to the areas "rich" enough for the 3A to do its work.  </p>

<p>Such adventures might lead them to the Heart of Light (especially after getting involved in a fight between an Archon and an Efreeti) on the Plane of Radiance.  Depending on how they resolve the conflict with the Efreet, they may find assistance in the Djinni city of Stormfront in the Plane of Lightning -having to evade and survive a swarm of lightning mephits.  On the Plane of Steam/Mist, the PCs will have to travel to the Tower of Ice, where the PCs might get involved with a despute between alchemists or face a wild Marid.  PCs won't probably reach the Tower of Lead in the Plane of Mineral, but they may have to deal with a gang of Xorns, and a psionist and a crysmal.  (These encounters are just rough examples, there is a lot of wiggle room here).</p>

<p>While the PCs are off "charging" the 3A, Jamis will attempt to track down Carnot and Ylem will be busy crafting the rest of the Genesis Engine.</p>

<p>By the time they complete the mission in all 4 planes, the Genesis Engine is ready, and Jamis has discovered that Carnot and Taixu were recently seen in Arcadia -causing all kinds of trouble with the Harmonium.  </p>

<p>Together with Jamis, the PCs will travel to Arcadia, to its second layer, to the Headquarters of the Hardheads on the 2nd layer.  Jamis will speak with Faith -the current Factol -as the two are allies or sorts (and besides a minor assassination attempt by an Anarchist loyal to Taixu's cause, the events progress without conflict).</p>

<p>Through Faith, the PCs will learn that Carnot, Taixu, and a few other lackeys.  They purpse seemed not only to cause trouble, but also to use one of the Faction's portals to Mechanus (the faction is sending many expeditions and regiments in an attempt to reclaim the third layer of Arcadia -and hence having serious armed conflict with the expansionistic Formians).</p>

<p>Though she did not know what it was at the time, Faith can confirm that Carnot's group had the Apocalypse Engine, since they used it to devastating effect upon a Hardhead Batallion right before using the Portal to Mechanus.</p>

<p>After further discussion between the two Factols.  The PCs are accompanied by a group of Harmonium soldiers.  Passing through the Portal into Mechanus, the PCs find themselves thrown into the middle of a war between Hardheads and Formians (with the latter having the upper hand).  <br />
Hopefully with the PCs help, they are victorious, or at least make an escape.  They will then need to track down Carnot and the Engine -which won't be too hard do to the swath of destruction in its wake.  </p>

<p>However, at this point, Jamis will part from the PCs, traveling to her Faction's headquarters to get aid and more information.  </p>

<p>The PCs (and any surviving Hardheads) will eventually track down the rogue Modron an Death Slaadi, engaged in the midst of a battle between Formians and Modrons.  </p>

<p>Here is the final showdown -as Taixu reveals his true form and nature, he then imbeds Carnot with the Seed of Renbuu, which transform Carnots -not back into a Tertian, but into a unique Nonaton -and although is still Rogue, is followed and recognized by inferior Modrons as a non-Rogue.  This chaos causes a rippling effect of confusion and transfomations to rogue, and eventually a civil war among the Modrons (as Carnot commands all the surrounding Modrons to attack the violator of Law -which according to his intent, means attacking each other, -the whole time, each Modron death causing a drain upon the Modron Energy Pool -due to the Apocalypse Engine.  </p>

<p>How the PCs affect this could very wildly -they could attempt to nullify the effects of the Apocalypse Engine with the Genesis Engine and/or attempt to defeat Carnot-Nonaton and/or Taixu.  (Especially as Carnot's mind has changed with the transformation -he nows percieves Taixu and what how he attempted to manipulate him, and now as an entity of Chaos that needs to be purged.  Ironically, Carnot still desires the destruction of the Energy Pool  -thinking to set up a new Hierarchy of Modrons that follows all the Laws, and not flouts some -and so, views Taixu as the unwitting pawn of Law, and not the other way around).  </p>

<p>Thus, the PCs will have to decide with whom  the ally -or none at all.  Do they fight both Taixu and Carnot's Rogue Revolution?  Or do they aid the Rogue Revolution, but attempt to defeat the Slaad (or do they do the exact opposite)?  </p>

<p>Depending on what they choose, the conclusion could be vastly different (is  there now a new Modron Hierarchy -similar, but different (imagine like a new software update -or even new Modron forms).  Does this revolution help or hinder their battles with the Formians?  What is the final fate of the the two Engines -do they proximity to each other create a cataclysmic explosion -or fuse to create a new Modron Energy Pool for the Revolution?  </p>

<p>What happens to the Seed of Renbuu?  If Carnot is slain and the Seed expelled -does it come into contact with Taixu and create a new kind of Slaad (imagine Orange or Yellow or Indigo)?  </p>

<p>Depending on how it all concludes, the PCs might have opportunities to continue the campaign with fighting against or for the Rogue Revolution.  Or checking what kind of chaos a new color Slaad might get into.</p>

<p>Of course, in token of the Unity of Rings, for those PCs who complete all three modules, the adventure arc finale epilogue occurs when the PCs are called back to Sigil, by the proprietess of the Fortune's Wheel to celebrate and watch the Hatching of her Baby Wyrmlings -a grand party for a deserving band of Heros -or as the Ring Givers say -"It all comes full circle".</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Strikes me (now bear in mind that I'm new to 3.0/3.5 outside the confines of Neverwinter Nights) that if you're using pregens, you don't really need to start characters at a higher level to compensate for the ECL of some planars.  </p>

<p>The level adjustment's based (in most cases) on some inherent DR or snacky ability (like a Tiefer's darkness, and 5 point resist to elec, fire and cold). None of which is horribly unbalancing. </p>

<p>If the adventure doesn't place the party in a position where a the tiefer's going to be hit by cold, elec or fire, then his resistances count for nought. He's <span style="font-style:italic">effectively</span> ECL1 (EECL?  <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/lol.png" title="Laughing out loud" alt="Laughing out loud" class="smiley-content"/> ) and on a direct par with the human grunt at his side.</p>

<p>So, basically, if you're set on using pregens (which personally I wouldn't - half the fun's generating your own characters) you don't need to worry about ECLs - You can tailor the adventure to the party, and balance it that way. An ability that has no cause to be used may as well not be there, you see?</p>

<p>So, some may ask, what's the fun in playing a weird thing from the planes if the adventure doesn't allow you to use all your snackage (until the un-snacky mere mortals have met your ECL anyways)?</p>

<p>I say, <span style="font-style:italic">Roleplay</span>. A tiefer's going to have a tiefer's beliefs, and outlook on the world. As we all know, a key part of Planescape is the interplay between (and sheer plane-shattering importance of) beliefs. It ain't about the numbers, berk. If you're looking to be "uber" on numbers alone, you're in the wrong setting to begin with...</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Well spoken, Moog. However you must admit that with the transition to 3/3.5e, the freedoms of 2e have been somewhat reduced in exchange for a more consistent system. So the numbers are there, like it or not. To be rid of them is to simply go back to 2e, as far I can fathom. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but quite different from the purpose of Planewalker. So building an adventure without taking into account the possibilities of +ECL characters and other 'imbalances' could be disasterous, especially at lower levels.</p>

<p>Dialexis - haven't had time to read part 3 yet, but I'll comment on it when I do. <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/smile.png" title="Smiling" alt="Smiling" class="smiley-content"/></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I really <span style="font-style:italic">want </span>to agree with Moog's point, but I just can't escape the level balance issue. Players might find themselves feeling a bit hard done to, and it <span style="font-style:italic">is </span>a bit unfair it is on ECL 0 characters. </p>

<p>Sadly, I think that Iavas is basically right about the ECL system. Higher level starting adventures solve the problem.</p>

<p>But while I love the balancing out of primers (class levels) and planars (race + class levels) using ECLs, I really want to preserve that wonderful "first level adventurer" experience.</p>

<p>Tough call....</p>

<p>Basically it comes down to what PCs your individual group is generating - so we need to keep our options open as much as possible. As long as we do something along the lines of <span style="font-style:italic">Dungeon </span>magazine's <span style="font-style:italic">'scaling the adventure'</span> sidebars, I think individual DMs can handle the rest.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>I'm not sure I was advocating a return to <span style="font-style:italic">2e</span>, even effectively, in my last post. I re-read it just to make sure, as people seem to be agreeing in principle with a point I wasn't actually trying to make.  <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/lol.png" title="Laughing out loud" alt="Laughing out loud" class="smiley-content"/> </p>

<p>I'll try and explain my point a different way, and while I do so, it should be taken into account that I don't actually own the 3.5e core books (Poor timing, essentially - I went to the gaming shop and bought the three 3.0 core books, and when I went back a week later, everything was 3.5, and I was like, WTH?);</p>

<p>It is my understanding that you are trying to create a low level (1 - 4, say) adventure arc to introduce the planescape setting to newcomers. </p>

<p>It's also my understanding that the intention is to use <span style="font-style:italic">Pregens</span>, because it allows the writers greater control, (we know the party mix, so we also have a fair idea of the working dynamic of the group,) and adds to the pick-up-and-playability of the finished product.</p>

<p>I take it from previous posts that a problem has been highlighted, because according to some, the "feel" of the setting is hampered when one is not able to play Tieflings and the like, because a level 1 Tiefling (frex) is the equivalent of a Level 2 Elf (frex) according to the ECL rules.</p>

<p>Looking at our Elf and Tiefling examples, there's not much in a Tiefling's reportoire of snackiness that makes it any better than an Elf in an unbalancing way. There's the 5 point elemental resistances, and that Darkness ability.</p>

<p>We have created an artificial gaming environment where we control most if not all of the variables - a linear style adventure arc, and pregenerated PCs. It is not out of the realms of possibility to engineer the artificial gaming environment so that the Tiefling's resistances are not needed until the rest of the (level adjust +0) party have hit level 2. </p>

<p>At this point, our Tiefer will still be level 1, assuming identical experience awards.</p>

<p>To balance it out completely, we simply require the Tiefer to <span style="font-style:italic">"earn"</span> his first level before he can progress. Effectively, the Tiefling starts play on -1000 exp. (Other +ECL races can be given similar treatment).</p>

<p>We're insisting they play with our characters, we might as well also insist they play by an adventure arc specific "house rule" too.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it might be a wang load easier to write the adventure with a load of green primes pregenned straight out of the PHB, and introduce Tiefers, Modrons and other such weirdness as NPCs, thus retaining the much vaunted "flavour".</p>

<p>This approach has benefits;</p>

<p>1) No ECL grief.</p>

<p>2) Easier on the DM (who's new to the setting, too) when the new and unusual races aren't doing new and unusual things (as players are likely to do) to other new and unusual things in new and unusual ways.</p>

<p>3) Much more fun when only the DM has anything approaching a solid grasp on what's going on, and why, leaving the players to ask questions and find out <span style="font-style:italic">in the course of play</span> rather than asking, OOC, "What does my planar character know about X, DM?"</p>

<p>As an aside, when I'm running a campaign, I normally insist that players play primers until they're at least comfortable and reasonably fluid with their planar cant. I find that's a good way of measuring whether they're likely to be able to play a planar with confidence, and minimum gameworld questions.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Agreed, Rhys. I still have no clue how to use ECL properly, but dang it I need to learn! The only 'Planewalker Official' changes should be those that aren't covered by WotC (or covered incorrectly, ala <span style="text-decoration:underline">Manual of the Planes</span>). I would also highly suggest proposing alternate statistics for certain planar creatures, especially Yugoloths and Slaadi. In other words, absolutely necessary for Planescape without adding too many house rules.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Moog,</p>

<p>Have to say Ditto to Iavas' comments.  Also, remember that some of these LA races (like Aasimar) have racial modifiers that all positive and none that are negative -so such is really impossible to exculde in module parity.  Likewise, we are only thinking of including pregen characters, but firmly allowing non-pregen PCs in the design (for as you said, most Players find an essential degree of satisfaction and enjoyment from making their own PC).</p>

<p>Iavas,</p>

<p>No problem.  I am of course very interested in your opinion (as well as everyone else's).  And along that line -Rhys, are you still out there?  Since Rhys was the catalyst for this project, I'd venture that his/her opinion would be inimically tied to the project.</p>

<p>And to everyone in general,</p>

<p>Armoury99's adevnture module is fantastic -and even works well with being an adventure for ECL 1-2nd level PCs.  As it seems (so far) that it is a stand-alone adventure and is almost completely finished (wordings and DCs and side-treks already done and written) -my personal opinion is that we should adopt it as the First Introductory Adventure for Planewalker.</p>

<p>Granted, it doesn't deal with the Inner Planes, or even any portals or traveling the planes besides Sigil itself, but it does do a wonderful job of conveying a good number of Planescape's "feel" and "style" as well as doing a great job in introducing a portion of Sigil and a number of guilds and Factions.</p>

<p>I actually think we should adopt the adventure, finish it up (not that there is all that much to do -Armoury99 has done nearly everything).</p>

<p>Afterwords, I would suggest that we all then work on an adventure arc (something which would certainly be a bigger project -and one where we can introduce other aspects, factions, planes, etc -as well as culminating in some relatively minor change -or potential change- in the setting itself).</p>

<p>*Sure, I think my 3-part proposal fits this bill, but others may want something else.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Estimated Character Level is a monster's number of Hit Dice, plus the Level Adjustment, plus his class levels. I know WotC presents it as being more complicated than that, but it really isn't. Basically the thing to remember about ECL is that under the current rules, it isn't a very good barometer of a creature's power. This is because the Level Adjustment system doesn't work, but I'm sure most of you have heard that rant before. Basically, if you want to find the approximate toughness of a monster, don't give ECL more than a passing glance, and instead add the class levels to the CR. </p>

<p>For player characters though, this gets much, much harder to do. Nearly all races with monstrous hit dice and a Level Adjustment are massively over-charged (a good example would be the Khaasta, although most high CR monsters are equally cheated). If you ignore the LA entirely though, you sometimes wind up with a balanced race, but usually end up with a monster that is simply too good (or sometimes still too bad). A lot of people use a system based on CR and that <span style="font-style:italic">almost</span> works, but it has it's own problems. </p>

<p>Now you know what ECL is, and knowing is half the battle. Of course, for an introductory adventure, we have to use the Rules As Written, so just ignore that last paragraph.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

I didn't mean for my post about Level Adjustments to seem like I was shooting down the possibility of designing the adventure arc to render equal the disparate ECLs of a poly-LA adventuring party. <span style="font-style:italic">Why did I write that last sentence like that?</span> I'm just weighing in on the issue in favor of staying close to the official rules. That way, what we do change is changed only for the purposes of demonstrating what makes Planescape different from "regular" D&amp;D.</p>

<p>What if we made the pregens 1st level characters, but we adopted the House Rule that LA+1 races are balanced with core races if they begin 1st level with an "apprentice level," rather than a full one.</p>

<p>Apprentice levels are a concept that was introduced in the 3.5 DMG to allow multiclassing at level 1. They give some of, but not all of, the abilities granted by the first level of that class. The idea is that once you hit level 2, you turn the apprentice level into a full level, and then progress from there.</p>

<p>It works fine in my mind, but there is the issue of apprentice levels being detailed only for the core classes. Really, though, coming up with apprentice level abilities is the work of approximately 30 seconds per class.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Hmm, that's an idea, but I'm not sure how appealing/helpful that really is.  What I mean by that is that it still prevents Players from choosing Modrons, Githzerai, or anything that has a LA +2 (or higher, those these are rarer and nonstandard, even for Planescape).  Also, apprentice levels -depending on the class- can really, really bite (imagine being a tielfing apprentice wizard -not only would you be weak as most 1st level mages are, but you wouldn't even have access to your measly supply of 1st level spells).  For some classes, this is less of a penalty (for survivability and functionality -such as fighter).  And with all the new base classes, we would/might need to detail the apprentice levels for approximately 18+ classes.  </p>

<p>I think its a pretty good house rule, but I'd be leary of making it the crux behind the first module by Planewalker.  </p>

<p>Instead, I'd just suggest to use Armoury99's adventure as the first Planewalker module.  (He has done almost everything, and it is superb).  The adventure is extremely flexible in terms of level-appropriateness.</p>

<p>I'd merely peg it as officially for a part of PCs from level 1 - 2.  That way, you can still have it be a "first adventure" and still allow some LA+1 races (which are a good chunk of the Planescape PC races) without any adjustment at all.</p>

<p>And we could easily add a sidebar that might suggest your variant LA/apprentice level for DM's who absolutely want it to be ECL 1.</p>

<p>And we could also have a side-bar detailing how to increase the level of the adventure for DM's who wish to do so (and in Armoury99's proposal, this would be a piece of cake).</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;Dialexis&#039;</em> wrote:</div>Armoury99's adevnture module is fantastic -and even works well with being an adventure for ECL 1-2nd level PCs.  As it seems (so far) that it is a stand-alone adventure and is almost completely finished (wordings and DCs and side-treks already done and written) -my personal opinion is that we should adopt it as the First Introductory Adventure for Planewalker</div></p>

<p>A moment please while I bask in the praise (Dialexis, your cash is on its way!) now back to business:</p>

<p>I did indeed originally intend for <span style="font-style:italic">Desire and the Dead</span> to be a stand alone adventure - or rather a jumping off point for a campaign that the DM could take in numerous directions, but since this thread got started I've been thinking about how it could be arced. Frankly however, I really don't think <span style="font-style:italic">I've </span>got the time to do two more complete adventures however, so if anyone else wants to run with the NPCs (once their done) and do two more scenarios they have my unreserved aid and blessing (assuming the project wants to do this).</p>

<p>The team could then include things like the inner/outer planes introduction, and the other things we've been discussing for the introductory scenarios should have (my scenario was deliberately designed as 'limited exposure' to the planes to keep things simple for first timers).</p>

<p>I particularly think that Ambergris and Desire's private little war could be expanded on, as the PCs get embroiled in working for one or the other - or against both - and personally I'd like to see Desire get her cumuppance too. </p>

<p>Given the number of potential outcomes from <span style="font-style:italic">DATD </span>however, I think any follow ons would have to be 'sandbox style' as discussed above.</p>

<p>but just go for it, as far as I'm concerned.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Nice. Tad'faddamfa's easy to develop since he doesn't appear in person, only hearsay - and I particularly like the <span style="font-style:italic">real </span>sweatshops. A thought - If we do go down this road, would it be better to keep Old Toadface as a slaad, to introduce the PCs to that race? We'd have to work up his personality more to make sure he wasn't just "a fiend by any other name" (I appreciate that point a lot).</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dialexis' Adventure Arc:</span></p>

<p>Having finally had the time to give Dialexis' campaign arc a good read, I have to say that on the whole I like it alot but I also agree in parts with others' critiques: Specifically, while I love the multiple groups and layers of hidden/disguised NPCs, its just too complicated for new players who may be just coping with the Planes themselves yet! Also, its epic tangled plotting and I'd like some more staright forward adventures to newbies first.</p>

<p>Clearly, he's writting a scenario for experienced D&amp;Ders (just new to the planes), while I was trying to get relatively new D&amp;Ders as well as PSers -although the vast majority of use for our scenarios <span style="font-style:italic">will </span>probably come from veterans already signed in at PW.com.</p>

<p>I especially like having a LAw/Chaos conflict rather than the traditional good v evil fight. L v C will also probably create in-party tensions and strained alleigences - and hopefully good rp opprotunities...</p>

<p>Personally, I'd prefer to go "the whole hog" with Dialexis' scenarios and have it as the equivalent of <span style="font-style:italic">Hellbound </span>(our first 'super-heroic adventure'), with a couple more low level adventures inbetween mine and his - to introduce players to the Factions, Races, NPCs involved in it. That way DMs could in theory play through all SIX (am I getting way ahead of myself here?) adventures for a complete campaign; from lost in the Hive to saving the modron race! (and what a way to bring them back against the formians, assuming the PCs succeed...)</p>

<p>I think my only other comment is that we'd have try and keep the PCs' options open for who exactly they're working for by the time the last installment of Taizu's plan comes round.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

          Planescape Introductory Adventure        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>I was thinking over links between Armoury99's stand-alone adventure and tie-ins with my proposal for an adventure arc; here are my ideas relative to that:</p>

<p>Since Armoury99's adventure: Desire and the Dead, is a 1-2nd ECL adventure, PCs who complete such should be about 3-4th, if they completed most of the plot-lines.  As such, they would be "ready" level-wise for the first of the three arcs (obtaining the copper dragon eggs and such -I've deliberately left the names unfinished as I want it to become a group project of Planewalker).</p>

<p>As to why they would go from slumming it in the Grey District to rolling dice or what-not in the Fortune's Wheel, well there are a couple of reasons.</p>

<p>Last year ago, as Armoury99 said, a altriustic Ring-Giver was murdered and found near Old Toadface's workshop.</p>

<p>The Dark of the matter is that Old Taodface may diguise himself as a Slaad to throw off and decieve the common populace, but in reality is a Hydroloth, whose appearance is easy enought to be misinterpreted for a Slaad.  Old Toadface -or Tad'Faddamfa is a bit more mischevious than most Hyrdoloths, in particular, he has found a respite from common mercenary work in the Blood War, by relocating to Sigil and the Hive (perhaps through a portal or through the River Styx itself, since it does wind through the City of Doors).  <br />
Of course, Tad'Faddamfa has this "permission" from his overseer/master, an Ultroloth of Hades.  </p>

<p>In particular this Ultroloth named [Disthymis] has a cruel fixation on studies in creating despair and long-term depression in mortals.  Tad'Faddamfa is just another servant who carries out his vile "experiments".  Not only does Old Toadface duplicitiously act as a minor agent of the 'loths and Disthymis, but her sweatshops are not merely "fronts" for his nefarious dealings -they are an experiment in evil -the dreadful working conditions push the mortals to limits of hoplessness and deprivation, all in an attempt to crush their spirits -literally until they belong to Disthymis and Hades.  </p>

<p>Of course, Tad'Faddamfa also "enjoys" the use of distillation of mortal depression (thus the sweat-shops -really are shops in sweat -but the perspiration is then distilled into raw despair and melacholia -which is of course an interest to several Dustmen as well and the passionless residents of the Grey -though most have no clue as to the source of the vile substance).  </p>

<p>Naturally, with the Hyrdoloth's connection to Styx water and his Sleep-spittle, these experiements can become all the more sinister.  (The pact making also betrays his 'loth nature).  </p>

<p>Anyways, this altruistic (perhaps Elysian in origin) Ring-Giver came to the District stirring up the worst kind of trouble for Old Toadface -Hope.  </p>

<p>And to the twisted Ring-Giver, Tad'Faddamfa beleived that this Ring Giver "owed" him -for had he not incured a debt by disrupting all his hard work?  Indeed, and so the Hyrdoloth went to "give" the charitable Ring-Giver a lesson: it's not wise to tangle with the schemes of a 'loth.  </p>

<p>And after giving such a "gift" (which included torturing the sap and draining his memories with Styx and sapping his spirit with distilled mortal melancholia), he then "gave" the Elysian a final gift -release, and Death.</p>

<p>Well, as the Great Ring spins as they say, the Copper Dragoness was a friend of the missing Elysian Ring-Giver and in order to give and repay a debt, she attempts to discover what happened to her friend.</p>

<p>Enter the PCs. </p>

<p>As "problem-solvers" of the Vocies, they could be hired -via the Dragoness -to discover what happened.  </p>

<p>The nature of this adventure could be complex or short (as each DM would like).  But in the end, victorious PCs will find themselves now having the wealthy Dragoness Ring-Giver in debt to them -who has them travel to the Fortune's Wheel to receive their payment...</p>

<p>And as they all gather (inculding other PCs for other intitial reasons), the adventure arc begins as proposed...</p>

<p>And as the second adventure arc, the PCs are hired by the Dustmen Factotum: who is actually Ambergis -who remembers the PCs as problem solvers -and the PCs are unobtrusive "detectives".  </p>

<p>Lastly, for the thirs module, the PCs might the Worthy as one of the builder-smiths imprisoned by Carnot and Taixu and if freed might then help the PCs and Ylem (as he was a Godsmen, and perhaps part of building the original Source Lattice and might be essential in building the Genesis Engine).</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

          Planescape Introductory Adventure        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Here's an interesting bit.</p>

<p>The traditional LA system (as presented in the 3.5 Monster Manual) advocates allowing LA+X characters to take their place in the party as<span style="font-style:italic"> first level characters</span>, something which I find great for an introductory adventure.</p>

<p>For example, a Drow (LA+2) would begin at first level with his companions, but simply advance slower.</p>

<p>In all honesty, LA+ characters can be underwhelming for a number of reasons, and their fun-loss tend to show up fast ("Hey, why does everybody else get to level up?")</p>

<p>So why not let them? If you've got new D+D players, it might be cool to throw them a bone - "You're a Bladeling, so you can fire knives out of your skin...", and for experienced players, it might be fun to be able to play something they'd never normally consider due to level adjustment qualifications.</p>

<p>They'd still have to stick with 1 HD though, for obvious reasons.</p>

<p>You can adjust the encounter levels up slightly to compensate for one or two planetouched/etc. PCs. They're still first level, so it's not like much will change - even the much-vaunted Rogue Modron* is still casting Color Spray or using a standard Greatsword. [They make really good casters at this level, but playing a Level-Adjusted Caster soon makes it's penalties clear. Don't worry.]</p>

<p>[*Sure, your player may not act like a 'real Rogue Modron'. But I think a lot of the reason Planescape has had such a steep introduction curve is because of the stigma attached to, well, 'Clueless Primes' [or Players]. Sure, they may not get it 'completely right', but the new DM can learn with the players - or the not-so-new DM can give them some tips. I think it'd be fun - give them the benefit of the doubt.]</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Nice. Tad'faddamfa's easy to develop since he doesn't appear in person, only hearsay - and I particularly like the <span style="font-style:italic">real </span>sweatshops. A thought - If we do go down this road, would it be better to keep Old Toadface as a slaad, to introduce the PCs to that race? We'd have to work up his personality more to make sure he wasn't just "a fiend by any other name" (I appreciate that point a lot).</div></p>

<p>Armoury99, </p>

<p>Glad you like the development.  I actually would not have Tad'Faddamfa as a real Slaad -some have already said that Taixu is already an aberrant enough of a Slaad.  And I really don't think we can have Old Toadface be CN -as any other Slaad we introduce should be.  </p>

<p>And besides, that way we can introduce Yugoloths -for as we all know -nothing screams Planescape setting as much as a Yugoloth -excpet for a Yugoloth pretending to be something else, right?  </p>

<p>Better to let the PCs have their first real interaction with Slaadi be on Elysium with the Reds and Chaonds -who are "standard" CN Slaadi.</p>

<p>And that way we can introduce the Yugoloths to the new Planescape Players and DM -which I think is important from the get-go (especially since they haven't appeared elsewhere in my or Armoury99's module proposals as of yet).</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Having finally had the time to give Dialexis' campaign arc a good read, I have to say that on the whole I like it alot but I also agree in parts with others' critiques: Specifically, while I love the multiple groups and layers of hidden/disguised NPCs, its just too complicated for new players who may be just coping with the Planes themselves yet! Also, its epic tangled plotting and I'd like some more staright forward adventures to newbies first.</div></p>

<p>Well, first thank you for reading my arc proposals and thank you for the compliments.  To address your concerns: yes, you are right -I was righting for not necessarily new DM/players, but for DM/players new to Planescape (since this was what Rhys wanted).  I also wanted the arc to be of interest and use to veterans of Planescape (who are probably the majority of Planewalkers -I'm guessing here).</p>

<p>Also, remember, that despite all the intrigue -most of it does not need to be directly done by the PCs as it is written (to accommadate hack-n-slash players).  </p>

<p>I also have to chuckle at your comments on claiming to want straightforward adventures for newbies, Armoury99: I mean, DatD is anything but straightforward (one of the reasons I love it) -and as you said -is far away from a dungeon crawl.  The PCs are hired to "fix" a vague problem.  It is a mystery adventure, which is free form and event based rather than site based adventure -you have Xaositects disguised as Dustmen, who actually being duped in carrying around a magic object that was crafted by a smith who was duped as to its real intent, who is in fact a Sensate that they do not directly defeat -and actually has no "BBEG", and the PCs can side with whomever as there is no absolute good or evil side.  </p>

<p>None of this is meant to be offense -I absolutely love DatD -but a big part of why is due to the subtlety and non-linear nature of the adventure -which is inimical to Planescape.  Hence, I thought it strange to comment on the very things that make your adventure so great.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Clearly, he's writting a scenario for experienced D&amp;Ders (just new to the planes), while I was trying to get relatively new D&amp;Ders as well as PSers -although the vast majority of use for our scenarios <span style="font-style:italic">will </span>probably come from veterans already signed in at PW.com.</div></p>

<p>Dead on -this was what Rhys clarified was the object of the adventure design.</p>

<p>However, I think that both of our ideas work together fantastically.  If we have DatD as the intitial adventure, and a follow-up one that acts as the bridge (with Toadface and the Ring-Givers), then the DMs and Players will be ready for a more "complex/advanced" adventure (*note, I don't think my proposal is any more complex than DatD, except for it being a three-part module, but since everybody else does...)</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>I especially like having a LAw/Chaos conflict rather than the traditional good v evil fight. L v C will also probably create in-party tensions and strained alleigences - and hopefully good rp opprotunities...</div></p>

<p>Thank you -such was deliberate -and for those very reasons (also exposing another unique facet of Planescape -whereas, in most other campaign setting, the ethical axis is subordinate to the moral axis).<br />
 <br />
<div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Personally, I'd prefer to go "the whole hog" with Dialexis' scenarios and have it as the equivalent of <span style="font-style:italic">Hellbound </span>(our first 'super-heroic adventure'), with a couple more low level adventures inbetween mine and his - to introduce players to the Factions, Races, NPCs involved in it. That way DMs could in theory play through all SIX (am I getting way ahead of myself here?) adventures for a complete campaign; from lost in the Hive to saving the modron race! (and what a way to bring them back against the formians, assuming the PCs succeed...)</div></p>

<p>I think this is an excellent idea.  (However, is there a need for two more in between DatD and the arc? -I think it only needs to be one)</p>

<p>So as follows (however, the beauty of it is that any combination could act as a stand alone adventure):</p>

<p>1st level adventure: Desire and the Dead</p>

<p>3rd level adventure: investigating the death of the Elysian Ring-Giver, and "dealing" (in all the possible meanings) with Old Toadface.</p>

<p>(In this adventure, we could not only introduce the Yugoloths, but maybe have a part of the adventure be in Hopeless -Hades' Gatetown, and thus the first portal travel outside Sigil, and have the possibility of "resolving" things with Eyes' Desire, as well as introduding the Ring-Givers, as well as a few other facets, but still at least half of the adventure still in the Grey District).</p>

<p>5th level adventure: Adventure Arc, part 1 (with all tie-ins as proposed)</p>

<p>7th level adventure: Adventure Arc, part 2</p>

<p>9th level adventure: Adventure Arc, part 3 </p>

<p>(and depending on how they resolve it, i.e. which side the PCs side with, it might then open up for helping or fighting against the Modron Rogue Revolution.  This could easily be another Adventure Arc, taking the PCs from 11th to 20th level).  <br />
This would only be in the far, future, but is a viable option if we so choose.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>I think my only other comment is that we'd have try and keep the PCs' options open for who exactly they're working for by the time the last installment of Taizu's plan comes round.</div></p>

<p>Yes, such was my intention as well -and was written to inculde the flexibility for such.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Armoury99, </p>

<p>Let me know if you want/need any help with the "2nd intro".</p>

<p>As for things to introduce: </p>

<p>Factions: so far, in the current module proposals, we will at the end have introduced/featured, all but the Athar, the Indeps, and the Sons of Mercy (granted some of the others make smaller appearances such as the Ciphers and the Fated, as we have currently written it up). </p>

<p>For the guilds, we will have introduced the Minder's and the Funerary Guild, as well as the court system.</p>

<p>-We haven't done anything with the Daughters of Light or Merkhant Sect, or the Planarists, but I don't think we need to introduce everything (though maybe we can have some of the small side encounters have some tie-in).</p>

<p>My personal suggestion is that in the adventure module, we will of course deal with the Ring-Givers (not only the murdered altruistic one, and the true patron Dragoness, but also Old Toadface).  Perhaps, we can even somehow show the reciprocal relationship with the Fated (perhaps through the Innkeeper's development/tie-in).  Who knows, maybe a Fated has made a "deal" with Old Toadface or the 'loths.  </p>

<p>As for the Sons of Mercy...  maybe we could tie-in the altruistic Ring-Giver was actually a planar aasimar-gnome from Bytopia -it would make sense then with the idea of the communal cooperation -giving and aiding and expecting the community to likewise aid.  Also, it makes sense that a gnome would be good friend with a Copper Dragoness (as the two races have a great affinity to one another).</p>

<p>If we go this route, then maybe we could use this to introduce the Sons of Mercy (since they are based out of Bytopia).  Perhaps, the gnome/aasimar Ring-Giver had relatives -a gnome/aasimar paladin, Son of Mercy? -who has now likewise traveled to Sigil to find his missing [cousin].  Also featuring the Sons of Mercy would be nice since as a "murder mystery" they would fit right in, adding their own unique view of justice (even to someone as evil as a loth?)  Likewise, it would then provide a great contrast to the next adventure where the PCs must deal with the Sodkillers and their own "justice".  </p>

<p>Lastly the Athar could have a Cameo by having a dark sect being allied (to some extent) with Old Toadface's boss -the Ultroloth Dysthymis.  I mean -I'm not trying to make the Athar evil -but it could make sense that the "godless" loths might ally with the "godless" Athar -though maybe for vastly different reasons.  </p>

<p>(i.e. maybe some scheme to siphon off deceased souls intended to go to Godly Realms -the loths interested in using such souls for their vile experiments, while the Athar might be more interested in weakening the Gods through lessening their source of power.  Toadface would be a natural part of this due to his location near the Mortuary and portals to Gods of the Dead and all. Through in the activities between the Shattered Temple and the Temple of Hades-to-be, and the possible connections grow all the stronger.  (this is just one possibility though -and it doesn't have to be on any big scale)</p>

<p>As for planes: though I'd imagine still a whole lot of it would be in Sigil (but maybe not all in the Gray District), we could introduce some planar sites in this one.</p>

<p>By the end of the modules thus far proposed, we will have covered 5 quasielemental planes (which does a pretty good job at covering the Inner Planes, IMO -especially considering that they will feature aspects of the "pure" elemental planes as well -i.e. an Efreeti and Xorns, etc).</p>

<p>We haven't done anything with the Transitives -maybe we want to, or maybe not?</p>

<p>As for the Great Wheel, we will have covered (and I'm counting the Gate-towns as cameos for the planes): Elysium, Beastlands, Ysgard, Pandemonium, Carceri, Archeron, Mechanus, Arcadia, and the Outlands -so  9 out of the 17 -not too shabby.</p>

<p>And if we include Bytopia and Hades (maybe the latter through Hopeless), that will be 11 out of the 17.</p>

<p>The only ones left would be Arborea, Limbo (but given their due with Slaadi as major antagonists), the Abyss (featured with Dretches, Rutterkin, and Babau), Gehenna (loths are kinda hitting this one too), and Baator and Celestia.</p>

<p>And if we extend the adventure arc into the Modron Rogue Revolution, then I already have some (great IMO) ideas for Incorporating Limbo, Arborea, Baator and Celestia.</p>

<p>Ok, that's enough rambling from Dialexis for now...</p> <div class="dice_rolls">
