          New PC Race: Ortho Dwarves        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
        <div class="dice_rolls">
</div> <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dwarves</span></p>

<p>	Dwarves on Ortho have always been a major power.  A race that managed to hold its own against the tides of chaos in all of its forms.  In truth, the Dwarves were never able to beat back that force and it always angered them.  The Dwarves of Ortho were, initially, skeptical of the Knights of Harmony's claims to be able to bring about peace to the world.</p>

<p>	Nevertheless, the Dwarves quickly grew interested as the Knights of Harmony systematically decimated the whole of the Chaos races on Ortho.  While individual Dwarves had allied with the Knights from the beginning, the whole race signed its allegiance over when plans were made to create the OCA.</p>

<p>	Now Dwarves are a major force of industry and power within the OCA.  Some, however, believe they have sold out their racial pride to become the allies of their mortal enemies.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Personality</span>:  The Dwarves of Ortho are typically clannish, hardworking, and traditionalist with a propensity towards ale.  Most of their kind are employed in heavy industries across Ortho and seem to favor the underground over the surface world.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Dwarves on Ortho do have some startling differences from stereotypes associated with them.  The first fact is that Dwarves on Ortho bear no particular racial grudges against monstrous humanoids.  Dwarves can be found working on their forges beside Giants, Hobgoblins, and other races that they have been long the enemies of.  The Dwarves have embraced the idea of harmony amongst the races.  </p>

<p>Furthermore, Dwarves are no longer inclined to spend their lives in fortified strongholds of their own kind.  Dwarves in Ortho are prone to living in human cities and amongst the other species with no hesitation.  Entire generations of Dwarves live and die amongst human cultures that they adopt whole heartedly and mix with their own cultural traits.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Physical Description</span>: Dwarves are short, stocky, and full muscled figures that tend to sport beards on the men.  Peculiarly, the Dwarves of Ortho place much less value upon their facial hair than some might expect  There is no particular shame in a Dwarf being clean shaven nor do they allow their beards to grow freely.  Most of the Dwarves of Ortho keep their beards well trimmed and never decorate them.</p>

<p>Dwarves tend to ape the style of the lands that they are living in.  Hence Shoryko Dwarves are usually adorned in long robes and prone to letting their fingernails grow out while those from Heka-Voll prefer a more chivalric attire.  Those from South Thaera are almost always clad in the drab and soot ridden rags of the region if they're not part of the military.</p>

<p>Though this is only a matter of degrees, most Dwarves of Ortho are more ostentatious than most OCA citizens.  Due to the relative safety of the land, they have let some of their hoarding quality filter off and prefer to flaunt their wealth.  This has lead there to be a preponderance of overweight and pudgy dwarves in a race that's usually revered for its austere fitness.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Alignment</span>: Most Dwarves are Lawful Good or Lawful Neutral on Ortho.  Devotion to the Harmonium has replaced some of the traditional notions of personal honor and responsibility amongst Dwarves, though.  Thus, strangely, there's a higher portion of Neutral and Chaotic Dwarves on Ortho than there are in other worlds.  Furthermore, a substantial number of Dwarves are actually Evil.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dwarven Lands</span>:  The only province with a massive populace of Dwarves is their homeland of Xaric.  The Harmonium allowed numerous other species to settle there, initially over Dwarven objections.  There has been a great deal of tension with the Orcish settlers despite the best efforts of the Dwarves to get them to assimilate.  Otherwise, it is a land of tolerance with the humans and Kobolds working prosperously with the stout folk there for mutual advantage.</p>

<p>Dwarves are, however, located throughout the whole of Ortho.  They are one of the most populous races in the world and a sight in every city.  Whereas other planets have the Dwarven race in decline, they are vigorous and expanding on this planet.  Some of the oldest members of their race still hold tremendous shame at their part in the many genocides that allowed this prosperity but most Dwarves consider that to be ancient history now.</p>

<p>Of special note amongst the Provinces are Motmurk, Irionda, South Thaera.  Motmurk is the only exception to the universal good will towards the race.  There Dwarves are actively persecuted by the Orcish majority. Irionda is filled with massive numbers of Dwarf settlers that have been located there by the state to make the poverty stricken province more profitable, to considerable tension with the locals.  South Thaera is also noteworthy since its ruler, Governor Granin is a Dwarf and prefers employing members of the race.  Granin is a controversial figure as some consider him a patriot and a hero while others believe he's nothing more than a mass murderer.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Religion</span>: Dwarves worship the Lords of Order but are not usually known for their devotion.  They revere no particular gods higher than any other but tend to merely revere the pantheon as a whole for the relevant circumstances.  Some Dwarves worship Saint Cuthbert but this is not approved of in polite society.  The greed of certain Dwarves also drives many to revere the god Alzrius who gives them tremendous riches.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Language</span>: Dwarves tend to speak Ortho Common, even above their native language of Dwarvish.  Dwarvish is a dying language and mostly practiced amongst those who are die hard advocates of their race.  Most Dwarves are also familiar with Beholder and Hobgoblin tongues.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Names</span>: Dwarves tend to take the names of their Clan first, despite the diminishing importance of it in their daily lives.  This means that most Dwarves have the name "Stoneledge" then something more provincial like "Thoris."  Some Dwarves have taken to having human-like names such as Fortitude or Mercy.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Adventurers</span>: Centuries of peace have changed the focus of most Dwarves.  No longer as they predominantly a race of fighters.  The majority of Dwarves never pick up a weapon in their lives and are only familiar with the weapons of their people because of their preponderance amongst the military.  There are actually more Dwarven Rogues active today than there are Fighters.</p>

<p>Curiously, the peace has encouraged many Dwarves to re-examine their long held bias against the arts of magic.  With the loss of the elves creating a great absence of talented spell casters.  The Dwarves applied for their love of craftsmanship to spell weaving and became the greatest magicians on Ortho.  Both Sorcerers and Wizards are now widely known amongst them.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline">Dwarven Racial Traits</span></p>

<p>    * +2 Constitution<br />
    * +2 Dexterity.<br />
    * Medium: As Medium creatures, dwarves have no special bonuses or penalties due to their size.<br />
    * Dwarf base land speed is 20 feet. However, dwarves can move at this speed even when wearing medium or heavy armor or when carrying a medium or heavy load (unlike other creatures, whose speed is reduced in such situations).<br />
    * Darkvision: Dwarves can see in the dark up to 60 feet. Darkvision is black and white only, but it is otherwise like normal sight, and dwarves can function just fine with no light at all.<br />
    * Stonecunning: This ability grants a dwarf a +2 racial bonus on Search checks to notice unusual stonework, such as sliding walls, stonework traps, new construction (even when built to match the old), unsafe stone surfaces, shaky stone ceilings, and the like. Something that isn’t stone but that is disguised as stone also counts as unusual stonework. A dwarf who merely comes within 10 feet of unusual stonework can make a Search check as if he were actively searching, and a dwarf can use the Search skill to find stonework traps as a rogue can. A dwarf can also intuit depth, sensing his approximate depth underground as naturally as a human can sense which way is up.<br />
    * Weapon Familiarity: Dwarves may treat dwarven waraxes and dwarven urgroshes as martial weapons, rather than exotic weapons.<br />
    * Stability: A dwarf gains a +4 bonus on ability checks made to resist being bull rushed or tripped when standing on the ground (but not when climbing, flying, riding, or otherwise not standing firmly on the ground).<br />
    * +2 racial bonus on saving throws against poison.<br />
    * +2 racial bonus on saving throws against spells and spell-like effects.<br />
    * +2 racial bonus on Appraise checks that are related to stone or metal items.<br />
    * +2 racial bonus on Craft checks that are related to stone or metal.<br />
    * Automatic Languages: Ortho Common and Dwarven. Bonus Languages: Beholder, Orcish, Hobgoblin<br />
    * Favored Class: Wizard</p>       </div>

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>There was talk of having a group dwarves on Ortho with a sort of insect-like culture. The Xaric and Motmurck entries both mention the Mantis Clan and other bug-themed groups, and they show up elsewhere in the PDF as well. One section even refers to them as "the Chitinous dwarf clans" (although I think it was a metaphor -- I doubt they actually have exoskeletons). Somehow, these guys never received a full PDF entry, and by the time I had gotten involved with the project, whoever originally came up with them had stopped talking about them.</p>

<p>Maybe Rip or Clueless or one of the other old hands can help us get some details on these guys together and give them a proper write-up. If not we may have to remake them from whole cloth. I'd rather not abandon them outright though, as I really like the idea of having two distinct and well explored dwarf groups on Ortho.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Content-wise, you state that the Dwarves dominate Xaric, but I'm pretty sure the PDF has Dwarves, Orcs, and Humans each holding about 30% of the population with Kobolds and other groups making up the other 10%. I might have the numbers off, but I know they aren't a majority. You should definitely reread the section on Xaric, as there are a few points (like the fact that it was the Harmonium that integrated the races there, not the dwarves) that you contradict.</p>

<p>Also, I'd suggest not mentioning dwarves from other worlds quite so much. Simply stating how dwarves on <span style="font-style:italic">Ortho</span> are should be sufficient for the most part. Their lack of a beard obsession is worth stating explicitly, however.</p>

<p>On a related note, up to this point Ortho has been entirely devoid of subraces (except for the two groups of Ogres, but that's different). It would be sort of silly to introduce them this late in development. I'd just not mention "hill dwarves" and "Duergar" at all.  </p>

<p>Lastly, I don't really see dwarves as rogues. I actually think Cleric would make the best favored class for them -- or even Wizard! That'd be something different, wouldn't it?</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Up to you guys, I made the changes that Duckluck wanted.  Knowing nothing about Bug-Dwarves, I decided to let that one slide and you can insert what you want there.</p>

<p>I also liked the idea of there being subraces that have since been "Harmonized."</p>

          New PC Race: Ortho Dwarves        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Elves, Dwarves, and Gnomes are all known for having a way more subraces than they need, but really any established D&amp;D race has had a subrace, or two. Most of these races wind up getting forgotten or swept under the rug (when's the last time you saw an Urds, or a Scro, or even recent ones like the desert elf?). </p>

<p>Others become mostly ignored parts of the game settings (especially Forgotten Realms) that were introduced by some writer way back when who thought they were cool and kept because they're traditional and a small subset of players think they're really neat. These ones only get played by people who are trying for something really unusual (like the Avariel), or want to play something that's really overpowered (like the Fey'ri).</p>

<p>There are maybe half a dozen subraces in the whole game that players actually care about, usually because they're radically different than the normal members of the race in culture and stats: these include Drow, Duergar, Svirfneblin (to a degree), and -- well, I can't actually think of anymore. It should be notable that Eberron ditched virtually all existing subraces (except Drow, for some reason) and no one really minded, so you can have a setting with no subraces. Given all the other changes we've made to the normal array of D&amp;D races, I see no reason why we need to keep them.</p>

<p>Lastly, I don't really mind subraces from a flavor standpoint, but mechanically, they get stupid quickly. They are usually either so similar to the generic race that they may as well have the same stats (like deep dwarves and mountain dwarves) or so different that, mechanically speaking, they aren't really the same race anymore (like Duergar). Either way, they're kind of stupid. Plus there are some odd racist overtones in applying inherent bonuses and penalties to what should really be <span style="font-style:italic">cultural</span> differences. Note that WotC has never divided humans into subraces, despite most settings having human groups that are just as different from each other as the various elf and dwarf subraces are.  </p>

<p>I'd suggest just saying that there are different dwarven groups with different skin colors, but ultimately, they're all just dwarves.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>As above - and we've also got plenty of "Lords of Chaos" to use as forbidden cults and blasphemous deities. Of course that certainly doesn't mean that Alzrius is worshipped and doesn't have cults, however.</p>

<p>Ages ago I was working on a human/beholder hybrid race that was originally the diplomatic buffer between Beholders and the Knights of Harmony, and now somewhat defranchised. Maybe they were dwarf/beholder crossbreeds instead?</p>

<p><span style="font-style:italic">ps </span>- for the reasons Charles outlined above and because they have the generally high INT and best class skills required for high tech artificing, Id say yes go with Wizard for the dwarf favoured class.

         <p>I think what Clueless means is this:</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div><span style="font-weight:bold">Planewalker Encyclopeodia: </span>Alzrius is the Lord of the Flowing Flame, and rules layer 601 of the Abyss, Conflagratum. His physical form is actually a large pillar of flame, and when his armies go on a campaign, the leader of the armies carries a piece of Alzrius's body as a torch.</p>

<p>He had a magic item, the flame amulet of Alzrius, in Polyhedron #135 (written by Erik Mona). Also, while not explicitly stated to be his, one of the armors from the article "Armor of the Abyssal Lords" (Dragon #270) is likely his, as it has a flame theme, and the article says no one knows which lord that armor is attributed to.</p>

<p>Sources: Hellbound: The Blood War, Fiendish Codex I: Hordes of the Abyss<br />
</div></p>

<p>I have to admit, its news to me two although I never thought to check and just assumed we'd made him up. He's certainly not a famous one though and I don't think you've contradicted anything. Just leave him as an Abyssal Lord.</p>

         <p>Abyssal Lords don't have religions.  I made up an entire Religious description here.  I made a story about how he gained godhood.  I gave Alzrius a *CHOSEN* one.  I made it explicitly clear that he's the mentors of two gods of evil and a serious danger to pulling the entirety of the Plane into the Abyss.</p>

<p>I also pointed out specifically in nearly *every* entry I made that his Cult was widespread.</p>

<p>Bluntly, Alzius is my favorite part of this setting and I'm not sure I want to continue on without him just for the sake of preserving the entry (I already modified him from being a Fallen Efreeti in order to fit with that entry that I felt really hurt the character)</p>

<p>I'm not sure its a real good idea to remove all the references.</p>

<p>Yeah and I really don't know how that could be done.  It seems way out there and without really any justification from what we've seen of them so far.  You'd need a seriously interesting story to explain how that works is all I'm saying.</p>

<p>it also seems "out there" to be honest.  I'd love to see an Insect like race write-up or a Sub-race of Insect Dwarves but I think Ortho would be seriously hurt by removing regular Dwarves (THE lawful species) for it.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Epp! I must have missed that entirely in the initial read over - I read it way too fast when I was looking at it and thought it was a "cult of". Abyssal Lords can easily have followers who don't have any understanding of what they're 'worshipping'. While Alzrius doesn't have a lot in canon, it is enough that we want to avoid conflicting with it. It is fairly important that he be an Abyssal Lord as that was one of the primary reasons for the War of Iron, and given that he was trying to shift the crystal sphere of Ortho into the Abyss as an addition to his layer. I'm very sorry that I missed that conflict in your post on it that earlier.<br />

re: the chiton dwarves</span></p>

<p>They're certainly a subrace - the majority of dwarves are more normal dwarves, and that should be reflected in our work with the race. I'm still up in the air on subraces - sub-race/culture information yes - definately! I like the tone on the dwarven race as a whole and wouldn't treat the insectile ones as the standard. The question is where it comes to mechanical support for the subraces, Duckluck had some good reasons against it as a whole. Thoughts?</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

The question is where it comes to mechanical support for the subraces, Duckluck had some good reasons against it as a whole. Thoughts?</div></p>

<p>I like subraces when they're actually different from the mainstream canon.  Duckluck mentioned "When was the last time that you heard of Scro?"  Well, Scro made a very big impression on me and clearly are an influence here.  Also, the conflicts between Silvanesti and Qualinesti lifestyle plus Moon/Sun elves are a major part of the Elven storyline.</p>

<p>For me, it's silly to have Drow and Normal Elves have the same stats.  Likewise Gully Dwarves and normal Dwarves.</p>

<p>If there's a mechanical difference and lifestyle between the subraces, I say go for it.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>On the other hand, it's silly for Dwarves and Deep Dwarves to have <span style="font-style:italic">different</span> stats, given how similar they are. The same goes for gnomes and forest gnomes, elves and wood elves, and orcs and gray orcs. It also gets really hard to balance. Every new subrace you add has to be similar to the standard race but different somehow, but it's really easy to them similar, but <span style="font-style:italic">better</span> instead. The Forest Gnome, for instance, is probably the most powerful LA +0 race in the game. It's a good thing it's hidden in the Monster Manual where most people don't notice it, or else it could be a real game breaker.</p>

<p>I think we have to draw a line: if two groups within a race are culturally different but don't warrant any major statistical differences, we make them the same race and mention the differences in their culture write-up. If two groups are significantly different in both culture, and representative statistics, we treat them like separate races and mention that they're related in their write-ups. Basically, if something isn't different enough to be it's own race, it shouldn't be a sub-race, either.</p>

<p>And yeah, I like Scro too. I was just pointing out how easy it is to make a cool new subrace and then abandon it again.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Let me just throw one last bit as to the importance of sub-races.</p>

<p>If we create Insect-Dwarves and change them to a seperate race with no Dwarf Ties then we might as well be created Thri-Keen.  However, if we create Insect-Dwarves as a Subrace of Dwarves with Different Stats and a Different culture......<span style="font-style:italic">we can still reinforce that they are fundamentally different yet still linked to the Dwarves</span>.  </p>

<p>Drow as the same as Elves would be silly because they live in drastically different environments, cultures, and we'd confuse people reading the entries on elves.  "Elves are happy, free, and good people....except for Drow who are the exact opposite in all ways."  Both races deserve their own entries.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the Insect-Dwarves ties with Dwarves would be a major point of contention and their storytelling elements.  Dwarves might recoil in horror from them or attempt to restore them or perhaps want to deal with them above other races because they're intimately linked.  Like Drow and Elves are both important because they're still cousins.</p>

         <p>I <span style="font-style:italic">did</span> say that if we treat subraces like separate races, we should still mention that they're related. It's just that we don't necessarily have to make a big deal about it. To use Drow as an example, some writers totally define drow by how they relate to standard elves and have every paragraph include something along the lines of "unlike their surface cousins..." Other writers can discuss the drow for pages without even mentioning surface elves. There are reasons to do the former and reasons to do the latter, but mostly it's just a matter of style. </p>

<p>If we go the separate races route for the bug dwarf whatevers, then we'll want to make sure the readers know exactly how they're related to our other dwarves. A couple more direct comparisons would probably be a good idea, but beyond that, how many comparisons we make is up to whoever winds up writing this thing.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">
