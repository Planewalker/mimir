      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>I wonder. I figured "fantasy" became a part of sub-pop culture these days. Especially "normal (modern) fantasy". Movies, video games, stuff that is orientated towards the casual consumer. Feeling familiar with actual mythology strikes me as somewhat nerdier. C'mon, anyone has a say about "trolls" and "angels" and what not from a rather typical fantasyish angle and recalls iconic characters and stories, but how many normal consumers will actually tell you something sophisticated about the roots of those thingies in real mythology?</p>

<p>Ah well, I guess it is true that you can impress people easily if you say "Hey, it's based on like, REAL stuff!" M'eh.<br />
Probably you're right.</p>

<p>... though I stand by my remark that picking up the actual myth clears you of the hassle of dealing with adapted/"inspired" material (that is, a previous interpretation of actual myth by someone else).</p>

<p>I somehow doubt that will have an impact. People who dislike certain things because of "publicity values" and the prestige of some products and genres will not very likely change their not-really-existant opinion of D&amp;D just because Wiz is basing 4e backgrounds more on real world mythology. Maybe they could not even tell the difference. Ahem.</p>

<p>Then again, I don't really know about the US or any place else than europe. Maybe it's a culture/society thing.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>In my experience people over here will buy pretty much anything if it's hyped enough and is polished, playable and sort of fun.  Even if it's the same thing they bought last year.  EA games are a prime example.  I'm not really sure how that will pertain to D&amp;D though.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>i think the lore of any group is its mythology, the actual practice is religion. </p>

<p>as for myth = fiction, discussing which religions we think are(n't?) fictional isn't something i think would be productive.</p>

<p>finally 4e is just a rehash of primordials vs. gods. it's not a bad idea, just not incredibly fresh as planes based on the alignment axes.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

          My 4E review, continued...        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Hi, back again. One area 4E is lacking in is a good array of normal animals. There's horses, wolves and hyenas, and all the rest are monsters... oh yeah, rats, I forgot the rats! Where are the normal animals you'd find in a forest (or have as a familiar)? - gone! I guess they weren't exciting enough... and WHERE'S MY XORN??? My poor beloved Xorn, nowhere to be found in the 4E Monster Manual! If they're not in the second MM or Manual Of The Planes, my warlock will put a curse on WOTC... as for my decision about the game... well, I'm in. I'm buying the books for now, but they had better have a lot of good stuff in that Tome Of Treasures book (the Player's Handbook is kind of scarce on equiptment, just the bare neccesities are included). If most of the rest of you hate the books and don't want to buy them, I understand. And I'm sure not getting rid of my 3E books (or my 2E, 1E, etc...). But 4E is just easier to use and has some features in it I like that aren't in 3E, SOooooo....</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>I really do find it hard to understand the negative reactions to 4e (almost as hard as I've found it hard to understand the negative reactions some D&amp;D gamers have to Planescape and its supposedly "arrogant" fanbase)</p>

<p>I've played D&amp;D way back since the time of the Basic and Expert sets.  Back then, I relied almost solely on my own scenarios, set in my own world.  As (A)D&amp;D moved on I flirted with Greyhawk, Ravenloft, Dragonlance, Dark Sun, FR, Al Qadim and even Spelljammer before finally falling head-over-heels in love with Planescape.  All these settings had their own takes on the rules as presented in the Core books - some changed the cosmology, some the character classes/races (anyone remember how FR elves used to be so much taller than standard, and weren't there some odd rules on multi-classing too?), some the fluff, some the mechanics of the game.   Despite this, no-one was leaping up and down and saying "this doesn't fit" and then blaming the alleged problem on the core rules.</p>

<p>Planescape was not the same game as standard 1st/2nd Edition AD&amp;D - it introduced new mechanics, classes, races and vastly expanded the early hints as to the roles of Daemons/loths, Devils and Demons.  That wasn't a problem.  Planescape is not the same game as standard 4th edition, that's not a problem, either - in my game, the cosmology, the history, the classes and races are what I say they are, whatever edition and setting I'm playing.</p>

<p>4th edition shouldn't be judged on how it fits with Planescape, or any other setting.  It should be judged by how it works as a game.  For what it's worth, I think it works excellently and IMHO much better than 3/3.5e (I'll remind everyone of how we howled when we saw what that game did to our beloved 'loths).  Wizards have abandoned spurious "realism" and produced a system that (while certainly not perfect - but when was any edition of D&amp;D perfect?) is easy to learn, easy to play and yet has real depth hidden beneath the surface.  The new rulebooks are clearly set out, clearly written and will, I hope, help to bring in new players to the hobby.  </p>

<p>4e has got me interested in gaming again.  I'm already getting ready to tweak the wonderful work of Planewalker into the 4th edition and I hope others will too.  Like it or don't like it as you see fit but is there really any reason to loathe it?</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Well, my main problem is the rampant shameless commercialism and complete lack of regard for the fanbase beyond their wallets.</p>

<p>I just don't think that it's 'OK' to be motivated solely by money and thus rip off your customers every chance you get.</p>

<p>4E seems to be based around the same sort of concept as MMORPGs, which I hate.  They've made everything simpler, but that means they've removed many options as well.  It's all to get more people who don't currently like 3E because it has a learning curve to buy D&amp;D books.</p>

<p>Then there's the monthly fee, which you can bet will be practically essential, but also a ripoff.  The heavy emphasis on miniatures and hack and slash gameplay... Well, it's basically enhancing the emphasis on everything I don't like, and nothing I do.</p>

<p>At least that's what I've gathered from all the articles, interviews, and testimonials that I've read.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>And, of course, we would never want <span style="font-style:italic">new</span> people to start playing RPG's. That would taint our purity of vision.  :roll: </p>

<p>Seriously. So it's a relatively simple RPG. Why is that bad? If it brings in new players, that should be <span style="font-style:italic">good</span>. Anything that makes RPGs more mainstream or more succesful is a win in my book. Anyone who wants a more complex RPG has endless other options available.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>Simply put.  The type of gamer it'll bring in is most likely the type that thinks that roleplaying is for 'fags' and will continue to hold that believe with every 'mob' that they kill.  I'm talking about MMORPGers.  I'm sure you think that it's some myth or something but as someone who's played MMORPGs I can tell you that it most certainly is not.  The MMORPGamer is a vicious creature with an insatiable apatite for 'phat lootz', 'lulz' and 'lulz hax omfg stfu nub'  Yes, that doesn't even make sense when translated to any accepted language in the multiverse.  The majority of MMORPGamers play specifically to 'pwn bichez' and then tell them they are 'teh sux' they're quite happy to pay the monthly fee as that's exactly the type of thing they need to do with their chosen stomping grounds anyway though it's usually their parents that are paying.  If you have yet to experience the sheer unadulterated horror of the MMORPGamer then I envy you, and that is why 4E must not succeed in it's evil plot for world domination.  For the sake of innocence, it must be stopped.</p>

<p>Hm... maybe I shouldn't post at 6:30 am after staying up all night with insomnia.  Stupid insomnia.  Makes me barmy.  Seriously though.  It's going to be hell if we get allot of people like that playing D&amp;D.  Personally though I don't think they'll stay around long.  I think they'll all tire of the creativity requirement inherent in PnP games like D&amp;D and return to their lairs, and then 4E will flop and Wizards will kill D&amp;D off for good, leaving only their miniatures line which is allot more profitable anyway.</p>

<p>If you can truly enjoy a mainstream product over a niche product that suits your specific likes well, I envy you.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>If you can truly enjoy a mainstream product over a niche product that suits your specific likes well, I envy you.</div></p>

<p>I can not agree with you more. I've been saying the same thing since 4.0's release and all I have gotten in response is "it isn't that bad" and "I'd run a game with it." I think that WotC should switch to 3.5 and STAY there before they waste MORE money on the eventual 4.5 release.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>Even supposing that this will lure in the HaXor Pkers (which I dont think is necessarily correct), this neglects to address two things. a) Most of us did exactly that when we first played D&amp;D (I know I did, and really every edition of D&amp;D lent itself to that mode of play, lets not kid ourselves), but yet matured over time and ventured into richer ideas and richer systems (I dumped D&amp;D eventually because I found it to be, basically, geared towards hack and slash) and b) we don't have to acually play with anyone we don't want to, unlike an MMORPG. So really, for all intents and purposes, the hypothetical existence of such RPers has little to no impact on us at all. However, what you neglect to acknowledge is the possibility that, in drawing in this new cadre of players, some of them may actually be *gasp* perfectly reasonable human beings that were turned off by the initial complexity of roleplaying systems. I will happily accept 20 idiot gamers if it means 1 more legitimate gamer, because I dont ever have to play with those 20 people, but now have 1 more person I might well invite to play in a game.</p>

<p>And hell, my personal experience, anecdotal though it is, has more or less reflected this trend. People are turned off by the complexity of most roleplaying in my experience. But, in almost every case where I have introduced roleplaying with simple mechanics and a laid back concept, I've won a convert. Three of those people eventually became badass roleplayers. These are people with no prior exposure, and no prior interest, who were all adults. And guess what they were mostly fascinated with at first? Power accumulation and hack and slash. Because, really, that's pretty natural thing to be interested in at first. As with all things in life, true appreciation of nuance and subtelty only come with experience. No one reads Brothers Karamazov out of the gate. And if they did, they probably wouldn't get much of it anyway. </p>

<p>Gaming elitism is really just like any other form of elitism. Once you've achieved a certain level of understanding, many people forget how they got there in the first place, and they disdain beginners because they aren't in the know. 4e is, in many respects, like basic D&amp;D was. It's going back to basics. I think they may have something there. Roleplaying has become so codified by its own conventions that it sometimes isolates new gamers. I think 3e was actually a step in this same direction, which you may not recognize (hello modern sleek artwork and simplified rules). 4e is just a further step. It says "Beginners welcome" all over it, and frankly I welcome that populist sentiment. </p>

<p>Personally, I get tired of all the crumdgeonly gamers who would just as soon the world keep out of their special little universe. It is exactly that kind of attitude that results in roleplayers retaining this anti-social stigma. This isn't highschool anymore. We aren't privvy to secret knowledge. None of these people are going to steal our lunch money. Some of them may even become our friends and fellow gamers. You can immediately reject them for being "unsophisticated gamers" but I would rather welcome them into the fold openly and give them a chance. Rationalizing the rejection doesn't change the fact that you are rejecting these people without giving them a chance. Hmm, what highschool steretype does <span style="font-style:italic">that</span> sound like?</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

          Hack and Slashers        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>The idea that 4E is only going to attract "Hack 'n Slash"-type players is silly. EVERY edition of D&amp;D has been compatible with someone who wanted to play that way... there hasn't been a set of rules made that could keep a berk from playing that way if he wanted to! Look at the old, old D&amp;D rules sets... pure hack n' slash, with maybe a little thought given to the alternative. In any game edition, a player can alway say, "I think I'll negotiate with those Orcs over there, instead of fighting them"... if there's none of that going on, it's because of the player (or maybe the Dm!) and not the game rules. Whether 4th Edition "sucks" or not, it IS possible to play in without resorting to killing every monster in sight... The only way you could FORCE players to play nice is to make them so weak that they CAN'T kill anything (say, give 'em 1 hit point apiece, a whimpy AC, etc... so that they're AFRAID to attack anything!!!). But that's a whole 'nother game then...</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Elitism this elitism that.  Elitist has basically become a word to put down people who are willing to try their best rather than just wait for other people to do it for them like everyone else.  It's just used to make people feel better about their own lack of will to improve themselves.</p>

<p>Maybe my opinions are simly biased by my own experiences.  Every tabletop game I've been in has been a hack fest.  I really don't want to see the internet become the same.  In the end it is a matter of taste though.  Some people are perfectly happy with the dumbed down version.  I like a little complexity and options.  Maybe a few more good gamers will join that aren't 'tards' but I don't think that the sacrifice is worth it considering that 'tards' are definitely what they're trying to lure in.  Like I said though.  I don't see it working, and I see Wizards killing off D&amp;D for good after 4E.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>FWIW I've just finished the DMG.  Readers of these boards may be surprised to know it spends, if anything, more time on the question of different styles of play, the need to satisfy everyone - including those keen on acting, storytelling &amp;c and not just the "let's nuke these guys" crowd - than previous DMGs.  Add in the emphasis on encounters involving large areas, multiple creatures, the environment and skill challenges, the encouragement for DM creativity and this reminder of the needs of all the DM's players and I actually think this is a big improvement over 3e.  </p>

<p>Then again, as I said before, I'm an old gamer.  For me 3e fell by the wayside in trying to come up with a rule (and often a complicated rule) to cover everything.  4e encourages greater use of rules of thumb, extrapolations from similar systems and general "it's not in here but this makes sense" ruling and thus, IMO, gives more time to roleplaying and less to flipping through books while some berk (I use the word in the UK English sense) shows off his deep knowledge of all 12,000 rules supplements.  </p>

<p>The fact I never got to grips with 3e/3.5e is just down to the way I play.  I didn't hate either edition, I just preferred 2e (even though it was a horribly inconsistent system patched up with house rules).  I can see why people may not be wild about 4e but really, why the hate?  If you want to hate WotC, hate them for the fact they abandoned Planescape a decade ago, not because they've changed the core rules.  As I said before - for me it's the world I play in that's important - the rules are just an aid to help me and my players enjoy that world.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>You mean like you complaining on a board about new D&amp;D rules and suggesting a successful company should forgo taking the most profitable path and more or less asking them to do you the favor of creating a system for your narrowly defined benefit? Is that some new form of self improvement? 'Cause for some reason that sounds exactly like someone not wanting to improve themselves and waiting for someone else to do it to me. </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Maybe my opinions are simly biased by my own experiences.  Every tabletop game I've been in has been a hack fest.  I really don't want to see the internet become the same.  In the end it is a matter of taste though.</div></p>

<p>Absolutely. And I, for one, take that problem into my own hands by playing a variety of systems, rather than expecting one gaming system to magically cater to my every need. And, in a couple cases, I've straight up designed my own systems to fit my needs. And 4e will impact exactly none of this.  The fact is, D&amp;D is pretty much [i]the[/]i introductory role playing game. It has comparatively simple rules, a straightforward premise, and a familiar brand name. The fact that you consider 3e to be an ideal system for the gaming connoisseur frankly boggles my mind. Generally d20 is ranked way low in the view of "serious" gamers for the very reason that it is a poorly thought out set of game mechanics. And if your complaint is about world detail and complexity, well, 3e was a pretty big step down from 2e in nearly every respect. 3e itself was pretty much a redesign aimed squarely at bringing in new gamers. 4e is just taking that idea further. Is it simple? Yeah. But D&amp;D has always been simple. Most of its richness is the work of the DM. Planescape is about the only setting with any real nuance to it, and they ditched it in 3e. </p>

<p> I've never gone to D&amp;D because it was a good set of rules. I never went to it because it presented me with an enticing game world (with the exception of Planescape). I've used it mostly in cases where I wanted something simple, familiar, and accessible, that gave me plenty of room to play around. If what you seek is complexity, detail, or "high end" gaming, there are a number of far better systems out there. D&amp;D is a basic gaming system. The fact that they made it better at what it already was designed for should only be disappointing to those who've been too lazy to explore other systems, or are too lazy to create their own house rules and campaign detail.  </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Some people are perfectly happy with the dumbed down version.  I like a little complexity and options.  Maybe a few more good gamers will join that aren't 'tards' but I don't think that the sacrifice is worth it considering that 'tards' are definitely what they're trying to lure in.  Like I said though.  I don't see it working, and I see Wizards killing off D&amp;D for good after 4E.</div></p>

<p>What's retarded is complaining about a company taking a course of action that they have researched extensively, with the intent of keeping themselves relevant and profitable. I hate d20, never liked 3e, and have interpersonal reasons for disliking the WotC leadership, but I can recognize the good they do for the gaming community, and the underlying wisdom in their choices. Their success has helped keep gaming shops alive, and has helped keep role playing alive. Their success with D&amp;D has been predicated almost entirely on the populism you apparently despise, but yet which you rather ironically rely upon, seeing as you apparently need them to provide you with 3e support for your gaming. </p>

<p>In the grand scheme of things, to anyone with ability as a DM, it should ultimately matter far less that 3e stop being supported than it should that WotC remain successful. A resourceful DM already has more than enough tools at their disposal to continue 3e ad infinitum if they are so inclined. Since you are so opposed to those who are lazy and expect others to do work for them, you really shouldn't have any objection to doing that yourself.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>'If you don't like it just lower your standards.'  I've seen that so much recently.  That is not self improvement.  They aren't doing me any favors by not ripping me off.  They're just being decent.  The main difference between my so called 'narrow definition' and their supposedly wider one is that theirs is more profitable.

Wizards has a successful product, they're much more likely to stop being successful by overstepping their bounds and alienating their customers with a product that snubs them and is still just as flawed by releasing a new improved edition of their previous product.</p>

<p>They didn't, really; they just folded it into Core.

<p>4th edition is the first major break from the Planescape continuity since 1994. If we're going to "hate" them for abandoning Planescape, the time for that is now.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

          4e I Has It, Is Garbage!        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>So, I've got 4th ed now (well, the PHB and MM, at least.  I concluded that the DMG was a waste of money and didn't buy it.  I think you'll see why).  I really don't think it's a bad system, although it does have its problems.  It's definitly a compleatly new system, at least, so you can't complain at WotC for expecting us to buy a complete rehash of 3.x with some minor changes.</p>

<p>The new cut down alignment system is more than a little silly, you can easilly tell that it was chopped down from a more complete system, both by reading the descriptions of the alignments and by reading the descriptions and alignments of the various gods and monsters (both the God of Civilization, devoted to law, order, and pushing back the wilderness, and the God of Nature, devoted to freedom, nature, and pushing back civilization, are listed as Unaligned, which is defined to mean that they don't take a stand on alignment.  The Marut and other similar creatures are also listed as Unaligned).</p>

<p>That Skill challenge thing I was going on about earlier?  <a href="http://www.enworld.org/showthread.php?t=229919&amp;page=1&amp;pp=15" class="bb-url">hopelessly broken</a>.  This is a big part of why I didn't buy the DMG.</p>

<p>That's the bad.  The good is that as long as you don't mind Martial types with limited-use abilities, game balance looks to have taken a giant step forward.  </p>

<p>I personally think that 4th ed is plenty compatible with planescape.  Sure, the monster stat blocks are much less detailed than the 3rd edition ones, but so are the stat blocks in 2nd edition.  Alignment may have been cut down to the point of absurdity, but there are no mechanics dealing with it, making it a snap to change back.  They may have swiched cosmologies on us, but there is almost no cosmology information in the core rule books, so....</p>

<p>...and that's my two cents.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author"><em>&#039;Dire Lemon&#039;</em> wrote:</div></p>

<p>'If you don't like it just lower your standards.'  I've seen that so much recently.  That is not self improvement.  They aren't doing me any favors by not ripping me off.  They're just being decent.  The main difference between my so called 'narrow definition' and their supposedly wider one is that theirs is more profitable.  My definition wasn't so narrow when it matched their's.</div></p>

<p>Im not asking you to lower your standards. That is a pretty bizarre interpretation of what I wrote. What I am saying is that your standards are arbitrary and inconsistent. You say people should, in essence, work at roleplaying, but dont hold yourself to that same standard. </p>

<p>On a related note, you assert that, basically, WotC shouldn't aim to be profitable. Yet you expect them to make a game, for you. That is absurd on its face. If WotC is <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> profitable, they won't make any game of any kind, which doesn't benefit anyone. TSR folded precisely because they mismanaged their company and aimed more at pleasing themselves than at providing a marketable game. It is a distinct possibility we wouldn'thave <span style="font-style:italic">any</span> D&amp;D if WotC hadn't swooped in, bought up the rights to D&amp;D, and reworked it into a more populist, easy to understand format, in the form of 3e (which, paradoxically, you seem to like). </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>
As a poor gamer, I don't have allot of money to throw around at systems I probably won't be able to find anyone to play with me. 
 I also happen to like D&amp;D's settings and concepts. </div></p>

<p>That's great. All those concepts are still around. No one plans on burning your books because of 4th edition I imagine. So, everything is still there, as it was the day before. What you are complaining about is that WotC would have the audacity not to release <span style="font-style:italic">new</span> materials that you approve of. And what I am saying is, is that this is a pretty spoiled attitude to take. WotC exists to make money. They can't provide games unless they make money. It is truly ridiculous that you think it reasonable that they should opt to support you and those like you to the exclusion of their profits. Again, that sort of contradicts your ubermensch stance. What, are we on roleplaying welfare now? They're a business. They have to make business decisions, otherwise in very short order, there will be no game of any kind. If that means popularizing D&amp;D further, I maintain that this is superior to no D&amp;D at all. </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>D&amp;D is fairly popular.  I know I like it, and there's an decent chance of finding someone to play it with me even if only on the internet.</div></p>

<p>You can get anyone to play just about any system if you play on the internet. D&amp;D is far from exclusive in that respect. And usually, most roleplayers, if they are creative or are well read, will be more than happy to play in just about any setting you throw at them. If they aren't, then they probably aren't exactly shining beacons of roleplaying excellence. </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Making D&amp;D more popular at the expense of apparently everything else I like about it isn't worth it to me. </div></p>

<p>You are, conversely, asking D&amp;D to be unpopular, at the expense of its existence. </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>It doesn't make a very strong argument to say 'you're wrong and there are multiple reasons why' and then not supply any of those reasons as evidence.</div></p>

<p>Im not really sure what you mean there, but I gave plenty of lines of argument relating to my assertions. Whether you think they are valid or not doesn't negate them.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>What's retarded is faithfully defending a company for taking a course of action that's only goal is to furthur increase their profitse by whatever means necessary even if it means completely ripping off the consumer in every way possible. </div></p>

<p>Who is getting ripped off exactly? Did you buy fourth edition wth no insight into what it was about? If not, how exactly were you cheated? They are offering a full game that, amazingly enough, we don't have to buy, and which we have the full ability to review prior to purchase. No one tricked you. No one stole anything from you. It's just false to say anyone is being ripped off unless you can site a reason for this claim.  </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>This is not a matter of survival.  It's a matter of greed.</div></p>

<p>It pretty much <span style="font-style:italic">is</span> a matter of survival. Big gaming corporations have gone bankrupt many times when they didn't manage their product. TSR died because they <span style="font-style:italic">didn't</span> do what WotC is willing to do. Same goes for FASA. WotC itself almost folded, and was barely managing to float by for three years. If you do not offer people something new and different, it is the trend of consumers to stop buying the product. New mild tweaks simply do not generate sales for more than a few years. Eventually you need to offer consumers something different enough that they feel like they are not just getting the same thing all over again. That is a pretty basic business concept. WotC is making a tough decision but is trying to keep their core game relevant in three ways. First they are making it more accessible, which helps bring in new gamers in a very competitive niche market. Second, they are offering old gamers something new enough that previous material does not make largely redundant. Third it keeps them competitive within their market. MMORPGs are drawing people away from traditional roleplaying. Other fantasy hack and slash systems are on the market and are succesful enough that they've cut into WotC's sales. WotC does not operate in a vacuum. They have to compete for their business. It's just a simple reality. </p>

<p>For most established gamers, a saturation point is reached with a product line where additonal investment seems unnecessary. I reached that point extremely quickly wth 3e. Other people take longer. Some people, such as yourself, will gladly buy new products for an old system as long as they are released. However, if past history is any indicator (and it is the only non-anecdotal indicator we really have), most people are not like you. </p>

<p> <div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>All a corporation cares about is getting higher profits, more wealth at the expense of those who don't have as much as them. </div></p>

<p>That's a very strong view, and I can appreciate that corporations aren't exactly benevolent, but it's only fair to consider that the existence of D&amp;D is possible only because of corporations.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Wizards has a successful product, they're much more likely to stop being successful by overstepping their bounds and alienating their customers with a product that snubs them and is still just as flawed by releasing a new improved edition of their previous product.</div></p>

<p>Possibly. It may end up that they made the wrong decision. But I think they are in a far better position to judge that then you or I.</p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Working is important, but anyone can work.  Working isn't anything special.  What's special is thinking and creativity.  That's what causes the creation things, like civilization, and a truly great game.</div></p>

<p>Right. And what I am saying is, since you are presumably a creative person, is that you should be able to resolve these problems through the application of creativity and intelligence.  Does that require some work? Yeah, certainly, but so does any creative act. I wasn't promoting the virtue of work so much as the virtue of producing your own value in the face of an unsatisfying alternative. </p>

<p><div class="quote-msg"><div class="quote-author">Quote:</div>Everything these days is going towards this 'populist' attitude of treating people like idiots while telling them they're smart, then screwing them over.</div></p>

<p>That's really not a new trend. And I am not promoting populism in the strictest sense. My argument in that regard is that, in this case, the existence of a populist game in a gaming market is not inherently bad, and has a set of benefits. If the <span style="font-style:italic">only</span> gaming option available to me were 4e, I would be upset. But that really isn't remotely reflective of the reality. I think 4e makes a decent intro game for new gamers that lays the groundwork for other richer, more detailed games. That does me no harm, can benefit new gamers, and can potentially benefit me by creating a larger pool of potential gamers, some of whom will undoubtedly be perfectly intelligent and capable roleplayers.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

          Dumbing down the game        </div>
      
      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>I don't like the implication that if something is easy to understand and easy to use, that it equates to "dumbing down". So a set of game rules isn't any good unless it's real complicated and you have to consult charts and do a lot of math before you can cast a spell? If you can play it without having a degree in Algebra, the game sucks? Excuse me, but some of us have been waiting for a less-complicated roleplaying system for YEARS, something that we can play without having to repeatedly check charts before performing anything other than a basic attack! I like that now a 8th level Wizard can (GASP!) cast 8th level spells... it's more logical and intuitive than consulting a chart every time. And skills in 3E/3.5 were a pain in the caboose, too... I hope this will not devolve into a "flame war" between those who like 4E and those who hate it, but this conversation seems awfully one-sided... why not borrow a friend's copy of 4E and TRY it? (Or try the library, some of them have D&amp;D books!). If you don't wanna buy it, then don't... I didn't buy 3.5 because I was annoyed at the changes, but I'd never tell a 3.5 fan "Stop playing that game, don't you know it sucks! I sure hope 3.5 bombs and nobody buys it!" If 4E fails, there might not be a 5E, and who knows, maybe 5E would've fixed all the things you don't like!</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>4th edition is the first major break from the Planescape continuity since 1994. If we're going to "hate" them for abandoning Planescape, the time for that is now.</div><br />
Sounds like a plan.</p>

<p>-420</div></p>

<p>Personally I don't hate them.</p>

<p>It lets us move on with the conversion unhindered for the moment. We don't have to make sure we've matched our work to everything they're releasing anymore. We don't have to keep in synch with their canon now.</p>

<p>So: It's not a problem.</p>

<p>On the other hand, everyone remember we're friends here. (Or at least like-minded fans) 3.x or even 1st and 2nd didn't work for everyone, 4th isn't going to be the silver bullet of gaming either. I think that everyone agrees on that. Keep cool heads and warm hearts - preferably still beating though I'm sure the 'loths amongst you would like them on silver platters. <img src="sites/all/modules/smileys/packs/Example/wink.png" title="Eye-wink" alt="Eye-wink" class="smiley-content"/></p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p>4e really is a boneheaded move as far as I can see.</div></p>

<p>When I read over what little of 4.0 I did, I remembered the powers system from Warcraft. I, myself, haven't seen much of WotC bashing on the older versions of DnD but the fact that they would consider the fluff to be broken is a weird thing. </p>

<p>Also, as someone who came into DnD a little late, I love looking back at my friends collection of Dragon magazines and some of the amazing articles. DDI is <span style="font-style:italic">horrible</span>...and that's putting it lightly. While DDI has some good features like the art galleries of books which I find useful for my players (which lack any sort of an imagination). Besides that they ony useful thing is the "Ask Sage" section of the site is also somewhat helpful for the random situations. Besides those two things though the site is filled with a lot of garbage. Also, call me sentimental or what you will, but I think that the main site to dungeons and dragons should have more of a tribute to the game's creators passing then a simple page that was up for probably three weeks. </p>

<p>About their advertising, from what I've seen, It did seem like they were coming off a little over confident, almost to the level of being cocky about 4.0. I do recall one instance when they attacked their one grapple rules from 3.5, calling them "too complicated" as well as things like sunder saying it was "never used". I don't want to pass a judgment without having more knowledge about that particular endeavor. </p>

<p>I will say though that WotC is going down the same route with DnD that they did with the Magic: The Gathering TCG, which I have also stopped purchasing due to the horrid card design and the addition of far too many new rules.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

<p></div></p>

<p>You are essentially aserting that, because you personally don't like these changes, that therefore it is a bad business decision. While this may turn out to be true, at the moment you are just speculating. Your personal preference may be representative, but I think it just as likely that your personal preferences are simply a conserative desire to preserve what you know, which is not reflective of the attitudes of a new player, a player indifferent to 3e, or a player who doesnt mind changing systems. I also suspect that those groups are much larger than the group you belong to</p>

<p>That fact is though, we really don't have any hard data to draw any conclusions as to who is right as of the moment. I simply suspect they have a much better idea of what will and will not sell than you or I, because they have in all likelyhood researched what will sell. So, given that you and I lack concrete data, and they almost certainly <span style="font-style:italic">do</span> have concrete data, I defer to their knowledge and strategy. </p>

<p>I clearly am not nearly so invested in 3e as you are, as I've never really been a fan of it to begin with, and I tend to invent my own fluff as readily as I use existing stuff. For example, I prefer to elaborate on a dead campaign setting, in the form of planescape, more than I prefer to use any supported 3e setting (including post-planescape planar material). I have always found canon material to be inconsistent in quality and vision, so I have never found it worth sticking to, or even caring about. To me, it has always been a pick and choose sort of relationship. What amazes me is that so many people <span style="font-style:italic">are</span> that attached to 3e, and I guess I just have a very hard time identifying with that. To me, 3e just wasn't very good, especially when compared to a number of other systems floating, so I am surprised I guess that so many people apparently think it is the Gospel of RPGs. </p>

<p>The only thing I can personally compare it to is when they swtiched over from 3rd edition shadowrun to 4th edition, which involved a major rules rewrite, and a huge jump forward in storyline, to the point of effectively making previous fluff largely irrelevant. But to me, that was just mildly disappointing. I felt, and still feel that there is more than enough material to draw from and elaborate upon, and that even the recent releases for 3rd edition Shadowrun had me shrugging my shoulders. Not because the material sucked, or was useless, but just because it was a level of detail that I felt wasn't really needed for the most part except for the more completist minded gamer. 90% of it were issues a creative GM had already thought of, or were rules that were unlikely to be employed, or could just as easily be solved through roleplaying and an on the fly house ruling. </p>

<p>I will add that the reason they dropped 4e so suddenly is because when they annouced that they were going to drop 3.5e, people stopped buying existing products, which almost tanked their entire roleplaying division. This time, they tried to have a decent set of products ready out of the gate so that they didn't repeat that mistake.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

      <div class="forum-post-content">
         <p>i'm criticizing their advertising of the fluff changes more than the changes themselves. one the advantages of the online magazines was support for more setting material or so they claimed. as such they could easily just have a new core cosmology and leave the old one for those who liked it - the more cosmologies the better after all. they could easily have not had celestials in their new cosmology while leaving the door open for information on guardinals rather than gleefully snarking "we put a bullet in their heads".</p>

<p>the designers decided to be jackasses and thus a potential consumer like myself won't buy anything 4e unless its second-hand and gives wizards no profit. that was something that could easily have been avoided with a little respect to the works that they've been shelling for the last decade. </p>

<p>additonally, not telling us about 4.0 might have been understandable if it was a backwards compatible system. by deceiving the consumer that they were buying products that would become obsolete. Now it's just a matter of waiting for 4.5...</p>

<p>that wizards doesn't have clue on what will sell can be seen via their DDI which is nothing but vaporware. This is just like the online magazines which were supposed to be a preview then became a testing phase. Then there is the $15/month - a price for which you can play an entire MMORPG -- or you can play NWN for no charge with your friends. Their entire pricing model is laughable. </p>

<p>Paizo CEO Lisa Stevens noted that PnP rpg markets are shrinking which can only be expected as programmed games simulate more and more roleplaying. This is the common wisdom and I've seen nothing to refute it. Points of Light as a setting plan is idiotic because it can be done as well if not better via a programmed game. This is why the two rpgs I've most loved have been Mage: The Ascension and Planescape, it's far harder if not impossible to duplicate the kind of adventures they offer in a program.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">

         <p>Sorry, Dire Lemon, if I ticked you off...  :cry:  I'm not trying to make hard feelings or anything, I'm just saying don't you remember when 3E first came out, everyone said they hated it, it was not true D&amp;D, WOTC had created a dud and it was going to be a collosal failure, etc, etc...? Now some of those people are hardcore 3E/3.5 supporters, praising the virtures of 3E/3.5 wheras before, they said they'd never play it! And 3E did change some of the monsters and deities; Gruumush became Chaotic Evil (he was LE before), Maruts became Inevitables, and so on. In the immortal words of Dr. Seus... "I am Sam. Sam I am.

<p>That's an interesting point. I imagine their reason is that MMORPGs are competing with their business, so they need to compete right back. But you may well be right that their best option may be to instead refine their niche to avoid competition all together. Still, the failure of settings like Planescape financially is a pretty grave historical reminder of what usually awaits such high concept games, even if a small group of us are fanatical about them. Really though, that is probably an issue of scale. Keep the costs low, and I think such a system can be succesful, because it will be more scaled to the size of the audience.</p> <div class="dice_rolls">
